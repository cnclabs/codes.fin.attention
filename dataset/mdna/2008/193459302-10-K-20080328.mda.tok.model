on october   the day before we consummated the private placement  we ceased to be an s corporation and became a c corporation and  as such  are now subject to federal and state income tax 
as a result of the termination of our s corporation status  we recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately million to our income tax provision to recognize the estimated amount of previously unrecognized net deferred income tax liability 
income tax expense in reflects our status as a c corporation for the entire year  compared to the expense recorded in  which reflects the above noted conversion in october the financial data reflects the retroactive presentation of the for stock split which occurred on october  ebitda represents earnings from continuing operations before net interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
other companies may define ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda of other companies 
ebitda is a performance measure and liquidity measure used by our management  and we believe it is commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measure of a company s operating performance and ability to incur and service 
table of contents debt 
our management believes that ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of our business on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers for evaluation and planning purposes  including the preparation of annual operating budgets and the determination of levels of operating and capital investments 
in particular  our management believes that ebitda is a meaningful measure because it allows management to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
for example  our management believes that the inclusion of items such as taxes  interest expense  intangible asset amortization and interest income can make it more difficult to identify and assess operating trends affecting our business and industry 
furthermore  our management believes that ebitda is a performance measure that provides investors  securities analysts and other interested parties with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
finally  ebitda also closely tracks consolidated ebitda  a liquidity measurement that is used in calculating financial covenants in both our credit facility and the indenture for our senior notes 
ebitda s usefulness as a performance measure is limited by the fact that it excludes the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use ebitda as the sole measure of our performance and liquidity 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity

our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties  including those described under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we assume no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report 
overview we are a leading designer  developer  manufacturer and supplier of electrical wire and cable products for consumer  commercial and industrial applications  with operations primarily in the us and  to a lesser degree  canada 
we manufacture and supply a broad line of wire and cable products  which enables us to offer our customers a single source of supply for many of their wire and cable product requirements 
we manufacture our products in ten domestic manufacturing facilities and supplement our domestic production with both international and domestic sourcing 
we sell our products to a variety of customers  including a wide range of specialty distributors  retailers and original equipment manufacturers oems 
virtually all of our products are sold to customers located in the us and canada 
we currently have four reportable business segments electrical wire and cable distributors  specialty distributors and oems  consumer outlets  and copperfield 
these segment classifications are based on an aggregation of customer groupings and distribution channels because this is how we manage and evaluate our business 
we sell virtually all of our products across each of our four segments  except that our fabricated bare wire products sales are only in our specialty distributors and oems segment  and copperfield segment 
our net sales  to some extent  follow general business cycles 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in net sales and cash flow 
net sales are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters due to increased buying in anticipation of  and during  the winter months and holiday season 
production costs overview  impact of copper prices and current business environment as part of understanding our business and operating results  an overview of the relative composition of our production costs is useful 
raw materials  primarily copper  comprise the primary component of our cost of goods sold 
for  copper costs have been estimated by us based on the average comex price to account for approximately of our total cost of goods sold 
because labor costs have historically represented less than of our total cost of goods sold  we do not believe competition from products produced in countries having lower labor rates has significantly effected our financial results 
we buy our copper from both domestic and international suppliers at prevailing market prices  with the price we pay dependent largely on the price of copper on international commodities markets 

table of contents as the price of copper is particularly volatile  price fluctuations can affect a significant portion of our net sales and profitability 
we generally attempt to pass along changes in the price of copper and other raw materials to our customers 
our ability to pass along price increases is greater when copper prices increase quickly and significantly 
gradual price increases may be more difficult to pass on to our customers and may affect our short term profitability 
conversely  the prices of our products tend to fall more quickly in the event the price of copper drops significantly over a relatively short period of time and more slowly in the event of more gradual decreases in the price of copper 
our specialty distributors and oems segment offers a number of products that are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in copper prices 
other factors affecting product pricing include the type of product involved  competitive conditions  including underutilized manufacturing capacity in our industry  and particular customer arrangements 
the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound during the twelve months ended december   up from the twelve months ended december  the average copper price on the comex was and for january and february  respectively 
copper volatility as well as general market uncertainty have driven fluctuating market demand across a number of our channels  factors which we believe are likely to continue in looking at  we believe projected costs savings from an integrated copperfield and the anticipated benefit to be derived in the back half of from the addition of woods  is expected to offset the negative impact of current economic conditions and rising material and freight costs 
acquisitions from time to time  we consider acquisition opportunities that could materially increase the size of our business operation 
we made two acquisitions during which have significantly increased our scale and presented us with what we believe are a number of strategic benefits 
copperfield  llc on april   we acquired of the outstanding equity interests of copperfield  llc copperfield for million  including acquisition related costs and working capital adjustments 
at the time of our acquisition  copperfield was one of the largest privately owned manufacturers and suppliers of electrical wire and cable products in the us  with annual sales in excess of million 
woods industries  inc on november   we acquired the electrical products business of katy industries  inc  which operates in the us as woods industries  inc woods us and in canada as woods industries canada inc 
woods canada  collectively referred to herein as woods woods 
the principal business of woods is the design and distribution of consumer electrical cord products  which are sold principally to national home improvement  mass merchant  hardware and other retailers 
we purchased certain assets of woods us and all the stock of woods canada for million  including acquisition related costs  but subject to finalization of working capital adjustments 
integration in november  our board approved a planned strategy for integrating copperfield  including the streamlining of manufacturing operations and cost reductions that were considered at the time of the acquisition 
as part of this plan  copperfield manufacturing and distribution facilities located in avilla  indiana  nogales  arizona  and el paso  texas will be closed in and operations at these locations consolidated into a larger  state of the art facility in el paso  texas 
in addition  we have realignments planned for all remaining copperfield facilities 
we expect to incur between million and million in restructuring costs in for such activities  and estimate that these measures will result in net cash expenditures of approximately million to million in depending on various factors including the timing of the sale of owned properties and the amount of proceeds received 
we anticipate substantially completing these activities by the end of  with the expectation that the changes will result in annual cash savings of approximately million in and subsequent years 
we also have a major project underway to consolidate a number of our midwest distribution centers into a single expanded distribution facility in pleasant prairie  wisconsin 
this new  square foot leased distribution center  which we plan to open in april of  is designed to meet the growing demands of our business and 
table of contents should allow for greater efficiency and reduced costs in conducting our distribution operations 
the new facility will handle all distribution functions currently conducted at three separate facilities  including one we acquired as part of the woods acquisition  and we are confident that the new facility will establish a platform for continuing our track record of providing first in class logistics  delivery  and customer service 
we expect to incur total costs between approximately million and million as a result of the above described plan  primarily facility closure and severance related costs 
the majority of the cash expenditures are expected to be treated as a purchase accounting adjustment to be recorded in  with the remainder accounted for as restructuring or operating expense in in addition  as a result of the plan  we have accelerated depreciation for certain fixed assets located at the facilities to be closed  and expect to record incremental depreciation expense of approximately million in due to this acceleration 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statement of operations data in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
the results for include the results of operations of our acquisitions beginning with their respective acquisition dates 
accordingly  our results of operations include approximately nine months of operating results for copperfield and one month of operating results for woods

the increase includes the impact of adding the copperfield business on april   which accounted for million of our consolidated net sales in  and an increase of in our consolidated net sales for as compared to excluding copperfield  our net sales increased million in  or  compared to  with the increase primarily reflecting volume growth measured in terms of pounds of product shipped within our consumer outlets segment  including the impact of the woods business  and the impact of price increases associated with raw material cost increases 
our total volume increased in  with current year acquisitions accounting for a increase in our total volume compared to levels 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  our total volume declined  primarily reflecting decreased demand from existing customers in both our specialty distributors and oems segment and our electrical wire and cable distributors segment 
gross profit we generated million in total gross profit in compared to million in  an increase of million 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin for was compared to for both the increase in gross profit dollars and decline in gross profit margin for 
table of contents primarily reflect the impact of adding copperfield in april copperfield prices its products to earn a fixed dollar gross profit per pound of goods sold  which serves to mitigate the effect of copper price volatility  but which compresses gross profit margins when the market price for copper increases 
excluding copperfield  which generated million in gross profit for  our gross profit declined million in and our gross profit margin declined as a percentage of net sales  as compared to these declines reflect the impact of pricing pressures throughout due to contracting market conditions in a number of our segments  inflationary pressures related to certain raw material costs  including pvc and fuel costs  and an increase in factory variances in due primarily to labor inefficiencies 
selling  engineering  general and administrative we incurred total selling  engineering  general and administrative seg a expense of million in compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase reflects the impact of the addition of copperfield  which accounted for million of the increase  increased stock compensation expense which accounted for million of the total increase excluding copperfield related options given that includes a full year of expense recorded for our stock option plan  which was established in october  and an aggregate increase of million across a number of other corporate expenses  most notably professional fees and payroll and related costs 
as a percentage of net sales  seg a expense was in  as compared to in  reflecting the impact of increased expense leverage as our fixed costs were spread over a higher net sales base 
intangible amortization expense we recorded million in amortization expense in primarily related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the copperfield acquisition 
as copperfield was acquired in april of  intangible amortization expense recorded for reflects approximately nine month s of expense 
accordingly  we expect increased intangible amortization expense for  as set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were recorded in compared to million in these expenses were incurred in connection with the integration of copperfield in million  and the closure of our miami lakes and siler city facilities in million  million 
all actions associated with the closure of the miami lakes and siler city facilities have been substantially completed as of december  see further detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net we incurred million in net interest expense in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility during  as compared to  and the million of notes issued during april of the current year 
we increased our total debt level significantly during to fund our acquisition activities  as further detailed below in the liquidity and capital resources section 
other income loss  net other loss  net  for included million for estimated costs pursuant to the tax matters agreement 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in compared to million for the year ended december  income tax expense increased due to a change from s corporation status to c corporation status in october  resulting in increased tax expense 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was due primarily to price increases driven by the significant increase in the cost of raw materials  primarily copper  for compared to there was a decline in volume in due to decreased demand from existing customers  somewhat offset by the addition of new customers 
also contributing to the volume decline was a shift in the product mix in our consumer outlets segment from higher weight products  such as extension cords  to lower weight products  such as data  thermostat and coaxial cables and a change in manufacturing process in our automotive channel 
otherwise  product mix in units for these periods was relatively consistent 
volume changes between comparative years are measured in total pounds shipped 

table of contents gross profit gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the gross profit margin was due in part to the ability to secure pricing increases sooner than increased copper and other raw material cost increases were reflected in inventory and cost of goods sold 
in addition  gross profit increases were due to reduced costs due to manufacturing efficiency improvements  the ability to reduce shipping and other distribution expenses  and to spread fixed costs over a significantly higher revenue base 
selling  engineering  general and administrative seg a expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase between the two periods resulted primarily from increased sales commissions due to a higher revenue base  an increase in the accrual of management bonuses due to improved profitability  increased depreciation expense  and an increase in professional fees paid to a director for services rendered in connection with the exploration and development of strategic alternatives and certain other matters 
restructuring charges restructuring charges for the year ended december  were million 
these expenses were the result of the planned closures of our miami lakes and siler city facilities 
restructuring charges included million of employee severance costs  million of lease termination costs  million of equipment relocation costs and million of other closing costs 
interest expense  net and loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense  net was million for year ended december   compared to million of interest expense  net for year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average borrowings under our revolving line of credit resulting primarily from increased inventory costs 
other income loss  net other loss  net  for the year ended december  included million for estimated costs accrued pursuant to the tax matters agreement compared to million of income for the year ended december  which was due to the sale of zero coupon bonds in may  in connection with the settlement of the copperweld corporation capital lease obligation 
income tax expense income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  income tax expense increased primarily because of a change from s corporation status to c corporation status in october  resulting in increased corporation tax expense

the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part i  item of this document 
electrical wire and cable distributors in  net sales declined million  or  compared to  primarily reflecting reduced demand from existing customers and pricing pressures resulting from contracting market conditions 
our volume declined in  most notably in the residential construction markets  partially offset by increases in the maintenance  repair and overhaul mro  industrial and commercial construction markets 
as in  volume declined in  down as compared to  largely as a function of declines in the residential construction market  as well as declines in energy related markets  however  net sales increased in  as compared to  as the impact of volume declines in was offset by our ability to increase selling prices during that year in the face of increased raw material costs  as well as by the addition of new customers 
operating income was million in compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was a function of the negative gross profit impact of pricing pressures due to lower market demand  the costs of plant realignments and plant variances  lower overall sales volume  and increased stock compensation expense 
the increase in operating income in  as compared to  was attributable to our ability to secure price increases to offset increases in raw material costs  reduce shipping and other distribution expenses  and the ability to spread fixed costs across a larger revenue base 
specialty distributors and oems in  net sales increased million  or  compared to volume declined due to decreased demand from our existing customers  offset by growth and market share gains in our oem government and industrial channels 
as in  volume declined in  down as compared to  largely as a function of overall market conditions  offset by increases in the security home automation  irrigation and copper fabrication channels due to market share gains 
operating income was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease primarily reflects the negative operating profit impact of the same factors as set forth above relative to our decline in operating profit within the electrical wire and cable distributors segment 
the increase in operating income in  as compared to  primarily reflects volume and price initiatives  improved manufacturing efficiencies  reduced shipping and other distribution expenses  and the spreading of fixed costs over a larger revenue base 

table of contents consumer outlets in  net sales increased million  or  compared to the increase reflects to largely an equivalent degree  the impact of adding approximately one month s sales for woods in  and increases in our base business  driven primarily by volume increases and price increases associated with raw material cost increases 
our volume in this segment increased  excluding the impact of acquisitions 
the volume increase was primarily due to an increase of automotive product sales due to improved market conditions compared to and to initial stocking orders for product line extensions with existing customers in in  net sales declined million  or  compared to  as volumes declined  reflecting lower demand from existing customers as a result of soft year end sales  partially offset by price increases 
operating income was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was largely due to strength in demand in our automotive channel  expanded product placement with existing customers  the ability to spread fixed costs across a larger revenue base  the impact of current year acquisitions  improved operational efficiencies due to plant realignments in and the ability to secure price increases to offset the impact of increased raw material costs 
the favorable impact of these items was partially offset by increased advertising expense due to new customer promotions  increased commission expense due to higher revenues  stock compensation expense and the accrual of management bonuses due to increased profitability 
operating income declined million to million in  as compared to million in the impact of lower sales volume was offset by increased sales prices  gains on the sale of commodity contracts  reduced shipping and other distribution expenses  cost savings realized from our miami facility closure  and manufacturing process improvements 
copperfield no comparison is presented for copperfield because it was not included in our financial results in operating income for copperfield is reduced by an increase in depreciation expense of million and the amortization of intangible assets of million due to purchase price allocations 
liquidity and capital resources our financial position during was significantly impacted by the following events acquisition of copperfield and woods including acquisition related costs and working capital adjustments subject to finalization for woods  we paid million for of the outstanding equity interests of copperfield  and million for certain assets of woods us and all the stock of woods canada 
these acquisitions significantly increased the scale of our operations and our outstanding debt levels  issuance of million in senior notes we issued million aggregate principal of senior notes defined below in connection with financing the copperfield acquisition in april of  thereby increasing the total outstanding principal of senior notes to million at december   amended million revolving credit facility in april  also in connection with the copperfield acquisition  our five year revolving credit facility was amended and restated  thereby increasing our total borrowing capacity under the facility up to a maximum of million 
we also borrowed against the facility to fund our acquisition of woods  resulting in outstanding borrowings under the facility of million at december  
table of contents debt our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations was as follows as of december  in thousands revolving credit facility expiring april  senior notes due october   including unamortized premium of  and  respectively capital lease obligations other debt total debt revolving credit facility our five year revolving credit facility is a senior secured facility that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million  subject to certain limitations 
the proceeds from the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including merger and acquisition activity 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum of million in excess availability under the facility at all times 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and an advance rate to be determined of certain appraised fixed assets  with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
at december   we had million in remaining excess availability 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries on a joint and several basis  either as a co borrower of the company or a guarantor  and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries  including accounts receivable  inventory and any other tangible and intangible assets including real estate  machinery and equipment and intellectual property  as well as by a pledge of all the capital stock of each of our domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains financial and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to pay dividends or distributions  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  make investments  provide guarantees  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  enter into leases or sale and lease back transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we are also prohibited from making prepayments on the senior notes  except for scheduled payments required pursuant to the terms of such senior notes 
in addition to maintaining a minimum of million in excess availability under the facility at all times  the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to for any month during which our excess availability under the revolving credit facility falls below million 
we maintained greater than million of monthly excess availability in on november   the revolving credit facility was amended to allow for our acquisition of woods 
the amendment also permitted us to make future investments in our canadian subsidiaries in an aggregate amount  together with the investment made to acquire woods canada  not to exceed million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our revolving credit facility 
senior notes at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding  all of which mature on october  the senior notes 
as noted above  the senior notes include the million aggregate principal amount of notes issued in connection with our acquisition of copperfield 
the notes are governed by the same indenture the indenture and have substantially the same terms and conditions as our million aggregate principal of senior notes issued in the notes 

table of contents the indenture includes a covenant that prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  including but not limited to the maximum availability under our revolving credit facility  unless our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants for our senior notes 
current and future liquidity in general  we require cash for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment and interest 
our working capital requirements tend to increase when we experience significant demand for products or significant copper price increases 
our management assesses the future cash needs of our business by considering a number of factors  including historical earnings and cash flow performance  future working capital needs  current and projected debt service expenses  planned capital expenditures  and our ability to borrow additional funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
based on the foregoing  we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
if we experience a deficiency in earnings with respect to our fixed charges in the future  we would need to fund the fixed charges through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if cash flows generated from our operations  together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  are not sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and capital expenditures and we need to seek additional sources of capital  the limitations on our ability to incur debt contained in the revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes could prevent us from securing additional capital through the issuance of debt 
in that case  we would need to secure additional capital through other means  such as the issuance of equity 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we were not able to secure additional capital  we could be required to delay or forego capital spending or other corporate initiatives  such as the development of products  or acquisition opportunities

the million net decrease in cash used for working capital was attributable to changes in a number of working capital items  most notably inventories  reflecting better inventory management and economies of scale as a result of the closure of certain facilities in  partially offset by lower accounts payable  due to a difference in timing of payments 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in  respectively  with the increase primarily attributable to the acquisition of copperfield and woods 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in the million in cash provided from financing activities in was primarily a function of acquisition related borrowing activities 
as noted above  during we issued million in senior notes  generating total proceeds of million net of issuance costs  and increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which were million at december   as compared to million at december  for  we used million in net cash  primarily reflecting the repayment of million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in other long term debt repayments  the repurchase of million of our common shares in connection with our private placement  and million in dividends paid to our s corporation shareholders  partially offset by million in net proceeds generated from the private placement 
integration activities related to copperfield and woods in november  our board of directors approved management s integration strategy for copperfield which involves the streamlining of copperfield s manufacturing operations and cost reductions related to the elimination of overlap between coleman and copperfield 
the integration plan includes the consolidation and closure of copperfield manufacturing and distribution facilities located in avilla  indiana  nogales  arizona  and el paso  texas  into operations at one modern facility in el paso  texas 
we estimate that these measures will result in net cash expenditures of approximately million to million in depending on various factors including the timing of the sale of two of our owned facilities involved in the integration plan and the amount of proceeds received 
we expect the majority of these integration activities to be complete by the end of in january  we announced plans to consolidate three of our existing distribution facilities located in indianapolis  indiana  gurnee  illinois  and waukegan  illinois into a single leased distribution facility in pleasant prairie  wisconsin 
we expect the new facility to be in operation and the closures of the effected facilities to be largely completed by the end of second quarter of the indianapolis facility  acquired in connection with the woods acquisition  will be closed in advance of its scheduled lease termination date  whereas we expect to utilize the remaining two leased facilities in our operations through their remaining lease terms  which end in we expect to incur total costs between approximately million and million as a result of the above described plan 
the majority of the cash expenditures are expected to be treated as a purchase accounting adjustment to be recorded in  with the remainder accounted for as restructuring or operating expense in seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in net sales and cash flow 
larger amounts of cash are generally required during the second and third quarters of the year to build inventories in 
table of contents anticipation of higher demand during the late fall and early winter months 
in general  receivables related to higher sales activities during the late fall and early winter months are collected during the late fourth and early first quarter of the year 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including current portion and interest capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest obligations includes interest on our variable rate debt  primarily borrowings under the revolving credit facility  calculated based on interest rates at december  amounts of future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings will depend on prevailing variable interest rates in future periods and the amount of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility depending upon our working capital requirements 
we will also be required to make future cash contributions to our defined contribution savings plans 
the estimate for these contributions is approximately million during estimates of cash contributions to be made after are difficult to determine due to the number of variable factors that impact the calculation of defined contribution savings plans 
purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders and other contractual arrangements for inventory and raw materials 
we anticipate being able to meet our obligations as they come due 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of our products when the products are shipped to customers and title passes to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale 
we record customer promotional allowances as a reduction of net sales when it is probable that the allowance will be granted and the amount of the allowance can be reasonably estimated 
our promotional allowances are primarily related to the volumes of purchases by various customer groups during specified time periods 
accordingly  to calculate our ultimate related promotional costs  we estimate during each period each customer s potential for achieving the related purchase volumes based primarily on our sales history with each customer 
subsequent period changes in our estimates have not been material in the prior three years 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect management s best estimate of losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date 
in calculating the allowance for uncollectible accounts  we consider both the current financial condition of individual customers and historical write off patterns 
inventories inventories include material  labor and overhead costs and are recorded at the lower of cost or market on the fifo basis 
in applying fifo  we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition or where inventory cost exceeds net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
plant and equipment plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from three to twenty years  using principally the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carry amount of those assets to determine if write down is appropriate 
if we identify impairment  we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill  but goodwill is subject to our annual impairment testing at december potential impairment exists if the carrying amount of net assets of an operating segment  including goodwill  is greater than the fair value of net assets of an operating segment 
to the extent possible  we identify specific net assets at the operating segment level 
net assets such as inventory  fixed assets and accounts payable are allocated to each operating segment for purposes of recognizing and measuring goodwill impairment 
allocations are based on manufactured cost of goods sold by operating segment 
goodwill was allocated to each operating segment based on the relative fair value of each operating segment 
fair value was based on the income approach using a calculation of discounted estimated future cash flows from our annual long range planning process 
the calculation of impairment loss compares the implied fair value of each operating segment s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
various factors  including a deterioration in the future prospects for any of our operating segments or a decision to exit an operating segment  could result in impairment charges 
income taxes through october   we conducted our business as an s corporation  with the exception of our wholly owned c corporation subsidiary  for federal and state income tax purposes 
accordingly  our shareholders had been responsible for federal and substantially all state income tax liabilities arising out of our operations 
for all periods prior to the c corporation conversion  dividends had been paid to shareholders at amounts that approximated the shareholders current tax liability arising from their ownership in the company 
as of october   the day before we consummated the private placement  we ceased to be an s corporation and became a c corporation and  as such  we became subject to federal and state income taxes 
the unaudited pro forma statements of operations data included elsewhere in this report present our pro forma provision for income taxes and net income as if we had 
table of contents been a c corporation for all periods presented 
for further information reference selected consolidated financial data 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
a provision for income tax expense is recognized for income taxes payable for the current period  plus the net changes in deferred tax amounts 
we periodically assess the reliability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state or federal statutory tax audits 
the internal revenue service is currently examining our  and federal income tax returns 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of this examination will not result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  cash flow or results of operations

this statement amends arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
upon its adoption  effective as of the beginning of  noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the consolidated financial statements and income and comprehensive income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in income and comprehensive income 
the provisions of this standard must be applied retrospectively upon adoption 
we do not currently have any minority interest components at any of our subsidiaries  and we do not anticipate the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices  primarily copper prices  and interest rates on borrowings 
commodity risk 
certain raw materials used in our products are subject to price volatility  most notably copper  which is the primary raw material used in our products 
the price of copper is particularly volatile and can affect our net sales and profitability 
we purchase copper at prevailing market prices and  through multiple pricing strategies  generally attempt to pass along to our customers changes in the price of copper and other raw materials 
from time to time  we enter into derivatives  including copper futures contracts  to mitigate the potential impact of fluctuations in the price of copper on our pricing terms with certain customers 
we do not speculate on copper prices 
we record these derivative contracts at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability  and record changes in the fair value of such contracts within cost of goods sold as they occur 
at december   we had contracts with an aggregate fair value of million to sell  pounds of copper in march a hypothetical adverse movement of in the price of copper at december   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a loss in the fair value of our commodity futures contracts of approximately million as of december  interest rate risk 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of our debt obligations 
as of december   approximately of our debt was variable rate  primarily our borrowings under our revolving credit facility for which interest costs are based on either the lenders prime rate or libor 
based on the amount of our variable rate borrowings at december   which totaled approximately million  an immediate one percentage point change in libor would change our annual interest expense by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the amount of variable rate borrowings remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period
