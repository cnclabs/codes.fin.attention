table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that is creating a pipeline of novel protein therapeutic product candidates to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cancer 
our mission is to develop a variety of first in class and best in class product candidates customized for optimal safety  efficacy  and convenience that we believe may offer improved patient experiences 
our current product candidates are novel small modular immunopharmaceutical  or smip tm  therapeutics  and are designed using our custom drug assembly technology 
our lead product candidate  tru  has completed a phase b clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  or ra 
we and our partner  wyeth  have agreed on the design of the next clinical trial and patient dosing is expected to begin in the first half of the randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center trial will examine ways to further optimize efficacy while evaluating dosing schedule options 
we believe this study has been designed in a way that could be supportive of a registration package 
in addition  we and our partner wyeth are also developing tru for the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  systemic lupus erythematosus  or sle  and other undisclosed indications 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development and worldwide commercialization of certain therapeutics  including tru our proprietary product candidate  tru  is a novel cd targeted therapy for the treatment of b cell malignancies  such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  and nhl 
tru uses a different mechanism of action than cd directed therapies 
as a result  we believe its novel design may provide patients with improved therapeutic options and enhance efficacy when used alone or in combination with chemotherapy and or other cd directed therapeutics 
we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  for our tru product candidate for the treatment of b cell malignancies in the fourth quarter of and we expect to begin patient dosing in the first half of we were founded as a limited liability company in the state of washington in march  and operated as a development stage company 
we reincorporated in the state of delaware in october to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  strategic alliances  equipment financings  and government grants 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with wyeth for the development and worldwide commercialization of tru and other therapeutics directed to cd we are also collaborating with wyeth on the development and worldwide commercialization of certain other smip tm product candidates directed to a small number of targets other than cd that have been established pursuant to the agreement 
during the remaining term of our research and development services for wyeth  wyeth has the right to replace a limited number of these targets  which replacement targets are subject to our consent  which we may not unreasonably withhold 
in addition  we also have the option to co promote with wyeth  on customary terms to be agreed  cd directed therapies in the united states for niche indications 
we retain the right to develop and commercialize  on our own or with others  smip tm product candidates directed to all targets not included within the agreement  including cd unless earlier terminated  our agreement with wyeth will remain in effect on a product by product basis and on a country by country basis until the later of the date that any such product shall no longer be covered by a valid claim of a united states or foreign patent or application and  generally  years after the first commercial sale of any product licensed under the agreement 

table of contents in connection with the agreement  wyeth paid us a million non refundable  non creditable  up front fee in january and purchased directly from us in a private placement  concurrent with our initial public offering   shares of our common stock at the initial public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
the agreement provides that we are to provide research and development services for the three year period ending december  with the option for wyeth to extend the service period for two additional one year periods 
wyeth s financial obligations to us also include collaborative research funding commitments of up to million in exchange for a commitment by us to provide an agreed upon number of full time employees per year to provide services in furtherance of the research program  which amount is subject to an increase if such program is extended as well as annual increases pursuant to percentage changes in the cpi 
wyeth s financial obligations include additional amounts for reimbursement of agreed upon external research and development costs and patent costs 
wyeth is also obligated to make payments of up to million based on the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones for cd directed therapies and payments of up to million based on the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones for therapies directed to the small number of targets other than cd that have been established pursuant to the agreement 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments on future licensed product sales 
as of december   wyeth may terminate the agreement without cause at any time upon days prior written notice 
in july  we completed our phase b clinical trial of tru for the treatment of ra 
in november  we announced the presentation of positive data from a phase b trial that showed that our tru provided statistically significant efficacy for treating ra after a single infusion of mg or mg 
in addition  we also announced presentation of data showing that repeat administration with tru was well tolerated and resulted in a consistent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile 
we also announced that we and wyeth have agreed on the design of the next clinical trial  and patient dosing is expected to begin in the first half of the randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center trial will examine ways to further optimize efficacy while evaluating dosing schedule options 
additional study protocol details will be provided after commencement of patient dosing 
we believe this study has been designed in a way that could be supportive of a registration package 
assuming this product candidate continues to progress in development  expenses for future clinical trials may be higher than those incurred in prior clinical trials 
these expenses will  however  likely be incurred by wyeth and expenses incurred by us  if any  will be substantially offset by reimbursement revenue from wyeth 
in addition  wyeth is responsible for a substantial portion of costs related to patent prosecution and patent litigation  if any  for products directed to targets selected by wyeth pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
in addition to our current product candidates  we are also developing additional alliance and proprietary product candidates that build on our product experience 
the continued research and development of our product candidates will require significant additional expenditures  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing costs  and the expenses of seeking regulatory approval 
we rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our preclinical studies  all of our clinical trials and all of the manufacturing of cgmp material 
we expect expenditures associated with these activities to increase in future years as we continue developing our product candidates 
expenditures associated with our product candidates included in the wyeth collaboration will be substantially offset by reimbursement revenue from wyeth 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized net losses of million and million  respectively 
we expect our net losses to increase as we continue our existing preclinical studies  manufacturing  and clinical trials and expand our research and development efforts 
in addition  revenue may decrease in the future due to the successful transfer of the majority of clinical development efforts and related costs to wyeth  resulting in a decline in the associated collaborative research revenue  and a decline in revenue associated with the amortization of the up front fee over a longer service period 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited financial statements for the year ended december  in this annual report on form k 
of our significant accounting policies  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  preclinical study and clinical trial accruals  and stock based compensation are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values when there is reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
if separable  the applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied to each of the separate units 
for combined units of accounting  the revenue is generally recognized in the same manner as the final deliverable 
generally  revenue related to licensing activity and our research and development services under collaboration agreements is recognized ratably over the estimated term of the research and development service period 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when earned 
we recognize revenue from our collaboration agreement with wyeth  which consists of non refundable  non creditable up front fees and license fees  collaborative research funding  regulatory and sales milestones  and future product royalties 
revenue related to the wyeth collaboration is recognized as follows up front fees and license fees non refundable  non creditable up front fees and license fees received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the research and development service period 
the estimated term of the research and development service period is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
we also consider the time frame of our substantive contractual obligations related to research and development agreements when estimating the term of the research and development period 
revenue may fluctuate in the future due to adjustments to the estimated term of the research and development service period 
collaborative research funding certain internal and external research and development costs and patent costs are reimbursed in connection with collaboration agreements 
reimbursed costs are recognized as revenue in the same period the costs were incurred 

table of contents milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria will be recognized in full at such time as the specified milestone has been achieved according to the terms of the agreement 
when payments are not for substantive and at risk milestones  revenue will be recognized immediately for the proportionate amount of the payment that correlates to services that have already been rendered  with the balance recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated term of the research and development service period 
the basis of the research and development service period is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
royalties royalties that are based on reported sales of licensed products and revenues will be calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing accruals we estimate our preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing accrued expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct  manage  and provide materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
our research and development costs are expensed as incurred or at the date payment of non refundable fees and milestone payments become due  whichever occurs first 
preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to clinical research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses based on the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are included in research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs of setting up a preclinical study or clinical trial are expensed immediately 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research organizations 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may  however  underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial expenses 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks  and may change depending on a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
if any of our product candidates enter phase clinical trials  the process of estimating clinical trial costs will become more difficult because the trials will involve larger numbers of patients and clinical sites 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all future share based payments made to employees and directors be based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting for employee stock options using the minimum value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees   fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb  and related interpretations  and the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based 
table of contents compensation transition and disclosure 
compensation costs for employee stock options granted prior to january  were accounted for using the option s intrinsic value or the difference  if any  between the fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price of the option 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method  under which compensation costs recognized during the years ended december  and december  include a compensation costs for all share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the intrinsic value in accordance with the original provisions of apb and b compensation costs for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
total employee stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we make assumptions with respect to the expected life of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates  and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
we have assumed that non employee stock options have an expected life of one to ten years and assumed common stock volatility between and 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the period of expected service by the non employee 
as the service is performed  we are required to update these assumptions and periodically revalue unvested options and make adjustments to the stock based compensation expense using the new valuation 
these adjustments may result in higher or lower stock based compensation expense in the statement of operations than originally estimated or recorded 
ultimately  the final compensation charge for each option grant to non employees is unknown until those options have vested or the performance of services is completed 
stock based compensation expense associated with these non employee options was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect stock based compensation expense associated with non employee options to fluctuate in the future based on the volatility of our future stock price 
valuation of investments we carry our investments of debt securities at fair value  estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
in accordance with our investment policy  we diversify our credit risk and invest in debt securities with high credit quality 
substantially all of our investments held as of december  are actively traded and our estimate of fair value is based upon quoted market prices 
to date  the carrying values of our investments have not been written down due to declines in value because such declines are judged to be other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
we will continue to monitor our credit risks and evaluate the potential need for impairment charges related to credit risks in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in september fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  but do not believe the impact of the adoption will be material 
in february sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas was issued 
sfas permits companies 
table of contents to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact this standard would have on our financial statements  but do not believe the impact of the adoption will be material 
in june the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  ratified emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf the scope of eitf is limited to nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities 
this issue provides that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
we intend to adopt eitf issue effective january  the impact of applying this consensus will depend on the terms of our future research and development contractual arrangements entered into on or after december  in november  the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  or eitf eitf will require us to disclose the nature and purpose of our collaborative arrangements in our annual financial statements  our rights and obligations under the collaborative arrangements  the stage of the underlying endeavors life cycle  our accounting policies for the arrangements and the income statement classification and amount of significant financial statement amounts related to the collaborative arrangements 
eitf will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will require us to apply it as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are currently assessing the impact of eitf on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
results of operations for the years ended december    and revenue 
revenue decreased to million in from million in revenue increased to million in from  in the decrease in was due to decreased milestone revenue  with million of milestone revenue recognized in and none in  reduced reimbursement revenue from the wyeth collaboration as a result of the successful transfer of manufacturing activities for tru from us to wyeth in  and decreased revenue related to an extension of the recognition period for the up front fee 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in reimbursable clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru revenue for the year ended december  was comprised of million for collaborative research funding and million for amortization of the million up front fee 
the million up front fee is being deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the research and development service period 
during the third quarter of  the estimated term of the research and development service period was adjusted from five years to six years and three months 
the change in the estimated research and development service period was primarily due to a change in the estimated service period for our obligations to conduct clinical activities under our agreement with wyeth 
this change in estimate reduced recognition of the up front fee during by million 
revenue is expected to decrease in the future due to the revised recognition period for the up front fee 
our actual revenue  however  could differ materially from anticipated revenue 
the increase in revenue in compared to was due to the wyeth collaboration  which was executed in december revenue in the year ended december  was comprised of million for collaborative research funding  million for amortization of the million up front fee and million for a milestone payment 

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru  increased personnel related expenses due to increased headcount  increased outside manufacturing costs related to our tru product candidate  increased lab supplies to support our research activities and increased facilities costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower outside manufacturing costs for tru due to the successful transfer of manufacturing activities to wyeth in the first quarter of and lower non cash stock based compensation charges 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased manufacturing costs to support clinical trials for tru  our lead product candidate  increased personnel related expenses  increased clinical trial costs related to tru  increased non cash stock based compensation charges and an increase in lab supplies to support our research activities 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future due to increased manufacturing and clinical development costs primarily related to our tru product candidate  as well as the related expansion of our research and development organization  advancement of our preclinical programs  and product candidate manufacturing costs 
at any time  we have many ongoing research projects 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are developing each of our product candidates in parallel for multiple disease indications  and through our basic research activities  we are seeking to design potential drug candidates for multiple new disease indications 
due to the number of ongoing projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  we do not record or maintain information regarding the costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
in addition  we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs 
the costs associated with research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs approximate the following in thousands year ended december  research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development research and preclinical program costs consist of costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  personnel costs  animal studies  lab supplies and indirect costs such as rent  utilities and depreciation 
research and preclinical program costs increased in compared to due to increased personnel related expenses due to increased headcount  increased lab supplies to support our research activities and increased facilities costs 
clinical development costs consist of clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial site and investigator fees  personnel costs and indirect costs such as rent  utilities and depreciation 
clinical development program costs decreased in compared to due to decreased outside manufacturing costs resulting from the successful transfer of manufacturing activities for tru to wyeth in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by higher clinical costs related to our phase b clinical trial for tru and outside manufacturing costs related to our tru program 
the majority of our research and development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
product candidates may be found to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of 
table of contents our product candidates and it is uncertain which of our product candidates may be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
under our collaboration with wyeth  we are responsible for completing the phase a and b clinical trials of tru for ra 
in addition  we are responsible for conducting clinical studies for tru niche indications 
while we are currently focused on developing tru and other smip tm product candidates with wyeth and our tru product candidate  together with other smip tm product candidates that are outside of the collaboration  we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we anticipate developing additional product candidates  which will also increase our research and development expenses in future periods 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available in major markets before  if at all 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses  increased consulting and outside service fees incurred in support of being a publicly traded company and increased fees related to filings for the protection of our intellectual property offset by decreased non cash stock based compensation expenses 
the increase was primarily due to increased non cash stock based compensation charges  an increase in fees related to filings for the protection of our intellectual property and increased personnel related expenses incurred in anticipation of the requirements of operating as a publicly traded company 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively stable in our actual general and administrative expenses  however  could differ materially from those anticipated 
net interest income 
net interest income increased to million in compared to million in and  in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average cash balance in compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in our average cash balance in compared to the increases in our average cash balances in and were due to the net proceeds of our initial public offering and concurrent private placement to wyeth in october and payments received throughout and under our wyeth collaboration 
we expect net interest income to decrease in the future as a result of a declining cash balance 
income taxes we were founded as a limited liability company in the state of washington in march we reincorporated in the state of delaware in october since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire between and liquidity and capital resources from inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  receiving aggregate net proceeds from such sales totaling million through december  
table of contents in january  we received payment of a million up front fee in connection with our collaboration agreement with wyeth 
in october  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
we also received proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in the concurrent private placement to wyeth 
we have received additional funding from asset based lease financings and interest earned on investments 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and a million receivable from wyeth for collaborative research funding 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  high credit rating corporate borrowers and money market accounts 
we have no exposure to auction rate securities within our investment portfolio 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in operations during was primarily due to personnel related costs  clinical trial costs  legal and professional fees  lab supplies to support our research activities  outside manufacturing costs  facilities costs and administrative costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded company 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to the million up front fee received from wyeth in january  partially offset by operating costs 
we expect net cash used in operating expenses to increase in as we continue to expand our research and clinical activities 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  investing activities consist primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities and capital purchases 
purchases of property and equipment were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment in as we expand our operations  however  to a lesser extent than in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from an equipment financing arrangement of million 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds received from our initial public offering of million  net proceeds from our concurrent private placement to wyeth in october of million  as well as net proceeds from an equipment financing arrangement of million 
we entered into a loan and security agreement with comerica bank effective september   the terms of which provide for an million debt facility secured by a security interest in our assets  other than intellectual property 
interest accrues from the date of each equipment advance and is payable monthly 
all equipment advances that were outstanding on september  were payable in equal installments of principal plus all accrued interest  beginning on october  the outstanding balances under the loan bear interest on a monthly basis at a variety of interest rates to be elected by us at the time of each advance  ranging from a floating rate of prime to a fixed rate of  depending on the amount of our deposits with comerica bank 
on july   we and comerica bank modified the loan and security agreement by entering into a first amendment to loan and security agreement  which increased the debt facility by million  for a total debt facility of million 
as of december   we had drawn the full million available on the loan 
the loan and security agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities of this type 
the loan and security agreement could restrict our ability to  among other things  sell certain assets  engage in a merger or change in control transaction  incur debt  pay cash dividends and make investments 
the loan and security agreement also contains events of default that are customary for credit facilities of this type  including payment defaults  covenant defaults  insolvency type defaults  and events of default relating to liens  judgments  material misrepresentations and the 
table of contents occurrence of certain material adverse events 
we are in compliance with the covenants associated with the loan and security agreement 
an interest rate swap was entered into with comerica bank effective november   which fixed the interest rate on the outstanding principal balance of the comerica loan at 
we receive the variable interest rate amount monthly  which is subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the floating rate debt obligation affects earnings 
upon entering into this interest rate swap  which expires in september  we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge by documenting our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge along with methods for assessing the swap s effectiveness 
at december   the notional value of the swap was million and the fair market value of the interest rate swap was valued at approximately  which is included as a non current liability on our balance sheet 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that our existing capital resources  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations for at least the next months 
the key assumptions underlying this estimate include expenditures related to continued preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates during this period will be within budgeted levels  unexpected costs related to the development of our manufacturing capability will not be material  and the hiring of a number of new employees will be at salary levels consistent with our estimates to support our continued growth during this period 
our forecast of the period of time that our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the section of item a entitled risk factors 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with product development 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including milestone payments projected to be received under the wyeth collaboration agreement  the scope  rate of progress  results  and costs of our preclinical testing  clinical trials  and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any additional collaborative or licensing agreements that we may establish  the cost  timing  and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the hiring of a number of new employees will be at salary levels consistent with our estimates to support our continued growth during this period  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity 
table of contents financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily confined to our investment securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
we have no exposure to auction rate securities within our investment portfolio 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and  due to their very short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment securities 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
our principal interest rate exposure is to changes in us interest rates 
instruments with interest rate risk include investment securities and our interest rate swap instrument 
to estimate the potential loss due to changes in interest rates  we performed a sensitivity analysis using the instantaneous adverse change in interest rates of basis points across the yield curve 
on this basis  we estimate the potential loss in fair value that would result from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates to be million as of december
