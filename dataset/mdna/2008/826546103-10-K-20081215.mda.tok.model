the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in the comparable period in fiscal this increase is attributable in part to increased military spending due to ongoing wartime demand such as for additional military helicopters and related replacement components 

table of contents the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in the comparable period in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally due to a million payment to a customer that was made to achieve an amicable settlement related to a product dispute that originated in fiscal  of which million was expensed in fiscal  and that the company agreed to make as a business gesture of good faith and cooperation without admission of liability 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal and were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively 
the remaining million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal was principally due to i a million increase in variable selling cost principally due to the increase in net sales  ii a million increase in compensation and related expenses  and iii a million increase in bad debt expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the acm group recorded million of expense related the impairment of a long lived asset 
the acm group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in the comparable period in fiscal included in the million of operating income in fiscal were the aforementioned million of expenses related to the amicable settlement of a product dispute and the impairment of a long lived asset 
the million of operating income in fiscal  before these million of expenses  reflected an improvement relative to fiscal principally due to the positive impact on margins resulting from higher production and sales volumes in the fiscal  which allowed the acm group to leverage its fixed operating cost structure over more units of production and sales 
the positive impact of the improved leverage of its fixed operating cost were partially offset by the negative impact of i a million increase in the lifo provision and ii higher variable labor costs recognized in fiscal  compared to the same period in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group during fiscal  net sales  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  increased to million  compared with million in the comparable fiscal period 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in the comparable fiscal period 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses during both fiscal and was million of bad debt recoveries and  therefore  the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  during such periods

included in the million operating loss during fiscal were i the aforementioned million of bad debt recovery  ii million of income from the sale of previously reserved inventory  and iii million of income related to the renegotiation of a vendor obligation 
despite these favorable items  the reason that operating results did not improve with the higher volumes during fiscal is due principally to startup costs related to the production launch of a new component repair program and a change in product sales mix to less favorable margin products

the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in the same period in fiscal this million increase in operating income is principally due to i a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses discussed above and ii improved operating margins due to higher sales 
these gains were partially offset by i rising precious metals commodity costs that could not be fully passed on to customers and ii higher compensation expense due to the hiring of additional operations personnel 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in fiscal  compared with million in the same period in fiscal the million increase in fiscal is principally due to an increase in legal and professional expenses related to i the company s long term strategic planning efforts  including its incentive compensation planning  ii its efforts required to achieve initial sarbanes oxley compliance in fiscal  and iii professional tax consulting services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive expense

the company s operating activities provided million of cash of which million was provided by continuing operations in fiscal  compared with million of cash used by operating activities of which million was used for continuing operations in fiscal the million of cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to i million of income from continuing operations before such non cash items as depreciation expense  asset impairment charges  lifo provision and deferred taxes and ii a million decrease in inventory  excluding the million increase in the lifo reserve 
these sources of cash were offset principally by i a million decrease in other long term liabilities  ii a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and iii a million increase in refundable income taxes 
the changes in the components of working capital were due to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i the acm group s response to the increased demand in its business as measured by its sales levels  ii the acm group s efforts to improve the optimization of its inventory levels during such periods of increased demand  iii collections from customers  iv the relative timing of payments to suppliers and v the amount of progress payments made for projected income tax obligations

outlook the company s repair and acm groups businesses continue to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world  while showing improvement  continues to be weak 
the us airline industry has received us government assistance  while some airlines have entered and or proceeded through the bankruptcy reorganization process  and others continue to pursue major restructuring initiatives  which appear to have had a positive impact on operating results in recent periods 
modest improvements in the commercial airlines and the continuation of relatively strong demand in the aircraft and related engine industries have been complemented by relatively strong us military spending for aircraft and related components 
the air transport industry s long term outlook has been one of continued  steady growth 
such outlook suggests the need for additional aircraft and  therefore  growth in the requirement for airframe and engine components as well as aerospace turbine engine repairs 
the air transport industry is currently benefiting from several favorable trends including i projected growth in air traffic  ii major replacement and refurbishment cycles driven by the desire for more fuel efficient aircraft and fleet commonality  and iii the increased use of wide body aircraft 
however  the current global economic crisis has created significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit 
therefore  this crisis may adversely affect the ability of the company s customers and lenders to fulfill their obligations  and a continued deterioration in the global economy could result in reduced demand for the products and services that the company provides 
while management s current outlook for the air transport industry continues to remain favorable in the near term  the company is beginning to see some of its key customers extend delay their required delivery schedules 
it is difficult to determine the potential long term impact that the aforementioned factors may have on air travel and the demand for the products and services provided by the company 
lack of continued improvement could result in credit risk associated with serving the financially troubled airlines and or their suppliers 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they may occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement  and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  and if such excess carrying value is determined to be permanent  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company has a significant amount of property  plant and equipment 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves judgment 
the company believes that its estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the recognition of an impairment charge could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value 
further  actual results can differ significantly from assumptions used by the company in making its estimates 
future changes in the company s estimates could result in future impairment charges 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september   the company s net deferred tax liability before any valuation allowance was million 
at september   the income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis was offset by a valuation allowance of million based on an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
during fiscal  the company reversed a substantial majority of the valuation allowance based on the company s determination that  at that time  it was more likely than not that the benefit would be realized through future taxable income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies the euro  pound sterling and the swedish krona  the payment in local currency of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period and revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  which typically expire within one year 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   the company had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
at september   the company s assets and liabilities denominated in the pound sterling  the euro and swedish krona were as follows amounts in thousands pound sterling euro swedish krona cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities b 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a revolving credit agreement with a us bank 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the september  rate  and assuming no change in the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  annual interest expense to the company would be nominally impacted 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail 
the company is not a party to any hedging or other interest rate risk management agreements
