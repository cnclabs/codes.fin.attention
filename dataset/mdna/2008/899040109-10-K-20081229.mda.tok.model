sales for contract manufacturing decreased compared to a year ago when the sector had the benefit of both stronger retail demand and two simultaneous new product launches 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease in consumer demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was not a factor in fiscal the business imaging segment sales increase was primarily due to a pass through of raw material increases to the segment s customers 
the company depends on two contract manufacturing customers for a significant portion of its business

the decrease in gross profit was due to a decline in toll revenue as it relates to the decrease in net sales mentioned above 
toll revenue is revenue which does not include a pass through of material costs 
the business imaging segment experienced a decrease of million in gross profit and a decrease in margin to from in this decrease was primarily due to rising raw material costs combined with strong price competition 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  in fiscal when compared to the same period in fiscal  consistent with cost increases in general and an increase in sales staffing

as of december  the company expects to spend approximately million to complete the purchase of the canister line and associated packaging equipment 
in business imaging  the amount spent on capital expenditures was  cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  resulting primarily from repayment of outstanding indebtedness 
in february  the company s board of directors approved a program for open market stock repurchases through december  for up to  shares of its common stock at prevailing market prices after concluding that the company s cash and debt position would enable these purchases without impairment to the company s capital 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an extension of its february stock repurchase program through june and an increase in the number of shares from  to  a total of  shares were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of  under the plan through september  as of december   a total of  shares were purchased under the plan for an aggregate purchase price of the company s primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories  accounts receivable  and capital expenditures 
at september   cash recorded on the balance sheet was  the contract manufacturing segment s sales are made pursuant to project specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi year terms 
sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases 
the company has significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and contract manufacturing 
one of these customers  a multinational consumer products company  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the contract with this customer expires in june in fiscal  the company started up two new production lines producing over sku s under a new contract 
this was the single largest and most complex start up ever undertaken by tufco 
this customer accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the contract with this customer expires april the company is currently negotiating an extension to the manufacturing contracts with this customer 
however  because the company s contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements  the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations 
on may   the company entered into a credit agreement 
the credit agreement  as amended  includes a million revolving line of credit facility as well as a million swing line available for overdrafts and expires on may  borrowings under the line of credit are made under the base rate account or the eurodollar account 
interest on amounts borrowed under the base rate account is calculated based on the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus of or the prime rate on the date of the borrowing 
interest on amounts borrowed under the eurodollar account is calculated based on libor 
as of september   the company had million outstanding under the base rate account at a rate of  million outstanding under one eurodollar account at a rate of and million outstanding under a second eurodollar account at a rate of 
the credit agreement also includes a commitment to issue commercial and standby letters of credit not to exceed million 
the company had no amounts outstanding under the letter of credit commitment as of september  the company had million available under the line of credit as of september  the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including requirements to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  after tax net income and restrictions liquidity and capital resources continued on maximum allowable debt  stock purchases  mergers  and payment of dividends 
at september   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement 
on december   the company had approximately million available under its revolving credit and swing lines 
consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed  amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent and of total accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s operating cash flow  together with amounts available under its credit agreement  are adequate to service the company s long term obligations as of september  and any budgeted capital expenditures  assuming the company meets its business plan 
the company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future 
in addition  pursuant to the credit agreement  the company s primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over million 
inflation in fiscal years and  the impact of inflation was minimal on the company s inventory and net income 
management believes that the company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the company s products  although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases 
prior to these periods  the impact of inflation has been minimal on the company s inventory and net income 
credit environment the credit markets continue to be volatile and experience liquidity shortages due to the instability in the lending industry and overall downturn in the economy 
the company does not engage in any business activities in the lending industry 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity under its credit agreement at variable interest rates and from cash provided by operations 
sales are concentrated in the consumer staples markets  which are generally considered more stable during uncertain times 
however  if these customers continue to curb investment in more discretionary products as a result of the decline in economic conditions  it is possible revenues could decline further 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of operations for the company 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales 
accounts receivable management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues 
management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
a large portion of the company s inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
in order to calculate goodwill  management applies judgment in determining the reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the business 
the annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss 
calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or any changes in market conditions  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques  including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment for disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the critical accounting policies continued recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques
