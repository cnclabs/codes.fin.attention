item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview imation is a leading provider of removable data storage media products designed to help our customers capture  create  protect  preserve and retrieve valuable digital assets 
our data storage products are sold in approximately countries to commercial organizations and individual consumers 
our commercial customers range from managers of large data centers to distributed network administrators to small business owners who rely on our tape cartridges for data processing  security  business continuity  backup and archiving applications 
our commercial and consumer customers rely on our recordable optical discs  usb flash drives  flash cards  removable hard drives and audio and video tape to store  edit and manage data  photos  video  images and music 
we also sell a range of consumer video  audio and home electronic products through retailers in north america 
the data storage market presents attractive growth opportunities as well as challenges 
demand for removable data storage capacity is growing rapidly 
new formats deliver greater capacity in a single piece of storage media  which results in overall revenue growth being lower than the overall growth in demand for storage capacity 
the market is highly competitive  may be subject to consolidation and is characterized by continuing changes in technology  ongoing variable price erosion  diverse distribution channels and a large variety of brands and formats for tape  optical  flash and removable hard disk products 
in  we entered into the consumer electronics market with our electronic products segment 
the consumer electronics and accessories markets provide growth opportunities to extend our various brands across multiple product categories 
we deliver a broad portfolio of products across multiple brands through diverse distribution channels and geographies 
we manufacture the majority of our magnetic tape products and source the majority of our other products 
success in the market is dependent on several factors  including being early to market with new formats and products  having efficient manufacturing  sourcing  logistics and supply chain operations  working closely with leading oems to develop new formats or enhancements to existing formats  offering a broad assortment of products  having broad geographic and market coverage and managing a portfolio of strong brands across diverse regions  distribution channels and product categories 
our strategy  as stated in our may  analyst presentation  is to optimize our magnetic tape business  to grow our consumer business and to extend our brands into new areas such as audio video consumer electronic products and accessory products 
this strategy provides significant growth opportunities for us  however  the consumer markets are subject to greater volatility in pricing and are more difficult to predict than the commercial data storage tape market in which we have historically operated 
specifically to our strategy  we are optimizing our position in magnetic tape as we continue to invest in both technology and manufacturing of current and future tape formats 
we are growing our consumer products portfolio across multiple brands and extending brands selectively into the audio video consumer electronics arena 

table of contents lastly  with our recent acquisitions and other strategic actions  we are building a portfolio of brands that we own  manage or distribute in both consumer retail and commercial markets 
our plan is to grow revenue organically  through distribution agreements and other strategic actions  and also through strategic mergers and acquisitions 
we will do this without adding significant additional infrastructure 
we continually evaluate operating expense and structure based on what is affordable under our expected business results  thus maintaining a relatively flat and efficient organizational structure 
in further support of implementing an efficient operating model  we continue to implement lean enterprise principles that emphasize speed  quality and competitive cost across all key functions and processes 
we believe this strategy  over the longer term  can deliver increased gross margin dollars and operating profit growth on increased revenue as well as a return on capital employed above our weighted average cost of capital 
factors affecting comparability of our financial results acquisitions on july   we acquired the tdk recording media business 
on july   we acquired the memcorp business

segment results we operate in two markets  selling removable data storage media and accessories for use in the personal storage  network and enterprise data center markets and selling consumer electronic products and accessories 
we completed the memcorp acquisition and entered into the consumer electronics market during the third quarter of our data storage media business is organized  managed and internally and externally reported as segments differentiated by the regional markets we serve americas  europe and asia pacific 
each of these segments has responsibility for selling virtually all imation product lines except for consumer electronic products 
consumer electronics are sold through our new electronic products ep segment 
the ep segment is currently focused primarily in north america and primarily under the memorex brand name 
we evaluate segment performance based on net revenue and operating income 
net revenue for each segment is generally based on customer location where the product is shipped 
the operating income reported in our segments excludes corporate and other unallocated amounts 

table of contents although such amounts are excluded from the business segment results  they are included in reported consolidated earnings 
corporate and unallocated amounts include research and development expense  corporate expense  stock based compensation expense  restructuring and other expenses and a non cash goodwill impairment charge which are not allocated to the segments

in late  we paid million to enter into a tape media distribution agreement with exabyte whereby we became the exclusive distributor of exabyte media including the vxa class of tape cartridges 
this transaction resulted in an intangible asset of million 
on october   we amended certain terms of the exabyte distribution agreement whereby we agreed to lower the margin we earn on distribution in exchange for consideration of million in the form of exabyte common stock  preferred stock and warrants collectively  stock holdings and notes receivable with a corresponding offset to the original intangible asset recorded in conjunction with the execution of the original exabyte distribution agreement 
due to the decline in value of exabyte common stock  we determined that other than temporary impairments in our investment in exabyte holdings existed in consequently  we reduced the carrying value of our exabyte holdings by million with a corresponding loss recorded in other expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our exabyte stock holdings had been fully written off 
the exabyte notes receivable consist of a million note  bearing percent interest beginning january   with interest only payments through and quarterly principal and interest payments commencing on march  and continuing through december  the notes receivable also included a million note bearing percent interest through december   at which time the principal amount was due 
on november   tandberg completed the acquisition of substantially all of the exabyte assets and the exabyte tape media distribution agreement was assigned to tandberg 
as a result of the acquisition  we restructured the exabyte notes receivable agreement 
in connection with the notes restructuring agreement  we received million of the million previously due december   and all interest accrued but not paid  on the outstanding notes receivable 
tandberg replaced the million note with a million note the note 
the note bears interest at percent beginning november   payable quarterly with principal payments commencing on december  and continuing through december  in addition  in conjunction with the note restructuring agreement  tandberg increased the margin we earn on distribution by two percentage points  effective january   until such time that we recover the forgiven principal amount on both notes totaling million 
in connection with the restructuring of our notes receivable and distribution agreements  we recorded a loss of million during  which represents lost interest income on the notes receivable 
during tandberg experienced liquidity problems and short term funding has been provided by outside investors 
the collection of the note receivable and realization of the intangible asset is dependent on the continued success of our relationship with tandberg and the liquidity of tandberg 
at december   we continue to believe the recorded note is collectible 
however  future events may impact this assessment

off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating lease commitments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are not using off balance sheet arrangements  including special purpose entities  nor do we have any contractual obligations  excluding our promissory notes  or commercial commitments with terms greater than one year that would significantly impact our liquidity 
summary of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years notes payable operating leases obligations purchase obligations contingent consideration payment other liabilities total does not include interest payments on the debt of approximately million  million and million which will be paid in  and  respectively 
the majority of the purchase obligations consist of day rolling estimates 
each month  we provide various 
table of contents suppliers with rolling forecasts of our demand for products for the next three months 
the forecasted amounts are generally binding on us as follows percent for the first month  percent for the second month and percent for the third month 
additional cash consideration of a minimum of million will be paid related to the memorex acquisition 
additional cash consideration of up to a maximum of million could be paid based on the financial performance of the acquisition through april except for the sale leaseback payments recorded in long term liabilities  timing of payments for the vast majority of the remaining liabilities  primarily consisting of pension  cannot be reasonably determined and as such have been included in the more than years category 
the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of december  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
we may be required to pay additional cash consideration of up to million and million related to the tdk recording media and the memcorp business acquisitions  respectively  contingent on future financial performance of the acquired businesses 
we have not recorded a liability for these contingent payments at december  as payment is not probable based on current financial performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant 
table of contents judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million as of december  and million as of december   including valuation allowances of million as of december  and million as of december  the valuation allowance relates to various world wide mainly germany operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
fiscal years and remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service 
the years through remain subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions and state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdictions 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
within the next months  we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of adopting this new standard as well as changes in unrecognized tax benefits during litigation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record a liability when a loss from litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position except for the philips dispute where damages claimed total million plus interest and costs  as well as a claim requesting a trebling of that amount 
imation believes that philips claims are without merit 
see item legal proceedings for a description of our dispute with philips 
as additional information becomes available  the potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
goodwill and other intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
other intangible assets are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
intangible assets are amortized using methods that approximate the benefit provided by utilization of the assets 
in determining the useful life of a trade name  we consider the following the overall strength of the trade name in the market in terms of market awareness and market share  the length of time that the trade name has been in existence  the period of time over which the trade name is expected to remain in use and the strength of the trade name and its perseverance through changes in the data storage industry 
in determining the useful lives of other intangible assets  we consider the period over which a majority of the economic benefits provided by the asset will be realized by the company 

table of contents the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  the determination of useful lives of intangible assets and subsequent impairment analyses require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
imation has determined that its reporting units are its segments with the exception of the americas data storage segment which is further divided between the americas consumer and americas commercial reporting units 
inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million consisting of a full impairment of the goodwill associated with our americas consumer and european reporting units 
prior to testing goodwill for impairment we tested our intangible assets for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and determined that there were no impairments of these assets 
we did not record impairment charges during the years ended december  and the goodwill impairment in was due to a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units  which resulted from a significant decrease in our stock price during the year 
our stock price declined from per share at january  to per share at the date of our annual impairment test at november  consequently  at november   the book value of our assets was higher than our market capitalization indicating potential impairment 
while we continually evaluate whether any indications of impairment are present which would require an impairment analysis on an interim basis  no such indicators were considered present prior to the fourth quarter of when our market capitalization first fell below our book value for an extended time period 
prior to the fourth quarter  based on the fact that our market capitalization exceeded our book value and our outlook for future results  we did not believe there were any indicators of impairment requiring interim testing of goodwill 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step one of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used a weighting of the valuations calculated using market multiples and the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold 
the summation of our reporting units fair values must be compared to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step two of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis uses forecasts over a year period with a residual growth rate of approximately percent thereafter 
we use management business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
discount rates between percent and percent were required to discount our projections to our market capitalization based on our share price at the date of our annual impairment test 

table of contents there are also various assumptions used under the market approach that affect the valuation of our reporting units 
the most significant assumptions are the market multiples and control premium 
in estimating the fair value of our company under the market approach  we considered the relative merits of commonly applied market capitalization multiples and the comparability of data between our company and the guideline public companies 
based on this analysis  we determined the market value of invested capital to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization multiple to be the most appropriate valuation multiple to be applied in the application of the market approach 
a control premium of percent was used in our determination of fair value which represents an estimate of the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the company 
the control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
as a result of our analysis of fair value from the combination of our discounted cash flow modeling and market comparisons  we utilized an implied stock price of per share in determining and allocating fair value to our reporting units as compared to a market price of per share on the november  testing date for goodwill impairment 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of november   goodwill in the americas consumer and europe reporting units failed step one of the impairment test and step two of the impairment test indicated that goodwill in these reporting units was fully impaired 
the indicated excess in fair value over carrying value of the company s three other reporting units in step one of the impairment test at november  and goodwill related to these reporting units is as follows excess of fair value over in millions goodwill carrying value americas commercial asia pacific electronic products based on the goodwill analysis performed as of november   a change of percent in the discount rate utilized corresponds to an implied stock price change of and would change the fair value for the respective business units as follows change in fair change in fair value from a value from a decrease in increase in in millions discount rate discount rate americas commercial asia pacific electronic products the tdk recording media acquisition included contractual provisions which require the purchase price to be adjusted if actual net assets received differ from a contractually specified target 
the company is finalizing negotiations to determine the purchase price and allocate tax bases to the assets purchased 
in determining the purchase price of the tdk recording media acquisition  the company made its best estimate of the outcome of this settlement process and of allocation of basis for tax purposes 
if the ultimate settlement differs from the company s estimate  adjustments to the purchase price  the amount of goodwill and its respective tax basis may be required 
to the extent that these adjustments are allocable to the reporting units where goodwill was impaired  the amount of the recorded impairment will be adjusted in future periods 
the company expects to complete the determination of the final purchase price in the first half of excess inventory and obsolescence accruals 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
as of december   the excess inventory and obsolescence accrual was million 

table of contents rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  
table of contents unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options  combination option strategies and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty
