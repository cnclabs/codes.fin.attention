business model changes to better align with industry practice  beginning in we changed our product offerings from software license arrangements to subscription service arrangements eg subscriptions 
as the industry and business models for software as a service or on demand have evolved  the standard form of sales arrangements are service agreements rather than licenses of software that can be hosted 
we believe providing offerings in this manner will ultimately increase our market penetration 
accordingly  our terms of sale have been revised to provide a hosting service where the customer accesses the software and data through the internet 
our previous terms of sale provided the customer a software license  and for no additional fee the customer could choose to have the software hosted by us  by themselves or by someone else 
revenue recognition for service arrangements was not materially different from our previous term license arrangements  as revenue under either type of contract is generally recognized ratably over the period of the agreement 
as a result of this change  the amount of deferred revenue on the balance sheet under subscription arrangements decreased since only the amount currently due from the customer is recorded to accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
conversely  under software license arrangements  the full customer commitment is recorded to receivables and deferred revenue whether or not currently due because we have the contractual right to collect the entire arrangement fee 
as part of this business model change  we essentially discontinued sales of perpetual software licenses which represented of our revenue in as compared to approximately of our revenue in although we expect to ultimately increase the lifetime value of our customer arrangements through sales of subscriptions  the substantive elimination of perpetual license sales materially and adversely impacted our operating results for when compared to as perpetual revenue has generally been recognized in full upon delivery of the license 
lastly  our policy for subscription contract acquisition costs  such as sales commissions  is to recognize them in proportion to the revenue recognized under the subscription arrangement 
since the majority of new business was subscriptions in  we believe this policy had and will have a material and beneficial impact on our and operating results  respectively 
commissions paid on license sales and professional services continue to be expensed when earned 
sources of revenue our revenue is comprised of fees for software  hosting and support  and fees for professional services 
software  hosting and support revenue includes fees earned under subscriptions and software license arrangements 
subscription arrangements include a bundled fee to access the software and data through our hosting services  and support services 
subscription revenue is recorded ratably over the length of the agreement 
our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers data which is physically located in third party facilities 
customers access hosted software and data through a secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
license arrangements can be over time a term license or perpetual 
for term licenses  software  hosting and support revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
perpetual license revenue is generally recorded in full upon delivery of the license  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual period 
perpetual license revenue ranged from to of our total revenue from through due to the change in our business model noted above  perpetual license revenue decreased from million  or of revenue in the year ending december  to million  or of revenue in the year ending december  we refer to recurring revenue in this report  which includes software  hosting and support revenue from term license and subscription agreements 
our sales arrangements generally provide customers with the right to use our software up to a maximum number of users or transactions 
a number of our arrangements provide for additional fees for usage above the maximum  which are billed and recognized into revenue when determinable and earned 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from consulting  education  development services  and reimbursement of related travel costs 
consulting and education services include implementation and best practices consulting 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
professional services revenue was approximately of total revenue in the past three years 
professional services are typically sold with initial sales arrangements and then periodically over the client engagement 
our typical education courses are billed on a per person  per class basis 
depending on the size and complexity of the client project  our consulting or development services contracts are either fixed price fixed scope or  more frequently  billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software and subscription arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses such as employee benefits  stock based compensation and payroll taxes for our hosting  support and professional services organizations  third party costs and equipment depreciation relating to our hosting services  third party costs for voice enabled crm applications  travel expenses related to providing professional services to our clients  amortization of acquired intangible assets and allocated overhead 
we allocate most overhead expenses  such as office supplies  computer supplies  utilities  rent  depreciation for furniture and equipment  payroll taxes and employee benefits  based on headcount 
as a result  these common overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  product management expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
for subscription arrangements  we expense the related sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized 
we expense our sales commissions on license arrangements when earned  which is typically at the time the related sale is invoiced to the client 
since the majority of our historical revenue has been from license arrangements recognized over time  we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of corresponding revenue 
we expect significant additional increases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase the level of marketing activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  translation fees  quality assurance  testing and allocated overhead 
to date  we have not capitalized internal software development costs because the timing of the commercial releases of our products has substantially coincided with the attainment of technological feasibility 
we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings 
to accomplish this  we plan to hire additional personnel and  from time to time  contract with third parties 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we seek to expand our technology and product offerings 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of receivables and deferred tax assets  and accounting for share based compensation 
revenue recognition beginning in  we changed the nature of our sales arrangements from license arrangements to subscription arrangements subscriptions 
for a bundled fee  subscriptions provide the customer with access to the software and data over the internet  or on demand  and provide technical support services and software upgrades when and if available 
under subscriptions  customers do not have the right to take possession of the software and  in accordance with eitf such arrangements are considered service contracts which are outside the scope of sop accordingly  we account for sales of subscriptions under eitf and recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement in accordance with sab prior to  we sold the majority of products under software license arrangements licenses and accounted for them in accordance with sop and sop licenses generally include multiple elements that are delivered up front or over time 
for example  under a term license  we deliver the software up front and provide hosting and support services over time 
fair value for each element in a license does not exist since none are sold separately  and consequently  the bundled revenue is recognized ratably over the length of the agreement 
under a perpetual license  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the hosting and support elements is based on the price charged at renewal when sold separately  and therefore the license element is recognized immediately into revenue upon delivery using the residual method  and the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
the application of these rules requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
fees charged for professional services are recognized when delivered 
we believe the fees for professional services qualify for separate accounting because a the services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for these services  and c performance of the services is considered probable and does not involve unique customer acceptance criteria 
our standard payment terms are net  although payment within days is considered normal 
we periodically provide extended payment terms and we consider any fees due beyond days to not be fixed and determinable in such cases  judgment is required in determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
changes to our practice of providing extended payment terms or providing concessions following a sale  may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and  in so doing  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current creditworthiness  customer concentration  age of the receivable balance  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates and exceed our related loss allowance 
income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when applicable  a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of our net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  and deductible timing differences 
the uncertainty of realizing these benefits is based primarily on our lack of taxable earnings 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin and it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fin requires judgment when evaluating tax positions 
the ultimate resolution of tax issues may result in a significant change to our recorded tax assets and liabilities 
share based compensation we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r beginning january  utilizing the modified prospective method 
this statement requires the cost of share based payment arrangements to be recorded in the statement of operations 
prior to  the estimated cost of share based payment arrangements was disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
share based compensation amounts are affected by our stock price as well as our assumptions regarding the expected volatility of our stock  our employee stock option exercise behaviors  forfeitures  and the related income tax effects 
our assumptions are based primarily on our historical information  some of which was developed when we were a private company 
recently issued accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies when other accounting pronouncements require fair value measurements  it does not require new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
on february   fsp fas was issued delaying the effective date of sfas no 
until fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
the guidance in fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  this statement provides companies with an option to report selected assets and liabilities principally financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r requires the use of full fair value to record all the identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the requirements are effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas requires the noncontrolling interests minority interests to be recorded at fair value and reported as a component of equity 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the requirements are effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue software  hosting and support professional services total revenue cost of revenue software  hosting and support professional services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss the following table sets forth our on demand customer interactions and our revenue by type and geography expressed as a percentage of total revenue for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  customer interactions in millions   revenue by type recurring subscriptions  term licenses  hosting and support perpetual licenses professional services revenue by geography in united states europe asia pacific overview of total revenue for the full year was million  compared to full year revenue of million 
within software  hosting and support  recurring revenue increased in over  which was offset by a decline in perpetual license revenue 
the decline in perpetual license revenue resulted from our business model change during to predominantly offer subscription service agreements instead of software license agreements 
recurring revenue increased in due to growth in average revenue per customer 
revenue per customer increased primarily from customer purchases of additional capacity and products  including rightnow sales to customers with annual revenues greater than billion and the public sector made up approximately of total revenue in  up from approximately of total revenue in and in during we continued to invest in our operations by adding capacity and a new data center for our hosting operations  sales and marketing personnel to focus on new customer acquisition  professional services personnel to support our solution offerings  and software developers to broaden and enhance our solution offerings 
these investments caused total expenses to increase during the increase in operating expenses combined with a lower proportion of perpetual license revenue resulted in an operating loss of of revenue in for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations compared to million of cash in  and increased our cash and short term investments balances to million at december  from million one year earlier 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
this deficit and our historical operating losses were primarily the result of costs incurred in the development  sales and marketing of our products and for general and administrative purposes

customer interactions  a measure of unique customer sessions hosted in our data centers  were approximately billion in  a increase over our client retention rate was approximately in and perpetual license revenue decreased million  or  in over  and decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in we believe this decrease resulted from accelerating customer adoption of on demand software 
beginning in  we changed the nature of our sales arrangements from software licenses to subscriptions  which largely eliminated sales of perpetual licenses 
the mix of perpetual license revenue affects our profitability in any given period since it is recorded in full into revenue upon delivery instead of being recorded ratably into revenue over time  as is the case with subscriptions and term licenses 
professional services revenue increased  or  in over the growth in professional services revenue is primarily due to a higher volume of large customer projects in the current year 
customers generally purchase professional services with initial license or subscription arrangements  and periodically over the life of the contract 
we also increased our capacity to deliver professional services by growing headcount in that organization to at december  from at december  the mix of professional services revenue affects our profitability from period to period due to the lower gross profit earned on professional services as compared to the gross profit earned on software  hosting and support revenue 
professional services revenue represented of total revenue in  and  and we expect it to range between and of total revenue in the future 
total revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  over total revenue of million for software  hosting and support revenue  consisting of recurring revenue and perpetual license revenue  increased million  or  over software  hosting and support revenue of million for recurring revenue increased over primarily due to a increase in the average number of customers and an increase in average revenue per customer

offsetting the increased salaries and related expenses were lower sales commission expenses caused by the deferral of sales commissions earned on subscription agreements 
as noted above  we changed the primary nature of our sales arrangements from licenses to subscriptions beginning in under license arrangements  we expense sales commissions when earned  which is typically upon issuance of a customer invoice 
under subscription arrangements  we defer the related sales commission costs and expense them in proportion to the revenue recognized

stock based compensation expense total stock based compensation expense for was million  a increase as compared to million in the year over year increase in stock based compensation expense results primarily from growth in the fair market value of our stock since our initial public offering in  which in turn drives growth in the estimated fair value of our stock options and the corresponding expense 
stock based compensation expense fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the underlying market value of our stock and changes in our valuation assumptions  such as the expected volatility of our stock  the expected time an option will be outstanding  and expected option forfeiture rates

our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  federal alternative minimum taxes  foreign rate differentials  and non deductible meal and entertainment expenses 
our effective tax rate in will depend on a number of factors  such as the amount and mix of stock based compensation expense to be recorded under sfas r  the level of business in state and foreign tax jurisdictions  management s expectation of the realization of deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance  and other factors 
at december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets that have been reserved in full by a valuation allowance 
in the future  if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets are realizable  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would increase income and equity or reduce goodwill  in the period such determination was made 
if and when that happens  our effective income tax rate will increase to more closely approximate the federal statutory rate

in  we substantially eliminated sales of perpetual licenses 
the mix of term and perpetual software licenses sold in each quarter impacts our quarterly results of operations 
during the quarters of and  perpetual license revenue trended lower as a percent of our overall new business  which we believe was caused by accelerating customer adoption of on demand software and sales arrangements in  and our business model change to essentially eliminate perpetual revenue from our business model 
professional services revenue has ranged from to of total revenue  and generally increased in dollar terms due to the expansion of our solution usage in our customer base 
quarter to quarter variations in professional services revenue occurs because of customer scheduling requirements  and training and education of newly hired personnel 
as a percentage of revenue  all cost and expense categories increased in as compared to mostly due to the substantial elimination of perpetual license revenue beginning in sequential quarterly improvement in operating margins in resulted primarily from growth in recurring revenue 
the amount and timing of our operating results generally will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our level of actual and anticipated business activities 
factors affecting quarterly operating results can include  but are not limited to our ability to retain and increase sales to existing clients  attract new clients and satisfy our clients requirements  the mix of revenue between license arrangements  professional services and subscription arrangements as sales commissions are generally expensed when invoiced for license arrangements and professional services  and expensed ratably over the term of an agreement for subscription services  changes in the mix of revenue between professional services and software  hosting and support  because the gross margin on professional services is typically lower than the gross margin on software  hosting and support  changes in the mix of voice self service applications sold and or usage volume  because the gross margin on voice self service applications is typically lower than the gross margin on our sales  marketing  feedback and service applications  the timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors  the timing of professional service sales and our ability to appropriately staff and train professional service resources without negatively impacting professional service margins  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the amount and timing of expenditures related to expanding our operations  changes in our assumptions of stock price volatility  employee exercise behaviors  and option forfeiture rates  or changes in the number of stock options granted and vesting requirements in any particular period  which effects the amount of stock based compensation expense  changes in the payment terms for our products and services  including changes in the mix of payment options chosen by our customers  the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our clients  changes in the volume and mix of subscriptions and perpetual licenses sold in a particular quarter  because perpetual license revenue is recorded into revenue upon delivery whereas subscriptions are recorded into revenue ratably over the contractual period  and general economic  industry and market conditions 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
as a result  you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
we have experienced seasonality in certain aspects of our business including increased purchasing when our clients fiscal years are ending

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  percent change percent change amounts in thousands deferred revenue    cash provided by operating activities   we have historically funded our operations with cash from operations  equity financings and debt borrowings 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments  totaled million 
in addition to our cash and short term investments  other sources of liquidity at december  included a million bank line of credit facility  under which there were no borrowings in or operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december  as compared to million in and million in the majority of our cash from operations in all three years was from net income loss adjusted for non cash charges  collection of receivables  partially offset by growth in deferred commissions 
we typically bill customers on net day terms at the beginning of the contract period  which is reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
in periods of increasing sales  we would expect growth in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
this growth  historically  has provided funding for operations 
a change in the billing practice resulting in delayed payment terms could have a material adverse effect on cash provided from operating activities and growth in deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue was consistent year over year at million mostly due to the shift in our business model at the beginning of  which resulted in deferred revenue representing the amount currently due and payable 
under license arrangements  the full customer commitment is reflected in accounts receivable for amounts currently due  or term receivables for amounts due over the contractual term  and deferred revenue 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable represented approximately of current accounts and term receivables at december  and  respectively 
accounts written off in were relatively constant as a percentage of new billings from the previous year 
we regularly assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual write offs could exceed our estimates and adversely affect operating cash flows in the future 
we have approximately million of payments due in under contractual obligations and purchase commitments for operating and capital leases  hosting services and other items 
total purchase commitments at december  were million to be paid per the schedule below 
we believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy these commitments in investing activities consumed million in  which included million net purchases of short term investments  and million for capital expenditures 
capital asset additions during the past three years consisted of equipment acquisitions for our hosting operations and employee growth  and are expected to range between million and million for business acquisitions in and required million to acquire salesnet  inc  and million for the assets of convergent voice  respectively 
cash used in investing activities in was million  of which million was due to net purchases of short term investments 
in  investing activities provided million due to liquidation of short term investments offset primarily by purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities provided million in  million in and million in financing sources included the exercise of employee stock options under our equity incentive plan and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations  should be sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth and expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the possible acquisition of complementary products or businesses  the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
additional equity or debt financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
as of december   the company held approximately million in auction rate securities with investment grades of aaa or aa 
auction rate securities are long term bonds or preferred stocks that act like short term debt  in which interest rates reset in dutch auctions held daily  weekly or monthly which historically provided liquidity for these investments 
despite the long term contractual maturities of the auction rate securities  all of these securities are available for sale and were available to fund the company s current operations 
all securities experienced successful auctions subsequent to year end 
however  in february and march  uncertainties in the credit markets caused all auctions of the company s securities to be unsuccessful 
an unsuccessful auction is an event when there are fewer securities bid for than are available for sale 
upon an unsuccessful auction  the security is reset at a predetermined interest rate 
given that all of the securities experienced successful auctions subsequent to december   the company does not believe that the current state of the credit markets requires it to adjust the fair value of its portfolio of auction rate securities or to reclassify them as long term marketable securities on its december  consolidated balance sheets 
to date  we have collected all interest payable on all of our auction rate securities when due 
if the auction rate securities continue to experience unsuccessful auctions  or if the credit rating of the auction rate security issuer or the third party insurer of the issuers of the investments underlying the securities deteriorates  we may be required to reclassify the securities on our balance sheet and or adjust the carrying value of the auction rate security through an impairment charge 
while the recent auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  dividend payments or other business requirements 
the company will continue to monitor the state of the credit markets and its potential impact  if any  on the fair value and classification of our portfolio of auction rate securities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations     obligations under capital leases purchase obligations hosting services   purchase obligations other total      we lease our office facilities and certain office equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through obligations under capital leases pertain to certain tenant improvements in our main office facility 
purchase obligations consist of agreements with third parties to provide co location services for hosting operations  and obligations for marketing and other miscellaneous services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuation due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen  because our contracts are frequently denominated in local currency 
in the future  we may utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
we do not currently have any such contracts in place  nor did we enter into any such contracts during the years ended december  or december  interest rate sensitivity our investments consist of short term  interest bearing securities  which are subject to credit and interest rate risk 
our portfolio is investment grade and diversified among issuers and security types to reduce credit risk 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a large portion of our investment portfolio in instruments with short maturities or frequent interest rate resets 
we also manage interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents such that we are able to hold investments until maturity 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from the level at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  liquidation and valuation risk our short term investments consist of approximately million in auction rate securities with investment grades of aaa or aa  as of december  despite the long term contractual maturities of the auction rate securities  all of these securities are available for sale 
in march and february uncertainties in the credit markets caused all auctions of the company s securities to be unsuccessful 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
based on the company s expected operating cash flows  and other sources and uses of cash  the company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect its ability to execute its current business plan 
the company will continue to monitor the state of the credit markets and its potential impact  if any  on the fair value and classification of our portfolio of auction rate securities
