item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements 
in some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions  risks  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the sec 
there also are other factors that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
following is a discussion of some of the more significant risks that could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to successfully implement our strategic plan 
our strategic plan is designed to improve revenues  reduce costs and improve working capital management 
we are taking various measures to achieve these goals  including focusing on higher margin products through product portfolio management  adjusting our manufacturing operations by reducing or increasing plant output  acquiring businesses  moving production to low cost regions  expanding our business in emerging markets and recruiting and retaining talented associates 
there is a risk that we may not be successful in executing these measures to achieve the expected results 
for example  we may be unable to reduce costs to anticipated levels to achieve the benefits from moving to low cost regions  product quality may be adversely impacted as a result of these manufacturing initiatives  and we may not achieve anticipated improved revenue growth because of lower sales of legacy products  lower sales from acquired companies  or the inability to acquire businesses to augment revenues 
any change in the level of economic activity in our major geographical markets may have an impact on the level of demand for our products and our resulting revenue and earnings 
the demand for many of our products is economically sensitive and will vary with general economic activity  trends in nonresidential construction  investment in manufacturing facilities and automation  demand for information technology equipment  and other economic factors 
changes in the price and availability of raw materials we use could be detrimental to our profitability 
copper is a significant component of the cost of most of our products 
over the past three years  the prices of metals  particularly copper  have been highly volatile 
copper rose rapidly in price for much of this period and remains a volatile commodity 
other materials we use  such as pvc and other plastics derived from petrochemical feedstocks  have also risen in price 
generally  we have recovered much of the higher cost of raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products 
the majority of our products are sold through distribution  and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists which we update from time to time  with new prices taking effect a few weeks after they are announced 
some oem contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost changes  generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months 
if we are unable to raise prices sufficiently to recover our material costs  our earnings will be reduced 
if we raise our prices but competitors raise their prices less  we may lose sales  and our earnings will be reduced 
if the price of copper were to decline  we might be forced to reduce prices  which could have a negative effect on revenue  and we may be required  according to the terms of contracts with certain of our distributors  to reimburse them for a portion of the price they paid for our products in their inventory 
we believe the supply of raw materials copper  plastics  and other materials is adequate and we do not expect any substantial interruption of supply or shortage of materials 
if such a supply interruption or shortage were to occur  however  this could have a negative effect on revenue and earnings 

table of contents the global cable and connectivity industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other manufacturers of cable  wire  connectivity and related products based in north america  europe and asia 
these companies compete on price  reputation and quality  product characteristics  and terms 
actions that may be taken by competitors  including pricing  business alliances  new product introductions  and other actions  could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability 
well established global manufacturers of switches and automation equipment could decide to market industrial ethernet switches and capture market share from us 
if one or more large companies with expertise in ethernet switches or industrial automation were to pursue a leading position in the industrial ethernet market  we might not be able to maintain our market share 
some potential competitors have very well known brands  ample resources for product development  and advantageous commercial relationships 
if our position in this market eroded  a significant element of our strategy for improving revenue growth and profitability would be jeopardized 
we rely on several key distributors in marketing our products 
the majority of our sales are through distributors 
these distributors carry the products of competitors along with our products 
our largest distributor customer  anixter international inc  accounted for of our revenue in if we were to lose a key distributor  our revenue and profits would likely be reduced  at least temporarily 
in the past  we have seen a few distributors acquired and consolidated 
if there were further consolidation of the electronics and cable distributors  this could have an effect on our relationships with these distributors 
it could also result in consolidation of distributor inventory  which would temporarily depress our revenue 
we have also experienced financial failure of distributors from time to time  resulting in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full 
our effective income tax rate may vary from year to year because of the mix of income and losses among various tax jurisdictions in which we do business 
our effective income tax rate is the result of the income tax rates in the various countries in which we do business 
our mix of income and losses in these jurisdictions determines our effective tax rate 
more income in higher tax rate jurisdictions or more losses in lower tax rate jurisdictions would increase our effective tax rate and thus lower our net income 
if we generate losses in tax jurisdictions for which no benefits are available  our effective income tax rate will increase 
we might be unable to achieve planned cost savings 
the plans for our business include both revenue improvement and cost saving initiatives 
for example  we substantially completed a restructuring program concerning manufacturing operations in north america during the restructuring program is expected to reduce manufacturing costs 
we have also announced plans to implement lean enterprise practices throughout our organization  which are expected to reduce inventory and manufacturing costs 
if we do not achieve all the planned savings  we might not achieve expected levels of profitability 
we are subject to current environmental and other laws and regulations 
we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we do business 
we are currently  and may in the future be  held responsible for remedial investigations and clean up costs of certain sites damaged by the discharge of hazardous substances  including sites that have never been owned or operated by us but at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws 
changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 

table of contents if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to recognize charges that would reduce our income 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually  or more often in certain circumstances if events indicate that the asset values are not recoverable 
we have incurred charges in the past for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and we may be required to do so again in future periods 
such a charge would reduce our income without any change to our underlying cash flow 
changes in accounting rules and interpretation of these rules may affect our reported earnings 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are complex and require interpretation 
these principles change from time to time  and such changes may result in changes to our reported income without any change in our underlying cash flow 
because we do business in many countries  our results of operations are affected by changes in currency exchange rates and are subject to political and economic uncertainties 
more than half of our sales are outside the united states 
other than the united states dollar  the principal currencies to which we are exposed through our manufacturing operations and sales are the euro  the canadian dollar  the hong kong dollar  the chinese renminbi and the british pound 
in most cases  we have revenues and costs in the same currency  thereby reducing our overall currency risk 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the results of our non us operations are translated at a lower exchange rate and thus into lower reported earnings 
we have manufacturing facilities in china  canada  mexico and several european countries 
we rely on suppliers in many countries  including china 
our foreign operations are subject to economic and political risks inherent in maintaining operations abroad such as economic and political destabilization  land use risks  international conflicts  restrictive actions by foreign governments  and adverse foreign tax laws 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
our markets are characterized by the introduction of increasingly capable products  including fiber optic and wireless signal transmission solutions that compete with the copper cable solutions that comprise the majority of our revenue 
the relative costs and merits of copper cable solutions  fiber optic cable solutions  and wireless solutions could change in the future as various competing technologies address the market opportunities 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products that meet or anticipate such changes 
we have long been successful in introducing successive generations of more capable products  but if we were to fail to keep pace with technology or with the products of competitors  we might lose market share and harm our reputation and position as a technology leader in our markets 
competing technologies could cause the obsolescence of many of our products 
see the discussion above in part i  item  under importance of new products 
we have defined benefit pension plans that are not fully funded 
we have defined benefit pension plans in the united states  the united kingdom  canada and germany 
the cash funding requirements for these plans depends on the financial performance of the funds assets  actuarial life expectancies  discount rates and other factors 
the fair value of the assets in the plans may be less than the projected benefits owed by us 
in most years  we are required to contribute cash to fund the pension plans  and the amount of funding required may vary significantly 
some of our employees are members of collective bargaining groups  and we might be subject to labor actions that would interrupt our business 
some of our employees  primarily outside the united states  are members of collective bargaining units 
we believe that our relations with employees are generally good 
however  if there were a dispute with one of these 
table of contents bargaining units  the affected operations could be interrupted resulting in lost revenues  lost profit contribution  and customer dissatisfaction 
we might have difficulty protecting our intellectual property from use by competitors  or competitors might accuse us of violating their intellectual property rights 
disagreements about patents and intellectual property rights occur in our industry 
sometimes these disagreements are settled through an agreement for one party to pay royalties to another 
the unfavorable resolution of an intellectual property dispute could preclude us from manufacturing and selling certain products  could require us to pay a royalty on the sale of certain products  or could impair our competitive advantage if a competitor wins the right to sell products we believe we invented 
intellectual property disputes could result in legal fees and other costs 
we have in the past closed plants and reduced the size of our workforce  and we might elect to do so again in the future 
much of our manufacturing capacity is in the united states and western europe  which are relatively high cost regions 
over the past few years  as a result of the merger and in furtherance of our regional manufacturing strategy  we consolidated our capacity by closing several manufacturing plants and eliminating jobs in the united states  canada and europe 
we incurred asset impairment charges  severance charges and other costs in relation to these plant closures 
if we decide to close additional facilities  we could incur significant cash and non cash charges in connection with these actions 
product portfolio management actions could also lead to non cash asset impairment charges in the future 
if we are unable to retain senior management and key employees  our business operations could be adversely affected 
our success has been largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management and key employees 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees could have an adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to find qualified replacements for these individuals if their services were no longer available  or if we do identify replacements  that the integration of those replacements will not be disruptive to our business 
belden s strategic plan includes further acquisitions 
our ability successfully to acquire businesses may decline if the competition among potential buyers increases or the cost of acquiring suitable businesses becomes too expensive 
as a result  we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire 
alternatively  at the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself  internal and external pressures  including  but not limited to  our borrowing capacity or the availability of alternative financing  may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition 
our ability to implement our business strategy and grow our business  particularly through acquisitions  may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations of acquired businesses 
should we fail to integrate their operations  our results of operations and profitability could be negatively impacted 
we believe we have been successful in integrating the operations of recently acquired businesses with belden 
our strategy includes further acquisitions  which might not perform as we expect 
some of the integration challenges we might face include differences in corporate culture and management styles  additional or conflicting governmental regulations  preparation of the acquired operations for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  financial reporting that is not in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  disparate company policies and practices  customer relationship issues and retention of key personnel 
in addition  management may be required to devote a considerable amount of time to the integration process  which could decrease the amount of time we have to manage the other businesses 
some of the businesses we are interested in acquiring 
table of contents involve more complex technology and shorter product life cycles than are typical for belden  and we might not be able to properly evaluate and develop the technology 
we cannot make assurances that we will successfully or cost effectively integrate operations 
the failure to do so could have a negative effect on results of operations or profitability 
the process of integrating operations could cause some interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  the activities of acquired businesses 
one aspect of belden s strategic plan is further expansion into connectivity 
the expansion of our connectivity product portfolio will most likely continue to take place through acquisitions 
connectivity products generally involve more research and development spending  relative to sales  than cable products 
if we do not adequately invest in research and development or if our efforts to introduce new products are not successful  our revenue from the acquired businesses might not meet our expectations 
the channel structure for these products might be different from our traditional channels 
we cannot make assurances that we will successfully manage the commercial integration of any acquisition 
this list of risk factors is not exhaustive 
other considerations besides those mentioned above might cause our actual results to differ from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement

we believe our physical facilities are suitable for their present and intended purposes and adequate for our current level of operations 
item legal proceedings we are a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions that are incidental to our operations 
these proceedings include personal injury cases  about of which we were aware at february   in which we are one of many defendants  of which are scheduled for trial during electricians have filed a majority of these cases  primarily in new jersey and pennsylvania  generally seeking compensatory  special and punitive damages 
typically in these cases  the claimant alleges injury from alleged exposure to heat resistant asbestos fiber 
our alleged predecessors had a small number of products that contained the fiber  but ceased production of such products more than years ago 
through february   we have been dismissed  or reached agreement to be dismissed  in approximately similar cases without any going to trial  and with only of these involving any payment to the claimant 
we have insurance that we believe should cover a significant portion of any defense or settlement costs borne by us in these types of cases 
in our opinion  the proceedings and actions in which we are involved should not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results  or cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  and market signal transmission solutions for data networking and a wide range of specialty electronics markets including entertainment  industrial  security  consumer electronics and aerospace applications 
we strive to create shareholder value by managing our product portfolio to position products according to value  eliminate low margin revenue  and increase revenue in higher margin and strategically important products  protecting and enhancing the perceived value of the belden brand and our family of brands  continuously improving business processes throughout the enterprise via a comprehensive lean tool set and the institution of a continuous improvement mind set across the company  recruiting and developing the best talent we can find and improving the effectiveness of our performance management processes  migrating our manufacturing capacity to low cost locations within each major geographic region to be closer to our customers and to reduce the landed cost of our products  investing in both organic and inorganic growth in fast growing regions  capturing additional market share by improving channel relationships  improving our capability to serve global accounts  and concentrating sales efforts on solution selling and vertical markets  and migrating from copper based transmission technologies to signal transmission solutions via fiber  wireless and copper  and enriching our product portfolio by offering connectors  passive and active components and embedded transmission solutions 
to accomplish these goals  we use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality  delivery  cost  and innovation 
we consider revenue growth  operating margin  cash flows  return on invested capital and working capital management metrics to be our key operating performance indicators 
we also desire to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve the objectives described above 
the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect our overall growth  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we are a multinational corporation with global operations 
approximately of our sales were derived outside the united states in as a global business  our operations are affected by worldwide  regional  and industry economic and political factors 
our market and geographic diversity has helped limit the impact of any one market or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 
given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served  we use indices concerning general economic trends to predict our outlook for the future 
our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers  including to the extent possible their sales  to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 
while differences exist among our businesses  we generally continued to see broad based market expansion during we supplemented this market expansion with revenue growth derived from our three business acquisitions made during consolidated revenues for increased over revenues from the acquired businesses contributed of the total growth 
revenues derived from existing businesses for the year references to revenues derived from existing businesses in this report include revenues derived from acquired businesses starting from the first anniversary of the acquisition  but exclude currency effect and revenues from divested operations contributed growth 
the impact of currency translation on revenues contributed growth 
these increases were partially offset by lost revenues from divested operations that contributed a reduction in revenue 
consolidated revenues for increased over revenues derived from existing businesses for the year contributed growth 
the impact of currency translation on revenues contributed the additional growth 
we continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment in the markets and geographies served 
our performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in these 
table of contents markets and geographies  including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force  expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets such as china and india  migration away from a fragmented  sub scale  high cost manufacturing footprint  and potential volatility in raw material costs 
although we use the united states dollar as our functional currency for reporting purposes  a substantial portion of our assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows reside in or are derived from countries other than the united states 
these assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows are translated from local currencies into the united states dollar using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
we have generally accepted the exposure to currency exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the united states dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows in our consolidated financial statements 
significant events in during  we completed three acquisitions 
we acquired hirschmann automation and control gmbh hirschmann on march  for million 
hirschmann has its headquarters in germany and is a leading supplier of industrial ethernet solutions and industrial connectivity 
the acquisition of hirschmann enables us to deliver connectivity and networking solutions for demanding industrial environments and large scale infrastructure projects worldwide 
on march   we acquired ltk wiring co 
ltd 
ltk  a hong kong company  for million 
ltk is one of the largest manufacturers of electronic cable for the china market 
ltk gives us a strong presence in china among oem customers  including consumer electronics manufacturers 
on april   we completed the purchase of the assets of lumberg automation components lumberg automation for million 
lumberg automation has its headquarters in germany and is a leading supplier of industrial connectors  high performance cord sets and fieldbus communication components for factory automation machinery 
lumberg automation complements the industrial connectivity portfolio of hirschmann as well as our expertise in signal transmission 
the results of operations of each acquisition have been included in our results of operations from their respective acquisition dates 
hirschmann and lumberg automation are included in the europe segment  and ltk is included in the asia pacific segment 
we have implemented restructuring actions during in both europe and north america and initiated position eliminations worldwide in in europe  we exited the united kingdom telecommunications cable market  ceased to manufacture certain products in hungary  the czech republic  and the netherlands  sold our telecommunications cable operation in the czech republic  and sold a plant in sweden in an effort to reduce manufacturing floor space and overhead and to streamline administrative processes 
in north america  we have constructed a new plant in mexico  sold plants in canada  south carolina  illinois and vermont  and announced the closure of a plant in kentucky in an effort to reduce our manufacturing costs 
we have initiated position eliminations worldwide in an effort to streamline production support  sales  and administrative operations 
at the end of  we announced a voluntary separation program to salaried associates in the united states who are at least years of age and have years of service with the company 
as a result of our restructuring actions  we recognized severance  asset impairment  and adjusted depreciation costs in  and in  we expect to recognize million of additional severance costs related to the voluntary separation program 
we may also recognize additional asset impairment expenses including potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets depending on how our restructuring actions impact our operating results 
furthermore  any new restructuring actions would likely result in additional charges for severance  adjusted depreciation and asset impairments 

table of contents results of operations consolidated continuing operations percentage change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations revenues increased in compared to primarily for the following reasons we acquired hirschmann  ltk and lumberg automation in  which contributed revenues of million and represented percentage points of the revenue increase 
revenues also increased due to increased selling prices and favorable product mix that resulted primarily from our strategic initiative in portfolio management to reposition many products for margin improvement 
sales price increases and favorable product mix contributed percentage points of the revenue increase 
favorable currency translation contributed percentage points of the revenue increase 
the positive impact that the factors listed above had on the revenue comparison were partially offset by the following factors a decline in unit sales volume due to our strategic initiative in product portfolio management that increased prices of certain lower margin products represented a percentage point decrease 
lost sales from the disposal of our telecommunications cable operation in the czech republic represented a percentage point decrease 
gross profit increased in compared to primarily for the following reasons the three recent acquisitions contributed in total million of gross profit in we increased prices and deemphasized certain lower margin products as part of our product portfolio management initiative 
we closed plants in south carolina  illinois  and sweden and reduced production at a plant in kentucky as part of our regional manufacturing strategic initiative 
we recognized million of lower excess and obsolete inventory charges in the decrease in excess and obsolete inventory charges was primarily due to a change in in the parameters we used to identify such inventories 
the parameters were changed to conform to our goal to better manage our working capital and reduce our reliance on finished goods inventory as well as to include a more consistent definition of what constitutes excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognized million of lower severance costs in severance costs recognized in primarily related to north american restructuring actions 
severance costs recognized in primarily related to european restructuring actions 

table of contents the positive impact that the factors listed above had on the gross profit comparison were partially offset by the following factors we incurred million of additional cost of sales in due to the nonrecurring effects of purchase accounting  primarily inventory cost step up related to the three recent acquisitions 
we incurred redundant costs and inefficiencies as we continue to shift production from high cost to low cost locations 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in compared to primarily for the following reasons the three recent acquisitions incurred in total million of sg a expenses in  which includes million of recurring amortization expense and million of nonrecurring amortization expense of intangible assets 
excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions  we recognized share based compensation costs in that exceeded those recognized in by million primarily due to incremental expense from the annual equity awards made in february we incurred an increase in salaries  wages  and associated fringe benefits costs in primarily due to increased annual incentive plan compensation and additional headcount 
in  we completed the sale of our telecommunications cable operation in the czech republic for million and recorded a gain of million 
we also sold a plant in illinois as part of our previously announced restructuring plan and recorded a gain of million 
in  we sold property  plant and equipment in sweden for a gain of million 
in  we identified certain tangible long lived assets related to our plants in czech republic  the netherlands and canada for which the carrying values were not fully recoverable 
we recognized an impairment loss related to these assets totaling million 
in  we determined that certain asset groups in the belden americas and europe operating segments were impaired and recognized impairment losses totaling million 
operating income increased in compared to primarily due to the favorable gross profit comparison  gain on sale of assets and lower asset impairment charges partially offset by the unfavorable sg a expense comparison discussed above 
income from continuing operations before taxes increased in compared to due to higher operating income partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from the march issuance of senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
our effective annual tax rate decreased from in to in this change is primarily attributable to the release of previously recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the netherlands and germany in as a result of improved profitability in these regions and to a greater percentage of our income coming from low tax jurisdictions 
income from continuing operations increased in compared to due to higher pretax income partially offset by higher income tax expense 
consequently  return on invested capital defined as net income plus interest expense after tax divided by average total capital  which is the sum of stockholders equity  long term debt and current debt in was compared to in revenues generated in increased from revenues generated in because of increased selling prices  increased unit sales volume  favorable product mix  and favorable foreign currency translation on international revenues 
price improvement resulted primarily from the impact of sales price increases we implemented during across most product lines in response to increases in the costs of copper and commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks and improved pricing practices at certain of our operations 
the price of copper  our primary raw material  increased from per pound at december  to per pound at december  and per pound at december  sales price increases contributed approximately percentage points of the revenue increase 
favorable currency translation contributed percentage points of revenue increase 
table of contents in higher unit sales of products with industrial  video sound security vss  and transportation defense td applications were partially offset by a decrease in unit sales of products with communications networking cn applications  but still contributed approximately percentage point of revenue increase 
unit sales of products with industrial  vss  and td applications improved during because of increased demand from customers in the fossil fuels  power generation  and broadcast industries and facilities manufacturing these products improved their order fill rates and reduced their backlog 
unit sales of products with cn applications declined in as a result of our product portfolio management initiatives 
although unit sales of products with cn applications decreased from to  gross margins improved as a result of our product portfolio management actions 
gross profit increased in from the prior year primarily because of the revenue increase discussed above 
higher cost of sales in resulted from increased variable production costs necessary to support improved unit sales  the increase in copper and certain other raw materials costs  excess and obsolete inventory charges resulting primarily from a change in the parameters we used to identify such inventories that exceeded those recognized in by million  severance costs that exceeded those recognized in by million  and adjusted depreciation costs that exceeded those recognized in by million 
in  we recognized severance expense totaling million related primarily to the restructuring actions in europe and north america and worldwide position eliminations 
we also recognized adjusted depreciation costs totaling million in related to the restructuring actions in europe and north america 
these negative factors impacting the gross profit comparison were partially offset by the positive impact of manufacturing cost reduction actions including the closures of two manufacturing facilities in the united states and sweden during selling  general and administrative expenses recognized in were relatively unchanged from those recognized in in  we recognized share based compensation costs that exceeded those recognized in the prior year by million primarily because of the adoption of sfas no 
r  severance costs that exceeded those recognized in by million  and travel costs that exceeded those recognized in the prior year by million because of increased travel related to our various strategic initiatives 
these increased costs were offset by salary costs recognized in that exceeded those recognized in the current year by million primarily because of employee terminations related to the restructuring actions in europe and north america  gains recognized on the disposals of tangible assets in that exceeded those recognized in the prior year by million  and other sg a expenses recognized in that exceeded those recognized in by million 
in  we recognized severance expense totaling million related primarily to the restructuring actions in europe and north america and worldwide position eliminations 
in  we also recognized gains on disposals of tangible assets primarily in our netherlands  czech republic  and sweden manufacturing facilities totaling million related to the restructuring actions in europe 
operating income increased in from the prior year because of the favorable gross profit comparison partially offset by asset impairment charges recognized in that exceeded those recognized in the prior year by million and million in nonrecurring minimum requirements contract income recognized in in  we recognized asset impairment expenses totaling million related to the restructuring actions in europe and north america 
income from continuing operations before taxes increased in from because of higher operating income  lower interest expense  and higher interest income 
interest expense recognized in decreased by million from that recognized in because we repaid medium term notes totaling million  million  and million in august  august  and september  respectively 
interest income earned on cash equivalents in increased by million from because of higher cash equivalents and increased interest rates 
our effective annual tax rate changed from in to in this change is primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowances recognized as a percentage of pretax income and to a decrease in goodwill impairment charges on which no tax benefit was recognized 
incremental deferred tax asset valuation allowances recognized against foreign net operating loss carryforwards decreased from million in to million in goodwill impairment charges decreased from million in to in

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
we provide a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following circumstances are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs in the period in which the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the products specified in the customer s purchase order or sales agreement 
accounts receivable we sometimes grant trade  promotion  and other special price reductions such as meet competition pricing  price protection  contract pricing  and on time payment discounts to certain of our customers 
we also adjust receivables balances for  among other things  correction of billing errors  incorrect shipments  and settlement of customer disputes 
customers are allowed to return inventory if and when certain conditions regarding the physical state of the inventory and our approval of the return are met 
certain distribution customers are allowed to return inventory at original cost  in an amount not to exceed three percent of the prior year s purchases  in exchange for an order of equal or greater value 
until we can process these reductions  corrections  and returns together  the adjustments through individual customer records  we estimate the amount of outstanding adjustments and recognize them against our gross accounts receivable and gross revenues 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated sales demand  trends in product pricing  and historical and anticipated adjustments patterns 
we charge revisions to these estimates back to accounts receivable and revenues in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to further reduce prices and increase customer return authorizations  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of accounts receivable and revenues at the time the reduction or return is authorized 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the specific identification method 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of accounts receivable  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability or unwillingness to pay outstanding amounts  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to its estimated collectible balance 
there have been occasions in the past where we recognized an expense associated with the rapid collapse of a distributor for which no specific reserve had been previously established 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
inventories we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis in light of historical and anticipated sales demand  technological changes  product life cycle  component cost trends  product pricing and inventory condition 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of historical and anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition or where inventory cost exceeds net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
in  we changed the parameters we apply to calculate our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories to conform to our goal to better manage our working capital and reduce our reliance on finished goods inventory as well as to include a more consistent definition of what constitutes excess and obsolete inventory 
revisions to these inventory adjustments would be required if any of the factors mentioned above differed from our estimates 

table of contents deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards  and deductible temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before taxes under gaap 
deferred tax assets generally represent future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required when some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we are required to estimate taxable income in future years or develop tax strategies that would enable tax asset realization in each taxing jurisdiction and use judgment to determine whether or not to record a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
we establish accruals for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that our tax return positions may not be fully sustained 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  there could be a material effect on our income tax provisions in the period in which each such determination is made 
in addition  certain portions of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed income are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  we do not record a provision for united states federal and state income taxes on this foreign income 
if this income was not considered to be indefinitely reinvested  it would be subject to united states federal and state income taxes and could materially effect our income tax provision 
long lived assets the valuation and classification of long lived assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives and salvage values involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these long lived assets under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of asset groups and reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
we test our tangible long lived assets and intangible long lived assets subject to amortization for impairment when indicators of impairment exist 
we test our goodwill and intangible long lived assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist 
we base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are not predictable with precision and therefore are inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
accrued sales rebates we grant incentive rebates to selected distributors as part of our sales programs 
the rebates are determined based on certain targeted sales volumes 
rebates are paid quarterly or annually in either cash or receivables credits 
until we can process these rebates through individual customer records  we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and recognize them as accrued liabilities and reductions in our gross revenues 
we base our estimates on both historical and anticipated sales demand and rebate program participation 
we charge revisions to these estimates back to accrued liabilities and revenues in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to increase sales rebates offered  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in accrued liabilities and an incremental reduction in revenues at the time the rebate is offered 
contingent liabilities we have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we review the valuation of these liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust the balances to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and establish additional liabilities for emerging issues 

table of contents while we believe that the current level of liabilities is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
pension and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions relate to discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates and other factors 
we base the discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high quality corporate long term bonds 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future or near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of the lesser of of the projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets  amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
share based compensation we compensate certain employees with various forms of share based payment awards and recognize compensation costs for these awards based on their fair values 
the fair values of certain awards are estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which incorporates certain assumptions regarding the expected term of an award and expected stock price volatility 
we develop the expected term assumption based on the vesting period and contractual term of an award  our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation experience  our stock price history  plan provisions that require exercise or cancellation of awards after employees terminate  and the extent to which currently available information indicates that the future is reasonably expected to differ from past experience 
we develop the expected volatility assumption based on monthly historical price data for our common stock and other economic data trended into future years 
after calculating the aggregate fair value of an award  we use an estimated forfeiture rate to discount the amount of share based compensation cost to be recognized in our operating results over the service period of the award 
we develop the forfeiture assumption based on our historical pre vesting cancellation experience 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the business combination date 
we also identify and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
we have historically relied upon the use of third party valuation specialists to assist in the estimation of fair values for tangible long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill 
the carrying values of acquired receivables  inventories  and accounts payable have historically approximated their fair values at the business combination date 
with respect to accrued liabilities acquired  we use all available information to make our best estimates of their fair values at the business combination date 
when necessary  we rely upon the use of third party actuaries to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices  interest rates and credit extended to customers 
to manage the volatility relating to exposures  we net the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
for residual exposures  we sometimes use derivative financial instruments pursuant to our policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the terms of such instruments and the transactions to which they relate generally do not exceed twelve months 
each of these risks is discussed below 

table of contents currency exchange rate risk for most of our products  the currency in which we sell the product is the same as the currency in which we incur the costs to manufacture the product  resulting in a natural hedge 
however  when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the results of our non us operations are translated at a lower exchange rate and thus into lower reported earnings 
our currency exchange rate management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as the offsetting or netting of like currency cash flows 
where natural techniques are not possible  we will sometimes use foreign currency derivatives  typically foreign currency forward contracts  with durations of generally months or less 
we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december  and did not employ any foreign currency derivatives during the year then ended 
we generally view as long term our investments in international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the united states dollar 
as a result  we do not generally use derivatives to manage these net investments 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  we are exposed primarily to exchange rate movements between the united states dollar and the euro  canadian dollar  hong kong dollar  and british pound 
our net foreign currency investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into united states dollars using year end exchange rates was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the acquisitions of hirschmann  ltk and lumberg automation have increased our foreign currency translation risk 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used by us are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
the primary purpose of our commodity price management activities is to manage the volatility associated with purchases of commodities in the normal course of business 
we do not speculate on commodity prices 
we are exposed to price risk related to our purchase of copper used in the manufacture of our products 
our copper price management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as purchasing copper for future delivery at fixed prices 
where natural techniques are not possible  we will sometimes use commodity price derivatives  typically exchange traded forward contracts  with durations of generally twelve months or less 
we did not have any commodity price derivatives outstanding at december  and did not employ any commodity price derivatives during the year then ended 
the following table presents unconditional copper purchase obligations outstanding at december  the unconditional copper purchase obligations settle during in addition  we had million of copper included in our raw materials inventory balance at december  purchase fair amount value in thousands  except average price unconditional copper purchase obligations commitment volume in pounds weighted average price per pound commitment amounts we are also exposed to price risk related to our purchase of selected commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks used in the manufacture of our products 
we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices established with the vendors as part of the purchase process 
recent trends indicate that pricing of these commodities may become more volatile due to the increased prices of petrochemical feedstocks 
historically  we have not used commodity financial instruments to hedge prices for commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks 

table of contents interest rate risk we have occasionally managed our debt portfolio by using interest rate derivative instruments  such as swap agreements  to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates  however we were not a party to any interest rate derivative instruments at december  or during the year then ended 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the table also presents fair values as of december  principal amount by expected maturity thereafter total fair value in thousands  except interest rates fixed rate senior subordinated notes average interest rate fixed rate convertible subordinated debentures average interest rate total our convertible subordinated debentures traded at an average market price of per in face value on december  we believe the premium associated with these notes is attributable to factors such as changes in the price of our common stock rather than changes in interest rate 
the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments at december  represented of the carrying value of our fixed rate financial instruments 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments 
we anticipate  however  that counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these financial instruments 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world  and exposure is limited at any one financial institution 
although we do not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments  we do periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counterparty financial institutions 
at december   no individual customer represented or more of our trade accounts receivable outstanding
