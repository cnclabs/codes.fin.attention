item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those statements 
this discussion consists of the following sections executive overview a description of our business  financial highlights from  information about industry trends and sources of revenues and operating costs  critical accounting policies and estimates a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements  results of operations a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation  a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for  and  including comparisons between years and expectations for  and liquidity and capital resources a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity  an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  a discussion of our dividend policy and a summary of our contractual cash obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
executive overview we believe that we are one of the largest and most diversified television broadcasting companies in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements lmas or provide  or are provided  sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to television stations in markets 
for the purpose of this report  these stations are referred to as our stations 
we believe that owning duopolies and operating stations under lmas or providing sales and related services under outsourcing agreements enables us to accomplish two very important strategic business objectives increasing our share of revenues available in each market and operating television stations more efficiently by minimizing costs 
we constantly monitor revenue share and cost efficiencies and we aggressively pursue opportunities to improve both by using new technology and by sharing best practices among our station groups

the quarterly dividend rate per share increased again to cents per share on october   our retransmission consent agreements  including the advertising component  generated million in total net broadcast revenues during the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in  excluding political  local revenues increased and national revenues decreased during the year ended december  versus the same period in  in  interest expense decreased  primarily due to the full redemption of our notes and the partial redemption of our notes during  and market share survey results reflect that our stations share of the television advertising market in increased to  from in other highlights in january  we repurchased in the open market million face value of our senior subordinated notes  due on february   we purchased the non license assets of kfxa tv in cedar rapids  iowa for million in cash and the right to purchase licensed assets  pending fcc approval  for million

industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is elevated further due to the presidential election  the federal communications commission fcc has mandated that beginning february   all broadcast television stations must broadcast using only a digital signal and will no longer be able to broadcast using an analog signal  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream  a number of other broadcasters  including sinclair  have joined together in what is known as the open mobile video coalition to promote the development of mobile digital broadcasting applications 
we believe there is potential for broadcasters to garner payment for retransmission of their signals to mobile devices  retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from multi channel video programming distributors mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value provided by broadcasters  including digital and high definition signals and popular network programming  in addition to increased competition among video delivery providers  has generated a sustainable  annual payment stream which we expect to continue to grow  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues have been trending downward in recent years  many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers  seasonal advertising increases in the second and fourth quarters due to the advertising expenditures related to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  advertising revenue related to the olympics occurs in even numbered years and the super bowl is aired on a different network each year 
both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues  and compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has significantly declined in recent years and may be eliminated in the future in lieu of alternative network and affiliate relationships 
sources of revenues and costs most of our revenues are generated from the transactional spot market rather than the traditional up front and scatter markets that networks access 
these operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
during  we began to generate significant new revenues from our retransmission consent agreements 
these agreements have helped to produce a new  viable revenue stream that has replaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation while also significantly exceeding such previous sources of revenue 
while we expect revenues from our retransmission consent agreements to continue to grow over the next fiscal year and beyond  we do not expect the revenues to significantly increase  such as the increase from to  since most of our significant mvpds are now under contract 
however  as contracts expire we expect to negotiate favorable terms to grow our revenue stream 
in addition  most contracts contain automatic annual fee escalators 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency and national representatives commissions  are recognized in the period during which time spots are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that our agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase of the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately million 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
in conjunction with our nrv analysis of programming rights reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  we perform similar analysis on future programming rights yet to be reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and establish allowances when future payments exceed the estimated nrv 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis along with our goodwill 
we test our broadcast licenses and goodwill by estimating the fair market value of the broadcast licenses  or the net assets for each of our markets in the case of goodwill  using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings multiples paid for comparable television stations  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses and or goodwill could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relating to various federal and state net operating losses nol that are carried forward 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available federal and state nols 
we evaluate the need and extent of a valuation allowance based on the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book tax differences  alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  if there is a material change in our projected taxable income  or if there is a change in our ability to use nol carryforwards due to changes in federal and state laws  we will make any necessary adjustments to the valuation allowance 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  accruals are adjusted as necessary in accordance with the recognition provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
restructuring costs during the year ended december   we incurred costs in our broadcast segment associated with restructuring the news operations at certain of our stations 
specifically  on or before march   we ceased our locally produced news broadcasts in nine of our markets and  consequently  let go our news employees and cancelled our news related contracts 
we recorded restructuring charges in station production expenses 
as of december   there was no remaining unpaid balance related to the restructuring plan 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial standards accounting board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the fair value option established by this statement permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are to be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we currently have no plans to apply the option provisions of sfas to our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
this fsp amends fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the guidance in this fsp should be applied by companies upon the initial adoption of fin we adopted fin in  see note income taxes for more information 
this fsp and fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued the consensus on issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards 
the provisions require companies to recognize the tax benefits of dividends on unvested share based payments in equity and reclassify the tax benefits from additional paid in capital to the income statement when the related award is forfeited 
the provisions are effective prospectively starting january  the impact of this issue will not have a material effect to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fsp  apb a  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
this proposed fsp provides clarification on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement 
if issued  the guidance could significantly impact the accounting for instruments commonly referred to as instrument c  which is structured so that upon conversion  the principal amount of the obligation is paid in cash and the conversion spread is settled in cash or shares 
this proposed fsp would require the issuer to bifurcate a component of the debt and classify that component in shareholder s equity  then accrete the resulting discount on the debt resulting in interest expense equal to the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the expected effective date is for fiscal years beginning after january  and is required to be retroactively applied 
such a change in the accounting for convertible debt securities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas f  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this proposed fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of an intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangibles fas 
the fsp aims to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset as determined under fas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
 business combinations  and other applicable accounting literature 
as a result of this fsp  entities generally will be able to align the assumptions used for valuing an intangible asset with those used to determine its useful life 
this fsp will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r requires an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
in addition to new disclosure requirements  fas r also makes the following significant changes acquisition costs are expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingencies are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently re measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
this statement is effective for business combinations in which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas 
this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
changes in a parent s ownership interest that result in deconsolidation of a subsidiary will result in the recognition of a gain or loss in net income when the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
fas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the statement is effective for fiscals years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fsp fas and fsp fas  fair value measurements 
fsp fas amends fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas to exclude fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases fas  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions 
the fasb decided to exclude leasing transactions covered by fas except those arising from a business combination in order to allow it to more broadly consider the use of fair value measurements for these transactions as part of its project to comprehensively reconsider the accounting for leasing transactions 
fas delays the effective date of fas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the fsp states that the application of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities will be delayed until fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
fas was issued in september and defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for the year ended december  the application of fas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

see political revenues below for more information 
our largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net time sales were automotive  professional services  schools  paid programming  fast food and retail 
no other advertising category accounted for more than of our net time sales in along with the industry  we have seen softness in the automotive advertising category 
we conduct business with thousands of advertisers 
no advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated broadcast revenue in net broadcast revenues 
from a revenue category standpoint  the year ended december   when compared to  was impacted by a decrease in advertising revenues from political  retail  fast food  paid programming  movies and soft drinks  offset by increases in medical  media  telecommunications  services  cosmetics and home products 
automotive  our single largest category  representing of the year s net time sales  was down 
political revenues 
local and national political revenues were the primary drivers of higher revenue in  compared to and because was an election year 
for the year ended december   political revenues decreased by million to million when compared to the same period in we expect political revenues to increase in from levels  because is a presidential election year 
local revenues 
our revenues from local advertisers  excluding political revenues  increased during the last three years 
we continue to focus on increasing local advertising revenues through innovative sales and marketing strategies in our markets 
we continue to provide an enhanced sales training course for all of our salespeople with a focus on local revenue sales 
we expect to continue these efforts in local revenues excluding political increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to revenue from our fox affiliates which were up million in  a increase from offset by a decrease in revenue from our mynetworktv affiliates of million in  a decrease from national revenues 
our revenues from national advertisers  excluding political revenues  have continued to trend downward over time 
we believe this trend represents a shift in the way national advertising dollars are being spent and we believe this trend will continue in the future 
advertisers in major categories like automotive  soft drink and packaged goods have shifted significant portions of their advertising budgets away from spot television into non traditional media  in store promotions and product placement in network shows 
automotive decreases are due to automotive companies reducing advertising budgets and shifting advertising dollars to specific direct marketing areas 
we had decreases in national revenues  excluding political of million during the year ended december   when compared to the same period in more specifically in  the primary drivers to our decrease in national revenues were caused by a change in super bowl programming advertising revenues were million less than the same period in due to the shift in network affiliation that aired the super bowl from abc to cbs and weakness from our mynetworktv stations 
other revenues 
our other revenues consist primarily of revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi channel video programming distributors  network compensation  production revenues and revenues from our outsourcing agreements 
our retransmission consent agreements  including the advertising component  generated million in total broadcast revenues during compared with million in and million in this growth trend is the result of our ability to monetize our existing relationships as cable providers struggle with increased competition from alternative video delivery providers and have begun to recognize the value of our digital and high definition signals and network programming 
pursuant to eitf  during  million of the total million in revenues generated from our retransmission consent agreements are included in other revenues while the remaining million is included in net time sales

during  million of the total million in revenues generated from our retransmission consent agreements are included in other revenues while the remaining million is included in net time sales 
certain agreements are set to expire in and therefore  contractual negotiations are expected 
we expect to continue to generate revenues from retransmission consent agreements at terms as favorable as or more favorable than our existing agreements upon the expiration of those agreements 
our retransmission consent agreements include automatic annual fee escalators

station production expenses for increased compared to as a result of increases in programming expenses of million  engineering expenses of million  production expenses of million  news expenses of million  promotion expenses of million  rating service fees of million and music license fees of million

in addition  there was an increase in national representative commissions costs of million 
these increases were offset by decreases in traffic expense of million and sales expenses of million 
we expect station production and station selling  general and administrative expenses excluding barter to be up from amortization of program contract costs 
the amortization of program contract costs increased during compared to primarily due to an increase of million in write downs of our program contract costs partially offset by a decrease in program amortization of million 
the amortization increase during compared to was primarily due to significant program additions 
we expect program contract amortization expense to decrease in when compared to depreciation of property and equipment 
the depreciation of property and equipment decreased in compared to and in compared to these decreases are primarily related to assets becoming fully depreciated over time 
these decreases are offset by depreciation associated with capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect depreciation on property and equipment to increase in when compared to and capital expenditures are expected to be greater in corporate general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent the costs to operate our corporate headquarters location 
such costs include  among other things  corporate departmental salaries  bonuses  fringe benefits and other compensation  directors and officers life insurance  health and other insurance  rent  telephone  consulting fees  legal  accounting  director fees and strategic development initiatives 
corporate departments include executive  treasury  finance and accounting  human resources  technology  corporate relations  legal  sales  engineering  operations and purchasing 
corporate general and administrative expense for increased compared to the same period in due to increases in stock based compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights of million  restricted and unrestricted stock awards of million  investment consulting fees of million  the difference in the amount of workers compensation insurance refunds received in compared to amounting to million  increases in compensation expense of million  satellite costs of million  property insurance of million  director s fees of million and health care costs of million 
these increases were offset by decreases in legal fees of million  costs related to the shutdown of unprofitable local news programming at several stations in of million  building rent of million  and directors and officers insurance of million 
corporate general and administrative expense for increased compared to the same period in due to increases of million related to the shutdown of news central at several stations and other strategic development initiatives related to news  salary and bonus expense of million  legal fees of million  restricted and unrestricted stock compensation costs of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
these increases were offset by property and general insurance reimbursements of million  workers compensation refunds of million  decreases in health care costs of million and audit and accounting fees of million 
we expect corporate overhead expenses to increase in interest expense 
interest expense presented in the financial statements is related to continuing operations 
interest expense has been decreasing since  primarily due to refinancings we have undertaken 
the decrease during compared to is primarily due to the redemption of the senior subordinated notes  due the notes on january  and the partial redemption of the senior subordinated notes  due the notes on june  and june  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest on our revolving credit facility and term loan and interest on the convertible senior notes  due interest expense for decreased compared to the same period in due to the expiration of two interest rate swap agreements  a decrease of interest related to derivative instruments  and the repurchase of the notes 
the decrease was offset by increases due to the accretion of a debt discount as a result of the redemption of our series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for convertible debentures in the second quarter of and interest expense related to amended state income tax returns 
we expect interest expense to decrease in when compared to  assuming no changes in the current interest rate yield curve or changes in our assumption of debt levels for loss from extinguishment of debt 
in january and june  we redeemed and partially redeemed our notes and our notes  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
we account for our derivative instruments under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
for additional information on sfas  see note derivative instruments  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on april   we terminated two of our derivative instruments with a cash payment of million  the aggregate fair value of the derivative liabilities on that date 
these swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas and changes in their fair market values were reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt that was being hedged 
therefore  on the termination date  the carrying value of the underlying debt was adjusted to reflect the million payment and that amount will be treated as a discount on the underlying debt that was being hedged and will be amortized over its remaining life  in accordance with sfas amortization of the discount of million was recorded as interest expense for each of the years ended december  and on june   two of our derivative instruments expired 
these expired swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and  therefore  the changes in their fair market values were reflected in historical earnings as an unrealized gain from derivative instruments through the expiration date 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded an unrealized gain of million and million  respectively  related to these instruments 
as of december   we had two remaining derivative instruments 
both of these instruments are interest rate swap agreements 
one of these swap agreements  with a notional amount of million and expiring march   is accounted for as a fair value hedge  therefore  any changes in its fair market value are reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of our senior subordinated notes  due  which is the underlying debt being hedged 
during  the other interest rate swap agreement was undesignated as a fair value hedge due to a reassignment of the counterparty  therefore  any subsequent changes in the fair market value are reflected as an adjustment to income 
the notional amount of this swap agreement is million and it expires on march  the interest we pay on the million interest rate swap agreement is floating based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus and the interest we receive is 
the million swap is structured identically with the exception of a difference in the interest spread where it is 
the fair market value of these agreements is estimated by obtaining quotations from the international financial institution which is a party to the contract 
this fair value is an estimate of the net amount that we would pay on the balance sheet date if we cancelled the contracts or transferred them to other parties and includes net accrued interest receivable or payable 
this amount was a net asset of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during february  the counterparty to each of these two derivative instruments terminated the agreements 
to determine the sensitivity of these derivative instruments to changes in interest rates  we also obtain quotations from the party to the contract that estimate the pro forma fair market value of the instruments on december  if current interest rates were higher by or lower by 
as of december   the fair market value of these instruments would be a liability of million if interest rates were higher and an asset of million if interest rates were lower than current rates 
as of december   when including the effects of the above mentioned interest rate swaps  million or approximately of the face value of our debt effectively pays interest at a floating rate 
during may  we completed an issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes  due the notes 
during may  we completed an issuance of million aggregate principal of convertible senior notes  due the notes 
under certain circumstances  we will pay contingent cash interest to the holder of the convertible notes commencing on january  and may  for the notes and notes  respectively 
the contingent cash interest feature for both issuances are embedded derivatives which had a negligible fair value as of december  the embedded derivative for the notes had a negligible fair value as of december  on january   we redeemed in full our senior subordinated notes  due the notes using the proceeds from our million term loan a  borrowings under the revolver and cash on hand 
this transaction increases our risk to increases from interest rates as the term loan a and revolver both accrue interest with a variable rate 
on may   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes  due at an interest rate of per year 
upon certain conditions  the notes are convertible into cash and  in certain circumstances  shares of class a common stock prior to maturity at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment  which is equal to an initial conversion rate of approximately shares of class a common stock per  principal amount of notes 
under certain provisions of the indenture we may be required to pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes 
the notes may not be redeemed prior to may  and may thereafter be redeemed by us at par 
on may   the underwriters of the notes exercised their option to purchase up to an additional aggregate million principal amount of the notes 
the offering was made pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
for additional information  refer to note notes payable and commercial bank financing  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on june  and june   we partially redeemed million and million  respectively  of our existing senior subordinated notes  due the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest with net proceeds from the offering and cash on hand 
as a result of the partial redemption  we recorded a loss from extinguishment of debt of million representing the redemption premium and write off of certain debt acquisition costs  a debt premium and an unamortized derivative asset 
in addition to the partial redemption noted above  we repurchased on the open market million of our notes during the year ended december  as of december   the outstanding face amount of the notes was million 
during january  we repurchased on the open market million of our notes 
we are exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior subordinated notes totaling million  convertible senior notes totaling million  senior subordinated convertible notes totaling million and convertible senior notes totaling million expiring in the years   and  respectively 
based on the quoted market price  the fair value of these notes was billion as of december  generally  the fair market value of these notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of these notes by million as of december  the estimates related to the increase or decrease of interest rates are based on assumptions for forecasted future interest rates 
the transactions noted above decreased the fair value of our notes as of december  as compared to december  since the notes and the notes trade or traded at a premium and the notes trade at a discount 
in addition  the fair value of the term loan a which replaced a portion of the notes is not included in the fair value of our notes as of december
