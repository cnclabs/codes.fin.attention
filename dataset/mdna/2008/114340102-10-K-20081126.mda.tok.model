overview we are a leading provider of automation  vacuum and instrumentation solutions and are a highly valued business partner to original equipment manufacturers oem and equipment users throughout the world 
we serve markets where equipment productivity and availability is a critical factor for our customers success 
our largest served market is the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
we also provide unique solutions to customers in data storage  advanced display  analytical instruments and solar markets 
we develop and deliver differentiated solutions that range from proprietary products to highly respected manufacturing services 
on march   we completed the sale of our software division  brooks software  to applied materials  inc applied for cash consideration and the assumption of certain liabilities related to brooks software 
brooks software provided real time applications for greater efficiency and productivity in collaborative  complex manufacturing environments 
we transferred to applied substantially all of our assets primarily related to brooks software  including the stock of several subsidiaries engaged only in the business of brooks software  and applied assumed certain liabilities related to brooks software 
we sold our software division in order to focus on our core semiconductor related hardware businesses 
we recognized a gain on disposal of the software division 
effective october   our consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to reflect this business as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made changes to our internal reporting structure and began reporting results in three segments automation systems  critical components and global customer operations 
in the second quarter of fiscal these segment disclosures were refined to reflect the results of a comprehensive review of operations conducted subsequent to the appointment of a new ceo and cfo 
these refinements resulted in minor changes to the previously disclosed split of revenues and gross margins among segments and between products and services 
our automation systems segment provides a range of wafer handling products and systems that support both atmospheric and vacuum process technology used by our customers 
our critical components operations segment includes cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement products used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
our global customer operations segment consists of our after market activities including an extensive range of service support to our customers to address their on site needs  spare parts and repair services  and support of legacy product lines 
certain reclassifications have been made in the and consolidated financial statements to conform to the presentation 
the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical  resulting in periodic expansions and contractions 
demand for our products has been impacted by these cyclical industry conditions 
during fiscal and throughout most of fiscal  we benefited from an industry expansion 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to observe a contraction in the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
the length and severity of these downturns can be difficult to predict 
recent developments we have experienced changes in our senior management team during fiscal year including the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer  robert j 
lepofsky  on october   and the appointment of a new chief financial officer  martin s 
headley  on january  our new management 
table of contents team embarked on a review of our organizational structure and resource requirements  which resulted in restructuring charges during fiscal year in fiscal  our total revenues decreased from fiscal by to million 
our revenue by segment for fiscal and is as follows in thousands for the year ended september  automation systems critical components global customer operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to observe a slowdown in the demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
this slowdown continued throughout fiscal year based on discussions with our customer base  and external market forecasts  we had expected a material improvement in demand for semiconductor capital equipment during based on recent communications with our semiconductor customers  and revised external market forecasts  we now believe that demand for our products will decline further as a result of the global economic slowdown 
this abrupt change in our outlook has resulted in an expectation of lower cash flows from all three of our operating segments  which has led to an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets of million as of september  in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down certain buildings and leasehold improvements to fair value as of september  in response to the weakness in demand  we have begun an analysis of our cost structure and expect to make further significant cost reductions during due to the preliminary stage of this analysis  we cannot yet predict the cost or benefit of this restructuring effort 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenues are associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
in the limited 
table of contents situations where the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from repair services or upgrades of customer owned equipment is recognized upon completion of the repair effort and upon the shipment of the repaired item back to the customer 
in instances where the repair or upgrade includes installation  revenue is recognized when the installation is completed 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we use the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our reporting units by measuring discounted cash flows to the book value of the reporting units and measure impairment  if any  as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value of the goodwill 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
we have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as required under fas on september of each fiscal year 
during this process  estimates of revenue and expense were developed for each of our reporting units based on internal as well as external market forecasts 
our analyses indicated no impairment of the goodwill in fiscal and although we experienced a cyclical slowdown in demand during fiscal  external market forecasts available to us throughout this period indicated that demand would improve in these external market forecasts changed abruptly toward the end of fiscal and again into early fiscal the downturn experienced in the semiconductor capital equipment market during has been worsened by the global economic slowdown 
we do not expect a recovery in demand for semiconductor capital equipment in the near term 
this abrupt change in our outlook has resulted in an expectation of lower cash flows from all three of our operating segments  which has led to an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets of million as of september  the determination of the amount of an impairment includes a number of judgments including the determination of peer companies  which are used to determine discount rates and terminal value factors 
we also construct multi year cash flow forecasts for each segment  which are discounted to present value using the predetermined discount rate 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience by customer 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in accordance with sfas  management has considered the weight of all available evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance remains to be required against its deferred tax assets at september  given the losses incurred in fiscal combined with the near term uncertainty with regard to the outlook of the semiconductor sector  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
we continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
stock based compensation as of october   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock on the date of grant  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas  as amended by sfas such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
restricted stock with market based vesting criteria is valued using a lattice model 

table of contents year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the total decrease in revenues of million impacted all of our operating segments 
our automation systems segment revenues decreased by million  our critical components segment revenues decreased by million and our global customer operations segment revenues decreased by million 
these decreases were the result of lower volume shipments in response to declining demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
we expect the volume of shipments to further decline in the near term in response to the global economic slowdown 
our automation systems segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   a decrease of from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to weaker demand for semiconductor capital equipment and impacted all product lines within this segment 
our critical components segment reported revenues of million  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease principally reflects lower revenues of million for cryogenic vacuum pumping  including a one time royalty license of million recorded in the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased revenue from non semiconductor industry related customers 
our global customer operations segment reported revenues of million  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to lower legacy product revenue of million  lower service contract and repair revenues of million and lower spare part revenue of million 
service contract and repair revenues  which include spare parts  were million  a decrease from million in the prior year 
all service revenues are related to our global customer operations segment 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
gross margin gross margin dollars decreased to million for the year ended september   a decrease of from million for the year ended september  gross margin for both periods included million of completed technology amortization related to the acquisitions of helix technology corporation in october and synetics solutions inc in june gross margin percentage decreased to for the year ended september   compared to for the prior year  primarily due to the lower absorption of indirect factory overhead on lower revenues 
gross margin of our automation systems segment decreased to million in the year ended september   a decrease of from million for the year ended september  gross margin included million in both years for completed technology amortization related to the synetics acquisition 
gross margin percentage decreased to for the year ended september  as compared to in the prior year  primarily due to lower absorption of indirect factory overhead on lower revenues 
gross margin of our critical components segment decreased to million in the year ended september   a decrease of from million in the prior year 
gross margin for both periods included million of completed technology amortization related to the helix acquisition 
gross margin for the prior year includes an million one time royalty license 
gross margin percentage was for the year ended september  as compared to in the prior year 
this decrease is the result of the one time royalty license in the prior year which increased the prior year gross margin percentage by 
effective cost containment efforts for this segment offset the impact of lower absorption of factory overhead on lower revenues 
gross margin of our global customer operations segment decreased to million in the year ended september   a decrease of from the million in the prior year 
gross margin for both periods included million of completed technology amortization related to the helix acquisition 
gross 
table of contents margin percentage was for the year ended september  as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was attributable to reduced margin on legacy product sales caused primarily by charges to write down legacy product inventory to net realizable value  and an under utilization of our service infrastructure 
in response to these declining gross margins  we have reduced the size of our service infrastructure  and expect to make additional cost reductions 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september   were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
while there is continued support for high priority projects  we did experience lower spending of million associated with automation systems product development with certain development cycles coming to completion 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in management incentive costs  a million decrease in legal fees primarily as a result of the settlement of stockholder litigation and a million reduction in stock based compensation expense mainly due to the departure of certain executives 
in connection with our implementation of the oracle erp system  we treat certain internal labor costs as part of the cost to implement this system 
these costs  along with third party consulting fees and software licenses are treated as capital expenditures  and will be depreciated over the useful life of this system 
during fiscal  we increased the amount of labor costs capitalized for our oracle project by million  with an offsetting reduction to our selling  general and administrative expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by million of higher intangible asset amortization 
impairment charges we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the year ended september  we experienced a cyclical slowdown in demand during fiscal throughout most of fiscal  external market forecasts indicated that demand would improve in these external market forecasts changed abruptly at the end of fiscal and into early fiscal the downturn experienced in the semiconductor capital equipment market during has been worsened by the global economic slowdown 
we do not expect a recovery in demand for semiconductor capital equipment in the near term 
this abrupt change in our outlook has resulted in an expectation of lower cash flows from all three of our operating segments  which has led to a non cash impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets of million as of september  in addition  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to write down certain buildings and leasehold improvements to fair value as of september  restructuring charges we recorded a charge to continuing operations of million in the year ended september  this charge consists of million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions of employees in operations  service and administrative functions across all the main geographies in which we operate 
we also incurred million of costs to vacate excess facilities in san jose  california and south korea 
our restructuring charges by segment for fiscal were global customer operations million  automated systems million and critical components million 
in addition  we incurred million of restructuring charges in fiscal that were related to general corporate functions that support all of our segments 
the accruals for workforce reductions are expected to be paid over the next twelve months 
we expect the annual salary and benefit savings as a result of these actions will be approximately million 
the cost savings resulting from these restructuring actions are expected to yield actual cash savings  net of the related costs  within twelve months 
we are expanding our cost reduction efforts in response to the global economic slowdown and expect to take further restructuring charges during fiscal 
table of contents we recorded a restructuring charge to continuing operations of million in the year ended september  this charge consists of million to fully recognize our remaining obligation on the lease associated with our vacant facility in billerica  massachusetts  along with million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions of approximately employees in operations  service and administrative functions principally in the us  germany and korea 
interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million for the prior year 
approximately million of this decrease is due to lower investment balances as a result of repurchases of our common stock during the first and second quarters of fiscal  with the balance of the decrease attributable to lower interest rates on our investments 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended september  as compared to million in the prior year 
interest expense relates primarily to discounting of multi year restructuring costs 
gain loss on investment during the three months ended june   a company in which brooks held a minority equity interest was acquired by a closely held swiss public company 
our minority equity investment had been previously written down to zero in as a result  we received shares of common stock from the acquirer in exchange for our minority equity interest and recorded a gain of million 
during the year ended september   we recorded a charge of million to write down our minority equity investment in the swiss public company to its fair value based on our determination that the decline in fair value was other than temporary 
the remaining balance of this investment at september  after giving effect to foreign exchange was million 
other income expense other expense  net of million for the year ended september  consists of foreign exchange losses of million  which was partially offset by royalty income of million  the receipt of million of principal repayments on notes that had been previously written off and other income of million 
other expense  net of million for the year ended september  consisted of foreign exchanges losses of million  offset by the receipt of million of principal repayment on two notes that had been previously written off 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal and is principally attributable to alternative minimum tax and taxes on foreign income 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on october  the implementation of fin no 
did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
of the unrecognized tax benefits of million at september   we currently anticipate that approximately million will be paid in settlement during the next twelve months as a result of finalizing certain non us audits 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million in the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year 
income associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with 
table of contents yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for the year ended september  as compared to million in the prior year 
discontinued operations we completed the sale of our software division to applied materials on march  during the year ended september   we settled all remaining escrow items resulting in an additional gain of million 
we recorded income from the operation of our discontinued software business of million for the year ended september  we recorded a gain of million in the second quarter of fiscal year on the sale of our discontinued software business 
this gain reflects the proceeds of million of cash consideration  offset by expenses of million  a tax provision of million  and the write off of net assets totaling million 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the increase reflects higher revenues related to our automation systems segment of million  higher revenues associated with our critical components segment of million  and higher revenues associated with our global customer operations segment of million due primarily to higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment experienced in fiscal our automation systems segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   an increase of from million in the prior year 
this increase reflects the additional revenues of million related to the synetics acquisition  along with higher revenues related to our legacy brooks automation products due to higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment experienced in fiscal our critical components segment reported revenues of million  a increase from million in the prior year 
this increase reflects higher revenues of million for cryogenic vacuum pumping including incremental product license revenues of million experienced in the third quarter of fiscal  higher revenues of million associated with thermal measurement products  and million of additional revenues for vacuum measurement and air flow control products 
our global customer operations segment reported revenues of million  a increase from million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributed to higher revenues of million related to repairs  higher revenues of million for hardware maintenance and field services  offset by lower revenues for hardware spares of million 
the increase in hardware maintenance and field services revenue is due in part to the synetics acquisition  which increased service revenue by million 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased to million for the year ended september   compared to million for the prior year 
gross margin for the year ended september  includes million of completed technology amortization related to the helix and synetics acquisitions 
the prior year gross margin includes million of charges to write off the step up in inventory related to the helix and synetics acquisitions and million of completed technology amortization 
gross margin percentage decreased to for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september   primarily due to the lower margin on the additional synetics revenues 
excluding the million inventory write off taken in fiscal year and the amortization of completed technology  the overall increase in gross margin primarily reflects the additional margin associated with our automation systems segment of million  higher margin associated with our critical components segment of million  and higher margin associated with our global customer operations segment of million due primarily to higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment experienced in fiscal 
table of contents gross margin of our automation systems segment increased to million in the year ended september   and included million of completed technology amortization related to the synetics acquisition  compared to million in the prior year which included million of charges to write off the step up in inventory and million of completed technology amortization related to the synetics acquisition

we recorded a charge to continuing operation of million in the year ended september  this charge consisted of million of excess facilities charges primarily related to a vacant facility in billerica massachusetts due to a longer period than initially estimated to sub lease the facility  million for costs incurred related to the termination of approximately employees worldwide whose positions were made redundant as a result of the helix acquisition  offset by the million reversal of previously accrued termination costs to employees who will no longer be terminated or whose termination was settled at a reduced cost 
we recorded a charge of million in fiscal year for workforce reductions related to our discontinued software division which is included in the loss from discontinued operations 
interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this decrease is due primarily to lower investment balances following the repayment of million of the convertible subordinated notes in the quarter ended september   and the purchase of  shares of our common stock in the quarter ended september  for a total cost of approximately million 
we recorded interest expense of million in fiscal year compared to million in the previous year 
the interest expense incurred in the prior year related primarily to the convertible subordinated notes that were paid off in the quarter ended september  gain on investment during the three months ended june   a company in which brooks held a minority equity interest was acquired by a closely held swiss public company 
our minority equity investment had been previously written down to zero in as a result  we received shares of common stock from the acquirer in exchange for our minority equity interest and recorded a gain of million

income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal and is principally attributable to alternative minimum tax and taxes on foreign income 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 

table of contents equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million in the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year 
we also recorded income of million associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan that began operations on september  discontinued operations we completed the sale of our software division to applied materials on march  we recorded income from the operation of our discontinued software business of million for the year ended september   compared to income of million associated with this business for the year ended september  this favorable change is primarily the result of reduced research and development and sg a spending  lower amortization of completed technology and the recognition of a tax benefit resulting from the reversal of tax reserves due to an audit settlement  offset by lower margin on lower revenues for six months of operations in fiscal vs 
twelve months in fiscal we recorded a gain of million in the second quarter of fiscal year on the sale of our discontinued software business 
this gain reflects the proceeds of million of cash consideration  offset by expenses of million  a tax provision of million  and the write off of net assets totaling million 
we recorded income from operations for our discontinued specialty equipment and life sciences sels business of million for the year ended september  the income in fiscal year relates to maintenance revenues earned during the year that had previously been deferred 
there was no activity associated with this discontinued business in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oems that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
in response to these downturns  we have and are continuing to implement cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives include consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount and reduced spending 
the cyclical nature of the industry make estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to million for treasury share purchases and million of capital equipment expenditures  which were partially offset by million in cash provided by operations and million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september   and was primarily attributable to million of income after adjusting our net loss for non cash expenses  including depreciation and amortization of million  asset impairment of million  stock based compensation of million  and other non cash items of million 
cash provided by operations was further increased by million of changes in working capital which was primarily due to decreased accounts receivable balances of million and lower prepaid expenses of million which was partially offset by lower accounts payable levels of million and decreased accrued expenses of million due to the decreased level of our business 
our change in working capital was partially offset by an increased investment of million in field service inventory in order to improve customer response time for service transactions 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended september   and is principally comprised of net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million  the final escrow proceeds of million from applied materials for the sale of our software division  which have been partially offset by million in capital expenditures  including million in expenditures related to our oracle erp implementation  and the final contingent payment of million in connection with our keystone wuxi acquisition 
our oracle erp implementation is expected to cost approximately million when fully implemented  of which million has been incurred from inception through september  we completed the financial module portion of the oracle erp implementation during fiscal  and placed in service million of oracle erp costs 
the remaining million of costs incurred to date is included in construction in progress within property  plant and equipment 
we will continue to make capital expenditures to support and maintain our operations  and may also use our resources to acquire companies  technologies or products that complement our business

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as of october  as of september   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was million 
although we anticipate that we will settle approximately million of the million within the next twelve months  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the remaining million as to when cash settlement  if any  will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolution of those examinations is uncertain

on november  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to buy up to million of our outstanding common stock 
during the year ended september   we purchased  shares of our common stock for a total of million in connection with the stock repurchase plan 
management and the board of directors will exercise discretion with respect to the timing and amount of any future shares repurchased  if any  based on their evaluation of a variety of factors  including current market conditions 
repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
the repurchase program has been funded using our available cash resources 
any future repurchases would come from our available cash resources 
we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both the short and long term 
however  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the current global economic downturn makes it difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
during the current capital market crisis  some companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash in highly rated marketable securities  and to date  we have not experienced any material issues accessing our funds 
further deterioration in the capital markets could impact our ability to access some of our cash resources 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we are subject to indemnification obligations in connection with our stock based compensation restatement with certain former executives which could have an adverse affect on our existing resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure as our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
our short term and long term investments consist mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities  and as such  market risk to these investments is not significant 
during the year ended september   the unrealized loss on marketable securities  excluding our investment in a swiss public company  was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
currency rate exposure we have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros and a variety of asian currencies 
sales in currencies other than the us dollar were of our total sales for year ended september  we also purchase materials from some suppliers outside of the united states that is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar

the impact of a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates at september  is not considered material
