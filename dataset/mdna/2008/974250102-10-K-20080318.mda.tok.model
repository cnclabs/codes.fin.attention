we believe that the combination of our cash on hand  the cash generated from our franchising business  cash generated from discounting sources  our bank line of credit as well as our renewable subordinated unsecured notes  will be adequate to fund our planned operations  including leasing activity  for critical accounting policies the company prepares the consolidated financial statements of winmark corporation and subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies that we believe are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition royalty revenue and franchise fees the company collects royalties from each retail franchise based on a percentage of retail store gross sales 
the company recognizes royalties as revenue when earned 
at the end of each accounting period  estimates of royalty amounts due are made based on applying historical weekly sales information to the number of weeks of unreported franchisee sales 
if there are significant changes in the actual performances of franchisees versus our estimates  our royalty revenue would be impacted 
during  we collected  more than our estimate at december  as of december   our royalty receivable was  the company collects initial franchise fees when franchise agreements are signed and recognizes the initial franchise fees as revenue when the franchise is opened  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
franchise fees collected from franchisees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   our deferred franchise fees were  stock based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include implied volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on our historical volatility rate  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
our decision to use historical volatility was based upon the lack of actively traded options on our common stock 
we estimate the expected term based upon historical option exercises 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates for the volatility period 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted  we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the vesting periods 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value awards on an annual basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income  net income and earnings per share 
impairment of long term investments on an annual basis  the company evaluates its long term investments for impairment 
the impairment  if any  is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices  discounted cash flow analysis or other financial metrics that management utilizes to help determine fair value 
judgments made by management related to the fair value of its long term investments are affected by factors such as the ongoing financial performance of the investees  additional capital raised by the investees as well as general changes in the economy 
leasing income recognition leasing income is recognized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method of income recognition applies a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease 
generally  when a lease is days or more delinquent  the lease is classified as being on non accrual and the company stops recognizing leasing income on that date 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at an amount that it believes to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our existing lease portfolio as of the reporting dates 
a provision is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the appropriate level 
if the actual results are different from the company s estimates  our results could be different 
the company policy is to charge off against the allowance the estimated unrecoverable portion of accounts once they reach days delinquent
