item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  of this report 
our principal markets include the market for secure web gateway products  and the newly evolving wan application delivery market  which includes products that both enhance wan security and wan performance  and improve the availability of business applications  where network users are distributed across multiple locations 
our primary end user customers are medium and large distributed organizations  including finance  government  healthcare  education and other business enterprises 
enterprises deploy our products in their data centers  branch offices  and internet gateways and mobile devices worldwide 
we were incorporated in delaware on march  as web appliance inc we changed our name to cacheflow  inc 
on march   and completed our initial public offering on november  on august   we changed our name to blue coat systems  inc  and our ticker symbol for our common stock from cflo to bcsi 
on september   we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation  implementing a one for five reverse split of our outstanding common stock 
our common stock began trading under the split adjustment at the opening of the nasdaq stock market on september  on august   our board of directors approved a two for one forward stock split of our common stock 
the stock split was effected by the issuance of a stock dividend of one share of our common stock for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date of september  our common stock began trading under that split adjustment at the opening of the nasdaq global market on october  in january  we commenced trading on the nasdaq global select market 
our number of authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock has remained at million and million  respectively  since our incorporation 
all share and per share amounts in this annual report on form k  and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  reflect the reverse stock split and subsequent forward split for all periods presented 
overview during the past few years  certain trends have fundamentally changed the basic architecture of the corporate enterprise network and the way users and applications communicate across a distributed enterprise 
the number of enterprise branch offices and mobile network users has continued to increase 
as a result  a growing number of employees  and in some cases the majority of an enterprise s employees  now work outside the corporate headquarters  or away from its data centers 

table of contents data centers  servers  storage and applications are increasingly being consolidated at enterprise headquarters in order to reduce costs  optimize use of resources  better safeguard critical business information  and comply with new regulatory requirements requiring greater control over it systems 
as a result  a growing number of users must now connect securely and efficiently to the enterprise headquarters through a wan to access the business applications and business information systems required to be productive 
there is an increasing number of threats to the security and availability of corporate networks  including those resulting from malicious code  viruses  trojans  spam  spyware  and the use of instant messaging 
most business applications are designed to perform optimally over a local area network lan and are not designed or architected to be accessed over a wan 
as a consequence  these applications  although often critical to the enterprise  perform very inefficiently and slowly when used by remote and mobile users 
in addition  other commonly used applications  such as web protocols  video streaming  and secure sockets layer ssl  consume large amounts of bandwidth  causing further degradation of application performance for the remote and mobile users of a corporate network 
where employees do not experience an acceptable level of network performance  their productivity may suffer and they may even cease to use an application altogether 
many companies are now outsourcing one or more critical business applications  such as customer relationship management or crm  enterprise resource planning or erp  human resources  and procurement applications 
in such circumstances  the application is hosted remotely by the service provider and is typically accessed through the internet 
since corporate it organizations do not control these applications or the internet  it is more difficult to ensure that these applications perform well and are secure  especially for remote and mobile users 
the web browser is becoming the ubiquitous user interface for many applications  and provides virtually all users of a corporate network with access to the web itself 
the amount of internet traffic on the corporate wan has increased dramatically 
as a consequence of this evolution  it organizations must address three distinct requirements to ensure that all network users remain productive they must be able to block internet security threats and inappropriate content  prevent leakage of sensitive information  and grant authorized users timely access to necessary applications and content 
they must significantly improve the performance of critical business applications being delivered to remote users in branch offices and to mobile users 
these applications can include erp  crm  and productivity and office applications  e mail  file systems  streaming media  and web based applications  including encrypted ssl applications 
they must be able to monitor the specific activities and performance of users and applications  as well as be able to implement and enforce access and security policies  to ensure that the business is providing an acceptable and cost effective level of application performance and network security for all users  including those located outside of enterprise headquarters 
we offer a family of appliances and software products that assist it organizations in addressing the challenges of the distributed enterprise and meeting the above requirements 
these appliances and software help secure and accelerate application delivery to all users connected over a private wan or the public internet  regardless of whether the applications are hosted internally or externally 
our blue coat proxysg  proxyav  and proxyra appliances  and our blue coat proxysg client software  are available in a wide range of configurations and work together as a centrally managed  policy controlled system that is sufficiently flexible to be scaled to support large complex organizations 

table of contents secure web gateway solutions during the past several years  our primary business focus has been to offer proxy appliances used to control and secure communications for users of a corporate network accessing content on the internet 
these appliances are located at the customer s internet gateway  which is the point where the network connects to the internet 
the performance of our proxy appliances has enabled us to establish a leadership position in the market for secure web gateway products 
one of the key strengths of our appliances is our advanced proxy technology 
our proxy appliance acts as a middleman between users and various applications or internet content 
users communicate with the proxy appliance on one side of the transaction  and applications and internet content communicate with the proxy appliance on the other side of the transaction 
there are two separate connections  both controlled and managed by the proxy appliance 
consequently  no content can get past the appliance unless it is in accordance with a policy that is created by the customer s it organization and that is automatically enforced by the appliance 
this enables our proxy appliances to protect businesses from many of the dangers of the internet 
our appliances offer a number of important features that enable more secure communication with the internet  including web content filtering the ability to allow or block specific types of web content from entering the corporate network 
the use of web content filtering can prevent potential security breaches and can block employees from viewing inappropriate content when using the company s computer system 
web anti virus av protection the ability to automatically scan and block viruses and other potentially malicious network traffic using leading third party anti virus products 
spyware prevention the ability to prevent installation of spyware and other malicious code on individual user computers  and eliminate that as a cause of performance problems and security vulnerabilities 
instant messaging im and skype control the ability to prevent these types of peer to peer pp applications from creating an opportunity for leakage of sensitive  confidential information  as well as managing im content and blocking inappropriate use of such applications 
prevention of rogue streaming media applications the ability to limit or block the use of unauthorized pp applications  which often degrade network performance  by network users 
ssl threat protection the ability to identify and block threats presented by the use of the ssl  or secure sockets layer  protocol 
while use of ssl improves security by encrypting confidential data communicated over the internet  it may also provide a means for hidden viruses  worms  and other security threats to enter the network 
user authentication the ability to automatically validate a user who requests access to secure corporate content 
our appliances interface with virtually all leading authentication systems  including nt lan manager  radius  ldap and active directory  to provide user validation 
wide area network application delivery solutions during fiscal  we extended our focus to address the need to improve performance and availability of critical business applications delivered across the wan to remote and mobile users commonly known as wan optimization or wan acceleration  while simultaneously securing the delivery of those applications and content 
this market has been defined by idc  a leading provider of it market intelligence services  as the wan application delivery market 
our wan application delivery products are delivered by the same proxy appliances that enable our secure web gateway products 
our mach multiprotocol accelerated caching hierarchy technology  which is 
table of contents integrated into our appliances  provides five key capabilities that accelerate the delivery of business applications to remote users of a wan  including bandwidth management the ability to assign a set level of bandwidth to specific users and applications and prioritize delivery of that traffic over the wan 
protocol optimization a technique that enhances the efficiency of protocols by reducing the communication required between the user and the application 
object caching a technique where reusable content is stored on the appliance which eliminates the need to repeatedly transfer that information across the wan 
byte caching a technique that assigns  stores and uses abbreviated expressions that represent repetitive wan traffic  which conserves bandwidth and accelerates delivery of the application 
compression a technique that uses an industry standard algorithm to package and unpackage information for efficient transmission across a wan 
our mach technology is also designed to improve the performance of business applications  including streaming video  encrypted ssl applications  and applications hosted by third parties and accessed through the internet 
our appliances are deployed in both the centralized data centers and in the branch office 
in addition  we make mach functionality available as client based software in our sg client for users requiring accelerated application performance while working outside of the corporate network 
products as of april   we offered the following products proxysg appliances our blue coat proxysg family of proxy appliances serves as the foundation for both our secure web gateway products and our wan application delivery products 
the appliance  when appropriately configured  may be placed at the internet gateway  to provide security with respect to web based communications  or may be placed at connection points for entry to or exit from a wan or wan links to enhance and accelerate the performance of business applications over that wan 
proxysg appliances are designed for simple management and installation by our customers  and easily integrate with the customer s existing security and network infrastructure 
they are icsa certified and are available in four different models 
our proxysg appliances use our proprietary sgos operating system  which is specifically designed to support the security  acceleration  and policy control features of those appliances 
they are available in a broad range of configurations to support all network users in an organization  regardless of their physical location 
proxysg client our blue coat proxysg client is software that is installed on a desktop or laptop computer that is located at a remote site without a proxysg appliance or that is used by a mobile user 
the software uses our mach technology  including caching  compression and protocol optimization  to accelerate the delivery of web and office applications used by these remote computers 
this provides the user with performance that is similar to that provided by a large wan that uses a proxysg appliance 

table of contents proxyav appliances our blue coat proxyav family of web anti virus appliances enable organizations to scan for viruses  worms  spyware and trojans at the internet gateway before permitting communications to enter the enterprise s network 
such infected communications frequently arrive through so called backdoors  such as personal web email accounts  web spam or email spam that activates trojan downloads without the user s consent  and browser based file downloads that bypass existing virus scanning mechanisms 
a proxyav appliance  when implemented in combination with a proxysg appliance  provides scalable virus scanning  and also provides the it administrator with comprehensive visibility and control of enterprise web communications 
the proxyav appliance uses virus scanning software from such vendors as sophos  mcafee  symantec  panda  and kaspersky lab 
proxyra appliances our blue coat proxyra appliances are installed at the headquarters of an enterprise and enable authorized mobile users to securely connect to a corporate network through a mobile client device such as a laptop  pda or airport kiosk computer 
our proxyra appliances use application independent proxy architecture and proprietary connector technology to provide the following features on demand access to web and non web applications without the need to install virtual private network vpn or other special software on the client device 
comprehensive support for client devices not managed by the enterprise s it department  including features to block inadvertent or malicious information leakage to or from the client device 
integrated security services with respect to communications between the corporate network and the client device  including monitoring for encryption and spyware and implementing policy based controls 
blue coat webfilter our blue coat webfilter is a web filtering product that operates on our proxysg appliances and helps enterprises and service providers protect their users and networks from internet threats and inappropriate content and traffic  such as adult content  spyware  phishing attacks  pp traffic  im and streaming traffic 
our webfilter product includes a comprehensive database that is organized into relevant and useful categories 
the webfilter database continues to be developed and enhanced in response to the actual web usage patterns of customers  including through use of our dynamic real time rating drtr technology  which enables us to categorize web sites that are not in our database  but to which a user sought access 
in addition to our proprietary webfilter product  our proxysg appliances also support the use of third party content filtering databases  including those offered by secure computing corporation and websense  inc blue coat reporter blue coat reporter uses transaction log data captured by an appliance to produce both pre defined and custom reports relating to the performance and security of user activities on the enterprise s wan 
the information in these reports can be used by the it administrator to appropriately adjust policies or take other actions to enhance the security or performance of the wan 
blue coat director blue coat director is an appliance that provides centralized management of an enterprise s blue coat proxysg appliances 

table of contents sales and marketing our products are delivered to end user customers in many countries worldwide 
we also maintain a worldwide service and support organization that provides a broad range of service options to our customers  including x technical support and product education 
our worldwide sales strategy is based upon the use of multiple methods and sales tiers to market and sell our products 
we maintain a direct sales organization of highly skilled sales representatives and systems engineers 
they are assigned to general territories covering defined geographic areas and to territories focused on a select number of large enterprise customers  or named accounts 
our direct sales organization is complemented by a large channel of third party resellers and distributors 
our resellers are responsible for identifying and closing business on an independent basis 
our resellers are supported by our global distributors  many of whom provide education  co marketing  demonstration equipment and support to our end user customers  and our internal channel sales specialists 
during fiscal  one customer  a distributor  accounted for of our net revenue 
within each geographic area we also have a team of sales and technical specialists focused on the development of relationships with  and sales to  service providers and value added resellers 
we employ a team of inside sales representatives in each geographic area to support both the direct sales organization and channel partners 
the primary function of our inside sales representatives is to develop and qualify leads identified from our marketing activities and to forward those leads to the appropriate sales channel 
our marketing efforts focus on increasing the awareness of our blue coat brand  educating the market on issues and challenges associated with wan application delivery and secure web gateway products  and creating demand for our products and technology 
we develop marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and to inform existing and potential customers within our target market segments about the capabilities and benefits of our products 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows  informational seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  maintenance of our web site  advertising  public relations  and collateral solution documentation and enablement 
in addition  we provide similar types of marketing support for our major sales channel partners worldwide 
research and development we believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our continued success and growth 
our current research and development efforts are primarily focused on adding new features and strengthening existing features that extend the acceleration and security capabilities of our wan application delivery products and enhancing the reliability  ease of use and installation and support of those products 
at the same time  we are continuing to enhance the capabilities of our secure web gateway products by adding new features and strengthening existing features 
our research and development team consists of engineers with extensive technical backgrounds in relevant disciplines 
we believe that the experience and capabilities of our research and development professionals is one of our significant competitive advantages 
we also work closely with our customers to understand their business needs and to focus our development of new products and product enhancements to better meet customer needs 
while we anticipate that most enhancements to our existing and future products will be accomplished by internal development  we currently license certain technologies from third parties and will continue to evaluate externally developed products and technology for integration into our products 
as well  we have acquired third party businesses  technologies and products to expand our capabilities and market  and may continue to do so in the future 

table of contents research and development expense was million  million  and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively  including stock based compensation expense attributable to our research and development organization of million  million  and million  respectively 
manufacturing we currently outsource the manufacturing of our appliances and principally use standard parts and components that are available from multiple vendors 
this approach allows us to reduce our investment in manufacturing equipment  facilities  and inventory  and to take advantage of the expertise of our vendors 
we rely primarily on two original design manufacturers and one business service process partner to assist in the design of our products and to manufacture and test our products 
we have contracted with mitac international corporation to design and manufacture our current product offerings and have contracted with synnex corporation to do final assembly and testing of those products 
we also have contracted with inventec enterprise system corporation to design and manufacture certain new high performance products that are not yet commercially available 
all of these agreements are non exclusive 
our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of project management  prototype development  materials and production planning  quality and reliability assurance and procurement as required in support of our relationships with our outsourced manufacturing partners 
backlog our backlog is comprised of amounts for orders that we have accepted  but not shipped  and deferred revenue 
deferred revenue includes revenue from products that have shipped to distributors  but have not yet shipped to end customers  product shipments that do not yet qualify as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  and the unearned portion of service and maintenance contracts 
our backlog was approximately million at april  as compared to million at april   which represented an increase of million 
the deferred revenue portion of our backlog increased by million  primarily as a result of an increase in new service contracts sold with our appliances  as well as the renewal of service contracts  while our backlog of orders accepted  but not shipped  declined by million due primarily to a decline in the growth rate of our north american business in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  due to occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders prior to shipment which can be made without significant penalty  we do not believe this backlog to be firm or that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter  which we believe reflects customer buying patterns of products similar to ours and other products in the technology industry generally 
competition we are a market leader in the secure internet web market  although we may face increased competition in this market given recent consolidations 
our principal competitors in this market are secure computing corporation  through its acquisitions of cyberguard corp 
and ciphertrust  inc  and websense  inc  through its acquisition of portauthority technologies  inc and surfcontrol plc  and cisco systems  inc through its acquisition of ironport 
we commercially released our first wan application delivery product in may this is a market that is intensely competitive  and it is evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
our principal competitors in this market are riverbed technology  inc  juniper networks  inc  cisco systems  inc and citrix systems  inc 
through its acquisition of orbital data corp 
in addition  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the wan application delivery market continues to develop and expand  and as consolidation occurs 

table of contents the primary factors considered by our customers in selecting an appropriate solution include product characteristics such as reliability  feature sets  scalability and ease of use  as well as factors such as price and the availability and quality of customer support 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights our success is heavily dependent on our ability to create proprietary technology and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in that technology  as well as our ability to defend against adverse claims of third parties with respect to our technology and intellectual property 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions and confidentiality procedures to protect trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  and patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and unauthorized third parties  including our competitors  may independently develop similar or superior technology  duplicate or reverse engineer aspects of our products  or design around our patented technology or other intellectual property 
as of april   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications provisional and non provisional  and pending foreign patent application 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that the patent examination process will not result in our narrowing the claims applied for 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect any infringement of our existing or future patents if any  or  if infringement is detected  that our patents will be enforceable or that any damages awarded to us will be sufficient to adequately compensate us 
there can be no assurance or guarantee that any products  services or technologies that we are presently developing  or will develop in the future  will result in intellectual property that is protectable under law  whether in the united states or a foreign jurisdiction  that such intellectual property will produce competitive advantage for us  or that the intellectual property of competitors will not restrict our freedom to operate or put us at a competitive disadvantage 
from time to time we may and do receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights or offering licenses under such intellectual property rights 
while it is our policy to respect the legitimate intellectual property rights of others  we may defend against such claims or seek to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise settle such claims  where appropriate 
nevertheless  there has been a substantial amount of litigation over intellectual property rights in our industry and we expect this to continue 
hence  third parties may claim that we  or our current or potential future products  infringe their intellectual property rights  and any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  result in the assessment of damages  result in management distraction  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
employees as of april   we had a total of  employees  comprised of in sales  in research and development  in customer support  in general and administrative  in manufacturing and in marketing 
of these employees  were located in north america and were located in various other international locations 
none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements  nor have we experienced any work stoppages 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors factors affecting future operating results in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered by investors before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed as a consequence of any of the following risks and uncertainties 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impair our business  financial condition and results of operations  or result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and our ability to forecast our quarterly operating results is limited  so our operating results may not meet our guidance or third party expectations 
our net revenue and operating results have in the past  and may in the future  vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors limit our ability to accurately predict our operating results on a quarterly basis  and include factors discussed elsewhere in this risk factors section together with the following the timing  size and mix of orders from customers  fluctuations in demand for our products and services  certain markets in which we compete are relatively new and are evolving  variability and unpredictability in the rate of growth in the markets in which we compete  our ability to continue to increase our respective market shares consistent with past rates of increase  our variable sales cycles  which may lengthen as the complexity of products and competition in our markets increases  the level of competition in our target product markets  including new entrants or substantial discounting  market acceptance of our new products and product enhancements  announcements  introductions and transitions of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  and deferrals of customer orders which may result from such announcements  introductions and transitions  technological changes in our product target markets  future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies  our recognition of revenue in accordance with statement of position sop requires that some product revenue be recognized ratably over a defined period or deferred to a future period if we are unable to establish fair value for the undelivered element  such as support  and 
table of contents future macroeconomic conditions in our domestic and international markets  as well as the level of discretionary it spending generally 
a high percentage of our expenses  including those related to manufacturing overhead  technical support  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions  are essentially fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our net revenue is less than forecast  such expenses cannot effectively be reduced and our quarterly operating results will be adversely affected 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results should not necessarily be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in the past our quarterly results have on occasion failed to meet our quarterly guidance and the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and it is likely that this will occur in the future 
if this occurs our stock price likely will decline  and may decline significantly 
such a decline may also occur even when we meet our guidance but our results or future guidance fail to meet third party expectations 
we must anticipate market needs  and develop and introduce new products and enhance existing products to rapidly meet those needs  or we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected 
to maintain our competitive position in a market characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement  we must correctly anticipate market requirements and invest our research and development resources to meet those requirements 
the introduction of new products by others  market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies  or the emergence of new industry standards  could render our existing products obsolete or make it easier for other products to compete with our products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  identify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
there is no guarantee that we will accurately predict the direction in which the secure web gateway and wan application delivery markets will evolve 
failure on our part to anticipate the direction of our markets and to develop products and enhancements that meet the needs of those markets will significantly impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the wan applications delivery market is intensely competitive and certain of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  and may take actions that could weaken our competitive position or reduce our net revenue 
we have increasingly invested in and focused on the wan application delivery market 
this market is intensely competitive  and the intensity of this competition is expected to increase in the future 
such increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and we cannot be certain that competitive pressures we face will not seriously harm our business 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
in addition  we expect that there will be competition from other established and emerging companies as the market for wan application delivery products continues to develop and expand 

table of contents many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  significantly greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
such competitors also may have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  those competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  marketing  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
they also may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other providers  thereby increasing their ability to provide a broader suite of products  and potentially causing customers to defer purchasing decisions 
also  larger competitors may be able to integrate some of the functionality of our products into existing infrastructure products or to bundle wan application delivery products with other product offerings 
finally  they may engage in aggressive pricing strategies or discounting 
any of the foregoing may limit our ability to compete effectively in the market and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our acquisitions may not provide the anticipated benefits and may disrupt our existing business 
in june of  we completed our acquisition of packeteer  inc packeteer 
we have also acquired other businesses in the past  including our acquisition of permeo technologies  inc permeo and our acquisition of certain assets of the netcache business from network appliance 
it is likely we will acquire additional businesses or assets in the future 
there is no guaranty that such acquisitions will yield the benefits we anticipate 
the success of any acquisition is impacted by a number of factors  and may be subject to the following risks inability to successfully integrate the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  loss of key employees  and substantial transaction costs 
acquisitions may also result in risks to our existing business  including dilution of our current stockholders percentage ownership to the extent we issue new equity  assumption of additional liabilities  incurrence of additional debt or a decline in available cash  adverse effects to our financial statements  such as the need to make large and immediate write offs or the incurrence of restructuring and other related expenses  liability for intellectual property infringement and other litigation claims  which we may or may not be aware of at the time of acquisition  and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense or impairment charges 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could seriously harm our business 
economic uncertainty and adverse macroeconomic conditions may harm our business 
our revenues and margins are dependent on various economic factors  including rates of inflation  currency fluctuations  energy costs  levels of consumer sentiment  and other macroeconomic factors which may impact levels of business spending 
these conditions may affect corporate spending for it products and services in specific geographies or more broadly 
a decrease in corporate spending or demand for our products and services could result in a reduction in our net revenue  gross margin and operating margin  
table of contents increased price competition for our products and services  risk of excess and obsolete inventory  higher overhead costs as a percentage of net revenue  and a reduced ability to collect customer receivables 
in addition  a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends  which could limit our ability to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 
recent adverse economic and market conditions in the united states have resulted in delays in closing customer orders in that region  and further uncertainty or deterioration in these conditions could materially impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our internal investments in research and development may not yield the anticipated benefits 
the success of our business is predicated on our ability to create new products and technologies and to anticipate future market requirements and applicable industry standards 
the process of developing new technologies is time consuming  complex and uncertain  and requires commitment of significant resources well in advance of being able to fully determine market requirements and industry standards 
furthermore  we may not be able to timely execute new product or technical initiatives because of errors in product planning or timing  technical difficulties that we cannot timely resolve  or a lack of appropriate resources 
this could result in competitors bringing products to market before we do and a consequent decrease in our market share and net revenue 
our inability to timely and cost effectively introduce new products and product enhancements  or the failure of these new products or enhancements to achieve market acceptance and comply with industry standards  could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additionally  our introduction of new products and product enhancements could result in the obsolescence of previously purchased or committed inventory  potentially requiring the recording of material charges  which would reduce our net income 
unless we develop better market awareness of our company and our products  our net revenue may not grow as anticipated 
we are a relatively new entrant in the wan application delivery market and  in our opinion  have not yet established sufficient market awareness of our participation in that market 
market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets  particularly in the wan application delivery market 
if our advertising and marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected  and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 
if the market for wan application delivery products does not develop as we anticipate  we may not be able to achieve an acceptable increase of our net revenue  and the price of our stock may decline 
we have increasingly invested in and focused on the wan application delivery market 
however  that is a new and rapidly evolving market 
if this market fails to grow as we anticipate  or grows more slowly than we anticipate  we may not be able to sell as many of our wan application delivery products as we currently project  which would result in a decline in our anticipated net revenue and could result in a decline in our stock price 
third party product developments may impact the value of our products to users 
our wan application delivery appliances are purchased to secure  accelerate and control the delivery of third party software applications and content 
it is possible that the providers of software applications and operating systems which operate with the software applications and content accelerated by our appliances may 
table of contents enhance the performance of their software  such that further acceleration of affected applications and content is not necessary 
this would make our products less valuable to users of that software 
in addition  manufacturers of hardware or software may incorporate functionality similar to that offered by our wan application delivery or secure web gateway products directly into their products  which would make our products less valuable to users of those products 
any of the foregoing may limit our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty  and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 
forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules  the results of examinations by various tax authorities  and the impact of any acquisition  business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction 
to forecast our global tax rate  we estimate our pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction and calculate our tax expense by jurisdiction 
if the mix of profits and losses  our ability to use tax credits  or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated  our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we issued convertible notes and warrants to fund our acquisition of packeteer which could impact our liquidity 
we issued warrants and zero coupon senior convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of million that mature in  in order to acquire packeteer 
if these notes are not converted prior to maturity we will be required to repay the principal amount  and may not have funds available to do so 
as well  the notes contain certain conditions of default and  should a default occur  the holders of the notes may be able to require early payment of the notes 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  our business could be harmed 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will enable us to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash is required for unanticipated needs  we may need additional capital during that period 
the development and marketing of new products  the investment in our sales and marketing efforts  and the integration of the packeteer business will require a significant commitment of resources 
if the market for our products develops at a slower pace than anticipated  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if we were unable to raise additional capital when required  our business could be seriously harmed 
we have a history of losses and profitability could be difficult to sustain 
while we have been profitable in certain quarters  we have not been able to maintain consistent profitability on a quarterly basis 
although we were profitable in all four quarters of fiscal  we were not profitable in three of the four fiscal quarters in fiscal  and may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our ability to achieve  sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis will be affected by changes in our business and the demand for our products and services 
we expect our operating expenses to 
table of contents increase as we endeavor to grow revenue  and we anticipate that we will make investments in our business 
our results of operations will be harmed if our revenue does not increase at a rate commensurate with the rate of increase in our expenses 
if our revenue is less than anticipated or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted quickly and efficiently  we may continue to experience losses on a quarterly and annual basis 
we must attract  assimilate and retain key personnel on a cost effective basis  or our ability to execute our business strategy and generate sales could be harmed 
we depend on key management  research and development  and sales personnel  and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel on an ongoing basis 
our success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain key personnel 
we have seen an increase in competition with respect to cash and equity compensation offered by employers in the silicon valley  and in other areas where we have operations  that may make it more difficult to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
the majority of our employees  including our senior management personnel  are employed on an at will basis  which may make it easier for key employees to leave us and move to new employment 
our inability to timely hire replacement or additional employees may impact our operations  since new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity 
this may affect our ability to grow our net revenue 
in particular  new sales personnel typically take a number of months to achieve acceptable productivity and generate the expected level of sales 
we rely significantly on third party sales channel partners to sell our products 
a significant amount of our revenue is generated through sales by our sales channel partners  which include distributors and resellers 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated through our indirect sales channels 
we depend upon these partners to generate sales opportunities and to independently manage the sales process for opportunities with which they are involved 
in order to increase our net revenue  we will need to maintain our existing sales channel partners and add new sales channel partners and effectively train and integrate them with our sales process 
if we are unsuccessful in those efforts  our business will not grow and our operating results will be adversely affected 
our products are complex  and there can be no assurance that the sales training programs that are offered to our sales channel partners will be effective 
in addition  our sales channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing  selling and supporting our products and services for reasons unrelated to training 
most of our sales channel partners do not have minimum purchase or resale requirements  and may cease selling our products at any time 
they may also market  sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours  and may devote more resources to the marketing  sales and support of products competitive to ours 
there is no assurance that we will retain these sales channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement sales channel partners in the future 
the loss of one or more of our key sales channel partners in a given geographic area could harm our operating results within that area  as new sales channel partners typically require extensive training and take several months to achieve acceptable productivity 
we also depend on many of our sales channel partners to deliver first line service and support for our products 
any significant failure on their part to provide such service and support could impact customer satisfaction and future sales of our products 
in addition  we recognize a portion of our revenue based on a sell through model using information provided by our sales channel partners 
if we are provided with inaccurate or untimely information  the amount  timing or accuracy of our reported net revenue could be affected 

table of contents if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a customer order  revenue relating to the entire order may be deferred until the revenue recognition criteria for all elements of the customer order are met 
this could lower our net revenue in one period and increase it in future periods  resulting in greater variability in net revenue and income period to period 
in the course of our sales efforts  we often enter into arrangements with our customers that require us to deliver a combination of different appliances  software products or services 
we refer to each individual appliance  software product or service as an element of the overall arrangement with our customer 
in some cases  these arrangements may require us to deliver particular elements in a future period 
we do not recognize revenue on any element until it has been delivered 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue on any delivered element until we can determine the fair value of all undelivered elements in the arrangement 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized at the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be determined 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have a fair value is maintenance  revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
as a result  a portion of the revenue we recognize in each quarter could relate to previously delivered products 
consequently  an increase in the number of multiple element arrangements with undelivered elements for which we cannot determine the fair value would negatively impact our net revenue in the current period  while increasing net revenue in future periods 
in addition  we may not adjust our cost structure commensurately with the reduction in net revenue recognized in the current period  which would reduce our income for the current period 
if there is a significant increase in sales related to multiple element arrangements with undelivered elements for which we cannot determine the fair value  we may not meet current revenue expectations since revenue associated with such arrangements will be recognized in future periods 
we are dependent on original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture our products  and changes to those relationships  expected or unexpected  may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we depend primarily on original design manufacturers each of whom is a third party original design manufacturer for numerous companies to co design and co develop the hardware platform for our products 
we also depend on independent contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products and the assemblies and components contained in our products 
these manufacturers are not committed to design or manufacture our products on a long term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price 
also  from time to time  we may be required to add new manufacturers or manufacturing sites to accommodate growth in orders or the addition of new products 
it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement new original design manufacturer and contract manufacturer relationships and sites  and such additions increase the complexity of our supply chain management 
our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed if we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships  if one or more of our design manufacturers does not meet our development schedules  if one or more of our contract manufacturers experiences delays  disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing our products  or if we are required to add or replace design manufacturers or contract manufacturers or sites 
in addition  these manufacturers have access to certain of our critical intellectual property and could wrongly disclose or misappropriate such property 
moreover  an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed in china and taiwan and other countries and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with doing business in those countries 
each of these factors could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements and manage our supply chain we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could harm our business 
we provide forecasts of our requirements to our contract manufacturers on a rolling month basis 
if our forecast exceeds our actual requirements  the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liability for excess inventory  each of which could negatively affect our gross margin 
if our forecast is less than our 
table of contents actual requirements  the contract manufacturers may have insufficient time and components to produce our product requirements  which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments  customer dissatisfaction  and deferral or loss of revenue 
as well  we may be required to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy our future needs in situations where a component is being discontinued 
if we fail to accurately predict our requirements  we may become liable for excess inventory that we and our contract manufacturers cannot use or we may be unable to fulfill customer orders 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on single and  in some cases  sole and limited source suppliers for several key components  so our business is susceptible to shortages  unavailability  or price fluctuations 
we have limited sources of supply for certain key components of our products  which exposes us to the risk of component shortages or unavailability 
in addition  we are unable to rapidly change quantities and delivery schedules because the procurement of certain components is subject to lengthy lead times and the qualification of additional or alternate sources is time consuming  costly and difficult 
in the event our business growth exceeds our projections  or required components are otherwise in scarce supply  we may be subject to shortages  delays or unavailability of such components  or potential price increases  which may be substantial 
if we are unable to secure sufficient components at reasonable prices in order to timely build our products  customer shipments may be delayed 
this would adversely affect both our relationships with those customers and our net revenue 
alternatively  we may pay increased prices  which would impact our gross margin 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors  and may be below our expectations or the expectations of investors and analysts  which could cause a decline in our stock price 
our gross margin percentage has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including market acceptance of our products and fluctuations in demand  the timing and size of customer orders and product implementations  increased price competition and changes in product pricing  actions taken by our competitors  new product introductions and enhancements  manufacturing and component costs  availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand  purchase of inventory in excess of demand  our execution of our strategy and operating plans  changes in our sales model  geographies in which sales are made  and revenue recognition rules 
for example  we have in the past entered into large revenue transactions with certain customers that  because of the product mix and volume discount  have decreased our gross margin percentage 
we may  in the future  enter into similar transactions 
as well  our lower end appliances have lower margins than our higher end appliances  and if our customers submit a large order or orders for our lower end appliances  the combination of lower margins and the volume discount provided to those customers would negatively impact our gross margin percentage 

table of contents even if we achieve our net revenue and operating expense objectives  our net income and operating results may be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and analysts if our gross margins are below expectations 
this could cause our stock price to decline 
our international operations expose us to risks 
we currently have operations in a number of foreign countries 
in fiscal  of our total net revenue was derived from customers outside of north america  thus  our business is substantially dependent on economic conditions and it spending in markets outside north america 
the expansion of our international operations and entry into additional international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources  and subjects us to certain inherent risks including technical difficulties and costs associated with product localization  challenges associated with coordinating product development efforts among geographically dispersed areas  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation  or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights  our limited experience in establishing a sales and marketing presence  together with the appropriate internal systems  processes and controls  in certain geographic markets  longer payment cycles for sales in certain foreign countries  seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and at other times in various countries  the significant presence of some of our competitors in some international markets  potentially adverse tax consequences  import and export restrictions and tariffs and other trade protection initiatives  potential failures of our foreign employees to comply with both us and foreign laws  including antitrust laws  trade regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act  compliance with foreign laws and other government controls  such as those affecting trade  privacy  the environment and employment  management  staffing  legal and other costs of operating an enterprise spread over various countries  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  political or economic instability  war or terrorism in the countries where we are doing business  and fears concerning travel or health risks that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services in any country in which the business sales culture encourages face to face interactions 
to the extent we are unable to effectively manage our international operations and these risks  our international sales may be adversely affected  we may incur additional and unanticipated costs  and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory action 
as a consequence  our business  financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 
the matters relating to our historical stock granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements in march have required us to incur substantial expenses  have resulted in litigation and regulatory inquiries  and may result in additional litigation  regulatory proceedings and governmental enforcement actions 
our historical stock granting practices and the consequent restatement of our financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory and government enforcement actions 
on 
table of contents march   in our form k for the year ended april   we restated our consolidated financial statements as of april   and for the years ended april  and  to correctly account for stock option grants for which we had determined that the measurement date for accounting purposes was different from the stated grant date the march restatement 
in addition  we also restated our selected consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended april    and  and the unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the years ended april  and  with the exception of the fourth quarter of fiscal which had not then been filed 
for more information on these matters  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background of the stock option investigation  findings  restatement of consolidated financial statements  remedial measures and related proceedings  and item a  controls and procedures in our annual report on form k for the year ended april   and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background of the stock option investigation  findings  restatement of consolidated financial statements  remedial measures and related proceedings  and item  controls and procedures  on form q for the quarter ended january   each of which was filed with the sec on march  the matters addressed in the march restatement have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  multiple derivative complaints have been filed in state and federal courts against our directors and certain of our executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants  and certain proceedings with respect to such matters are ongoing at the sec and the us attorney s office for the northern district of california 
we also may become the subject of  or otherwise be required to incur legal fees and costs in connection with  additional private litigation  regulatory proceedings  or government enforcement actions in connection with the march restatement 
no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes of such activities or that such outcomes will be consistent with the findings of our special committee reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended april  the resolution of these matters has been  and will continue to be  time consuming and expensive  and will distract management from the conduct of our business 
our available directors and officers liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover our legal expenses or those of persons we are obligated to indemnify  and may not cover all items for which we must procure representation or for which we are obligated to provide indemnification 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the march restatement and the related litigation and regulatory proceedings  and any negative outcome that may occur from them  could impact our relationships with customers and our ability to generate future net revenue 
in fiscal  we continued to incur substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services related to the matters addressed above 
in addition  we incurred expenses in connection with our resolution of issues related to the march restatement that affected our international and domestic employees  including payment of taxes due under internal revenue code section a 
we may not be able to successfully manage the growth of our business if we are unable to improve our internal systems  processes and controls 
our growth  as well as recent regulatory requirements and changes in financial standards  has placed increased demands on our management and our infrastructure 
the acquisition of packeteer  or any other acquisitions we may make  also will place increased demands on us 
we need to continue to improve our internal systems  processes and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth  including our international growth into new geographies 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems  processes and controls in a timely or efficient manner  and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems  processes and controls 
our failure to improve our systems  processes and controls may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue  expenses and earnings  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 

table of contents we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used with our products 
we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including third party software and open source software that is used with certain of our products 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this software on commercially reasonable terms  we will face delays in releases of our software or we will be required to delete this functionality from our software until equivalent technology can be licensed or developed and integrated into our current product 
in addition  the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights might require us to engage in litigation regarding these matters  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
any of these developments could seriously harm our business 
undetected product errors  or failures found in new products may result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could cause us to incur significant costs  reduce our sales or result in litigation 
our products are highly complex and may contain undetected operating errors when first introduced or as new versions or enhancements are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products or new versions until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales opportunities 
this could materially adversely affect our operating results 
these errors could also cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
in addition  all of our products operate on our internally developed operating system 
as a result  any error in the operating system will affect all of our products 
we have experienced minor errors in the past in connection with new products and enhancements to existing products 
we expect that errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments  which could seriously harm our business 
since our end user customers install our appliances directly into their network infrastructures  any errors  defects or other performance problems with our products could negatively impact their networks or other internet users  resulting in financial or other losses 
while we typically seek by contract to limit our exposure to damages  it is possible that such limitations might not exist or might not be enforced in the event of a product liability claim 
moreover  a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly and could seriously harm our business reputation 
we are the target of various litigation and regulatory proceedings  which could result in substantial costs  divert management attention and resources  and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various litigation  including class action litigation arising out of our initial public offering in and stockholder derivative actions arising out of allegedly misleading statements about our prospects made between february  and may   which actions were subsequently amended to seek relief on our behalf from certain defendants with respect to our historical stock option practices 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are the subject of inquiries and investigations conducted by the sec and the us attorney s office for the northern district of california 
any material litigation and regulatory proceeding inevitably results in the diversion of our management s attention and expenditure of our resources 
as well  any negative result or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if the protection of our proprietary technology is inadequate  our competitors may gain access to our technology  and our market share could decline 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to create proprietary technology and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in that technology  as well as our ability to defend against adverse claims of third parties with respect to our technology and intellectual property 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  and patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and unauthorized third parties  including our competitors  may independently develop similar or superior technology  duplicate or reverse engineer aspects of our products  or design around our patented technology or other intellectual property 
as of april   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications provisional and non provisional  and pending foreign patent application 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that the patent examination process will not result in our narrowing the claims applied for 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect any infringement of our existing or future patents if any or  if infringement is detected  that our patents will be enforceable or that any damages awarded to us will be sufficient to adequately compensate us 
there can be no assurance or guarantee that any products  services or technologies that we are presently developing  or will develop in the future  will result in intellectual property that is subject to legal protection under the laws of the united states or a foreign jurisdiction and that produces a competitive advantage for us 
third parties could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
third parties have in the past and may in the future claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights  and these claims  even if without merit  could harm our business by increasing our costs  reducing our net revenue or by creating customer concerns that result in reduced sales 
this is particularly true in the patent area  as an increasing number of us patents covering computer networking and internet technology have been issued in recent years 
patent owners  including those that do not commercially manufacture or sell products  may claim that one or more of our products infringes a patent they own 
for example  on or about april   realtime data  llc d b a ixo filed a patent infringement lawsuit against packeteer  inc  a company we acquired on june   and subsequently amended the complaint and named us as a defendant on june   see note in the consolidated financial statements 
we expect that companies in the internet and networking industries will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
the market price of our stock is volatile  and is likely to be volatile in the future 
since our initial public offering  the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly 
such volatility in the trading price of our stock can occur in response to general market conditions  changes in the it or technology market generally or changes in the specific markets in which we operate  and cause an increase or decline in our stock price without regard to our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock could decline quickly and significantly if we 
table of contents fail to achieve our guidance or if our performance fails to meet the expectation of public market analysts or investors 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  among others variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts  changes in macroeconomic conditions  the introduction of new products by our competitors  our ability to keep pace with changing technological requirements  changes in market valuations of internet related and networking companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss of a major customer  additions or departures of key personnel  fluctuations in stock market volumes  investor confidence in our stock  technology stocks and the stock market in general  speculation in the press or investment communication about our strategic position  financial condition  results of operations  or business  significant transactions  and regulatory or litigation matters 
it is not uncommon for securities class actions or other litigation to be brought against a company after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  and we have been subject to such litigation in the past 
such actions could result in management distraction and expense and  further  result in a decline in our stock price 
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required level of export license or under an export license exception  because we incorporate encryption technology into our products 
in addition  various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries 
changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets  prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or  in some cases  prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether 
any change in export or import regulations or related legislation  shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations  or change in the countries  persons or technologies targeted by such regulations  could result in decreased use of our products by  or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to  existing or potential customers with international operations 
any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event 
our business operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control 
in addition  a substantial portion of our facilities  including our headquarters  are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
we do not carry earthquake insurance for earthquake related losses 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
to the extent that such events disrupt our business or adversely impact our reputation  such events could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the legal environment in which we operate is uncertain and claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
our products operate in part by storing material available on the internet and making this material available to end users from our appliance 
as well  our appliance may be used to block content from being accessed 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with our customers  for defamation  negligence  intellectual property infringement  personal injury  censorship  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content  copying or modification of this content 
as of april   we have not accrued any liabilities relating to indemnification provisions with our customers 
it is also possible that if any information provided through any of our products contains errors  third parties could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on this information 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed

overview we sell a family of proxy appliances and related software and services 
proxy appliances are computer hardware devices that  together with internal software  secure  accelerate and control the delivery of business applications and other information over a wan or across an enterprise s internet gateway  where its local computer network links to the public internet 
our goal is to provide intelligent application delivery solutions to optimize the flow of information throughout an enterprise  without compromising the integrity of that information 
when we first introduced our proxy appliances with wan acceleration capability in fiscal  we anticipated that the market for web security and wan acceleration products  each of which was then viewed as a separate market  would converge in the future 
we believed that it departments would be required to manage both functions and would select a single solution  where it met appropriate criteria 
idc  a leading information and technology research and advisory firm  defines that converged web security market and wan acceleration market as the wan application delivery market 
we have increasingly seen the anticipated convergence of web security and wan acceleration and optimization  such that now many of our customers that purchase our products for their wan acceleration and optimization capability are also implementing our web security functionality 
similarly  our web security customers are also implementing our wan acceleration and optimization capabilities 
we believe that enterprises are being driven by the need to centralize their it operations  while simultaneously managing mobile employees and remote locations and dealing with global business needs and requirements 
these trends  together with new types of applications such as remotely hosted software as a service and web applications  should create demand for the application delivery network that we envision and upon which we are focusing 
table of contents development of our products 
this network layer would monitor and control all information flowing between the communications network and the application servers and end users that it serves 
we continue to monitor domestic and global macroeconomic conditions  and their actual and anticipated impact on it spending  including on spending for proxy appliances 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had certain large sales transactions that failed to close  particularly in the us we believe that these largely were delays  resulting from increased scrutiny of spending decisions  and that these sales opportunities will continue to be available to us 
we have observed a lengthening of our average sales cycle  which means that sales take longer to close 
in light of the difficult us market and economic environment  we recently have been focusing more of our sales and marketing efforts on international transactions  and anticipate that a greater proportion of our revenue will be derived from such transactions in the near term  provided such markets do not suffer a material decline in it spending 
we track financial metrics  including net revenue  operating margin  deferred revenue  cash flow from operations  and cash position  as key measures of our business performance 
net revenue net revenue  which includes both product revenue and service revenue  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
our product revenue  consisting of sales of our proxy appliances and perpetual licenses to our blue coat webfilter product  was million in fiscal this was an increase of compared with product revenue in fiscal we recognized million in service revenue in fiscal  a increase compared with service revenue recognized in fiscal operating margin in fiscal  our operating income increased to million from an operating loss of million in fiscal our operating results during the year benefited from a decrease in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue when compared with the prior year 
total operating expenses increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  which was largely attributable to our continued investment in headcount to expand our sales force and marketing functions 
total operating expenses declined to of net revenue in fiscal compared with of net revenue in fiscal deferred revenue net deferred revenue was million at april  compared with million at april  the increase was attributable to both an increase in the sales of new maintenance and renewal contracts to our customers and an increased level of inventory held by our stocking distributors 
this increase was partially offset by the continued amortization of subscription based revenue associated with our blue coat web filter product  which was sold on a subscription basis until november cash flow from operations and cash position during fiscal  we generated cash flow from operations of million  compared with million generated during fiscal our cash  restricted cash and short term investments were million at the end of fiscal  compared with million at the previous fiscal year end of april  on august   our board of directors approved a two for one forward stock split of our common stock 
the stock split was effected by the issuance of a stock dividend of one share of our common stock for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date of september  the split adjusted stock began trading on the nasdaq global market on october  our stock currently trades on the nasdaq global select market 
all share numbers in this document reflect our capital structure as of the end of the fiscal year and are therefore on a post split basis 
shares authorized and par value were not adjusted as they were not affected by the stock split 

table of contents packeteer acquisition on june   after the close of fiscal  we acquired packeteer  inc packeteer  a pioneer in delivering sophisticated wan traffic prioritization through the development and sale of application classification and performance management technologies and products 
we believe that acquiring packeteer will accelerate our ability to offer a comprehensive platform to address the application delivery and security challenges confronting today s distributed enterprise 
we intend to continue to sell the packetshaper  intelligence center and policy center products formerly offered by packeteer and to rebrand them as blue coat products 
we also intend to enhance the technologies developed and owned by packeteer and to integrate them into our current and future products 
the acquisition of packeteer should provide us with increased sales resources  through the addition of packeteer sales teams and channels  additional revenue  through sales of the additional products  and added cost efficiencies that result from scaling our business 
our acquisition of packeteer was effected through a tender offer  followed by a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary into packeteer 
as a result of the transaction  packeteer became our wholly owned subsidiary and each outstanding share of packeteer that was not tendered in the tender offer other than restricted shares  shares already held by us  packeteer or our respective wholly owned subsidiaries  or shares held by stockholders who properly perfect appraisal rights under delaware law was converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
the aggregate purchase price  which has not yet been determined  will consist of million in cash paid for packeteer s common stock  plus the value of assumed stock options and direct transaction costs 
to date  the acquisition has been funded by approximately million in cash from internal sources and million in cash from the issuance of convertible notes 
on april   we entered into a note purchase agreement  pursuant to which we agreed to sell million of zero coupon convertible senior notes due and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to manchester securities corp 
manchester and  francisco partners ii  lp fp in a private placement 
the notes and the warrants were issued to manchester  fp and an affiliate of fp the purchasers on june   following the expiration of the initial offering period of our tender offer 
the notes do not bear interest  and are convertible into shares of our common stock at the initial conversion price of  which represents a conversion premium based on the closing price of our common stock on april  the warrants permit the purchasers to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
the warrants expire in june we used the proceeds from the private placement to partially fund the acquisition of packeteer 
the operations of packeteer and blue coat will be reported on a combined basis commencing with our financial statements for the quarter ending july  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and related allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  valuation of inventories  valuation of goodwill  valuation of long lived and identifiable intangible assets and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 

table of contents we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments that materially affect our financial statements  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts stock based compensation valuation of inventories valuation of goodwill valuation of long lived and identifiable intangible assets income taxes revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts our products include software that is essential to the functionality of the appliances 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to the appliances through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with sop no 
 and all related interpretations 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we recognize 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and  in certain instances  sales contracts or agreements 
delivery or performance has occurred 
shipping terms and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or performance 
most of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for certain stock rotation rights 
net revenue and the related cost of net revenue resulting from shipments to distributors are deferred until the distributors report that our products have been sold to a customer 
product revenue in china is deferred until the customer registers the proxy appliance 
for sales made direct to end users and value added resellers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which generally is upon shipment 
we do not accept orders from these value added resellers when we are aware that the value added reseller does not have an order from an end user customer 
we do not have significant obligations for future performance  such as rights of return or pricing credits  associated with sales to end users and value added resellers 
the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
our customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial condition and ability to pay for our products and services 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon the review process  revenue is not recognized until cash receipt 
for products in an arrangement that includes multiple elements  such as appliances  maintenance  content filtering software or anti virus software  we use the residual method to recognize revenue for the delivered 
table of contents elements 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements  provided that vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we analyze our stand alone maintenance renewals by sales channel and geography strata 
we determine the vsoe of fair value for maintenance by analyzing our stand alone maintenance renewals noting that a substantial majority of transactions fall within a narrow range for each stratum 
in limited cases  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on management determined prices 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized at the earlier of when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established for the remaining undelivered elements 
when vsoe of fair value cannot be determined for an undelivered element  revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance or subscription period 
maintenance and subscription revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract  with the related expenses recognized as incurred 
maintenance and subscription contracts usually have a term of one to three years 
unearned maintenance and subscription revenue is included in deferred revenue 
all shipping costs are charged to cost of net revenue 
when we bill customers for shipping  we record the invoice amount for shipping costs in net revenue 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends  and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of such allowance  and any required changes in the allowance are recorded to general and administrative expense 
we write off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible 
stock based compensation effective may   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expenses recognized beginning on that date include a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on our historical experience of grants  exercises and post vesting cancellations 
we estimate the volatility of our stock options at the date of grant using a combination of historical and implied volatilities  consistent with sfas no 
r and sab no 
we base the risk free rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term of our option grants 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  which requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated our forfeiture rate at based on an analysis of historical pre vesting forfeitures  and have reduced stock based compensation expense accordingly 
for options granted before may   we amortize the fair value on a graded basis 
for options granted on or after may   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
the fair value of all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 

table of contents valuation of inventories inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market after appropriate consideration has been given to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand and market conditions 
valuation of goodwill we perform annual goodwill impairment tests in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  during our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
for purposes of the annual impairment test  we consider our market capitalization on the date of the impairment test since we have only one reporting unit 
we performed our recurring annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that no impairment existed at the end of our fiscal year valuation of long lived and identifiable intangible assets we periodically evaluate potential impairments of our long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment 
variances in our assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusions as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value as calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our income tax expense together with calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary difference resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
on may   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  issued in june fin prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition issues 
see note income taxes for additional information 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of our tax attributes will be realizable by either refundable income taxes or future taxable income  the 
table of contents valuation allowance will be reduced and the related tax impact will be recorded to the provision in that quarter 
likewise  should we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be recorded to the provision in the period such determination was made

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including operating results  our history of losses and forecasts of future taxable income 
at april   our projections of future taxable income enabled us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  million million of federal and million of state of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was reversed as a credit to the provision for income taxes 
our conclusion that a portion of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized is strongly influenced by our projections of future taxable income 
our estimate of future taxable income considers all available positive and negative evidence regarding our current and future operations  including projections of income in various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we believe our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable  however  it is inherently uncertain  
table of contents and if our future operations generate taxable income greater than projected  further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible 
conversely  if we realize unforeseen material losses in the future  or our ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced  additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded 
at april   the balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance was approximately million 
as of april   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal years ending in through if not utilized 
we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal through if not utilized 
we also had federal and california research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
the federal credit will expire in fiscal and if not utilized 
the california credit is not subject to expiration 
utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
annual limitations have resulted in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization of approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively  as well as 
million and million of federal and state credits  respectively  are subject to annual limitations ranging from approximately million to million 
see note income taxes for additional information 
on may   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  issued in june fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 
under fin we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not recognize a cumulative adjustment to the may  balance of retained earnings as the amount was deemed immaterial 
the cumulative effect of adoption of fin did not result in a material adjustment to our tax liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes 
accrued interest relating to the income tax on the unrecognized tax benefits as of may  and april   was approximately  and  respectively  with approximately  being included as a component of provision for income taxes in the year ended april  see note income taxes for additional information

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash provided by operating activities  private sales of preferred and common stock and convertible debt  bank loans  equipment leases  and an initial public offering of our common stock 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial condition  facilitate expansion  pursue strategic acquisitions or investments  or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
april  dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments restricted cash and cash equivalents percentage of total assets year ended april  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal  compared with million for fiscal this increase was largely attributable to the growth in net income for the fiscal year 
working capital sources of cash in fiscal included increases in deferred revenue of million  accounts payable of million  accrued payroll and related benefits of million and other accrued liabilities of million 
deferred revenue increased primarily as a result of an increase in new service contracts sold with our appliances as well as the renewal of service contracts from our expanding installed base  both of which are recognized ratably over the service period 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased during fiscal due to an increase in operating expenses 
accrued payroll and related benefits increased primarily due to increased headcount and a higher commission accrual 
working capital uses of cash during fiscal included an increase in our accounts receivable balance of million 
this increase was largely due to higher net revenues in fiscal and an increase in our days sales outstanding dso 
our dso increased from days at april  to days at april   which was largely attributable to a greater concentration of revenues recognized in the last month of the quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal also contributing to working capital uses of cash was an increase in net deferred tax assets of million as a result of the partial release in our valuation allowance 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million used in investing activities for fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal included million for the purchase of investment securities  million for the purchase of packeteer common stock  and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
this was offset by the sale of investment securities of million 
the increased use of cash for property and equipment  as compared to the prior year  was primarily related to purchases of computer equipment  software  furniture and leasehold improvements associated with the growth in our business 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal included million for the purchase of investment securities  million in cash consideration and direct costs related to the acquisition of certain assets of the netcache business  and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
in the future  we expect that any cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing securities 
through the date of this report  the acquisition of packeteer has been funded by approximately million in cash from internal sources and million in cash from the issuance of convertible notes 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and a tax benefit related to stock based compensation of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily related to the net proceeds received from our sale of series a preferred stock of million 
on june   we issued million in zero coupon convertible senior notes the notes as well as warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of in a private placement 
the notes are convertible into  shares of our common stock at the holders option at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of 
the notes do not bear interest 
we used the million proceeds from the private placement to partially fund the acquisition of packeteer  inc the notes mature in june of unless converted into common stock or accelerated as a result of our default under the notes prior to such date 
our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
as of april   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash totaled million 

table of contents contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations as of april  in thousands year ended april  thereafter total future minimum lease payments purchase and other commitments total we lease certain equipment and office facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal year the facility leases generally require us to pay operating costs  including property taxes  insurance and maintenance  and contain scheduled rent increases and certain other rent escalation clauses 
rent expense is recognized in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases after consideration of rent holidays and improvement allowances  if applicable  with any assets purchased using a lessee improvement allowance capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the lease term 
in september  we commenced a five year operating lease of a building that serves as our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
as part of this agreement  we are required to maintain a million irrevocable standby letter of credit with a major financial institution as a form of security 
the letter of credit is secured by deposits and provides for automatic annual extensions  without amendment  through the end of the lease term in august the amount of the letter of credit did not change during fiscal the deposits securing the letter of credit are classified as long term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of april  and  respectively 
we amended this lease subsequent to the end of fiscal  as described in note  subsequent events unaudited 
in addition  we have firm purchase and other commitments with various suppliers and contract manufacturers to purchase component inventory  manufacturing material and equipment 
these agreements are enforceable and legally binding against us in the short term and a majority of the amounts under these arrangements are due within one year 
our minimum obligation at april  under these arrangements was million 
after the close of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of packeteer  and assumed responsibility for outstanding lease and purchase obligations existing at the time of the acquisition 
we have not completed our review of these agreements  and cannot reasonably estimate the future contractual obligations at this time 
on april   we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior notes due the notes in a private placement 
we also agreed to issue warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
the convertible notes and warrants were issued on june  and expire in june of the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the holders option at any time prior to maturity at the initial conversion price of  which represents a conversion premium based on the closing price of blue coat s common stock of per share on april  the notes do not bear interest 
in connection with our netcache asset acquisition in september  we entered into an escrow agreement pursuant to which we deposited in escrow million  primarily to secure certain indemnification obligations to network appliance related to this transaction until december as of april   the balance in this 
table of contents escrow account had grown to million and was classified as short term restricted cash equivalents 
as of april   the escrow agreement had expired  the amounts held in escrow were released  and the related balance was reclassified to cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet at april  at april   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
due to uncertainties with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities  nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we did not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks  and we are not a party to any interest and exchange rate risk management transactions 
we also do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of april   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  million of which is classified as restricted 
these investments are primarily held in money market funds  commercial paper and corporate securities 
we adhere to an investment policy that is intended to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates  due principally to the short term nature of the majority of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we sell our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because all of our sales are currently billed and collected in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less price competitive in foreign markets 
on the other hand  a weakening of the dollar could make our products more price competitive in foreign markets 
if the events described above were to occur  our net revenue and earnings could be materially affected  since a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings are derived from international operations 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and respectively  of our total net revenue were derived from customers outside of north america 
further  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  we do not consider the market risk associated with our international operations to be material 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes
