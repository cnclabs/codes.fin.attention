item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview our business is concentrated in areas of the soft floorcovering market where innovative styling  design  color  quality and service as well as selected distribution are welcomed and rewarded 
through our fabrica  masland residential  masland contract and dixie home brands  we have a significant presence in the high end of the soft floorcovering market 
a small portion of our manufacturing capacity is used to process plied and heat set filament yarns and provides carpet dyeing and finishing services for other carpet manufacturers 
over the last two years  tightening credit conditions  higher energy costs and other factors have considerably reduced the levels of new residential housing construction and sales of existing homes 
the housing and credit markets issues have negatively impacted the carpet industry  where sales have fallen significantly in both units and dollars over the last two years and the industry s sales volume is now running well below its high point in we have not seen signs of near term improvement in the industry s markets 
despite the market weakness  our carpet business has continued growing 
our total carpet sales grew during the two years ended december   with carpet sales up in fiscal and down in fiscal over the last five years  our carpet sales have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of  significantly faster than the industry s compounded annual rate of growth  which was duri ng this same period 
we believe our focus on high end residential and commercial markets and our dedication to the development and marketing of new and differentiated products has contributed to our growth and will allow us to continue to grow at a rate that is faster than the industry 
critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made when our financial statements are prepared 
the securities and exchange commission requires management to identify its most critical accounting policies  defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although our estimates have not differed materially from our experience  such estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title to products shipped and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions 
page accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide product warranties related to manufacturing defects and specific performance standards for our products 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of pending claims 
because our evaluations are based on historical experience and conditions at the time our financial statements are prepared  actual results could differ from the reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
this test is based on the fair value of the underlying assets and businesses to which the goodwill applies based on estimates of future cash flows  which require judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
changes in our judgments and assumptions about future economic factors could materially change our estimate of values and could materially impact the value of goodwill and our consolidated financial statements 
self insured accruals 
we estimate costs required to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory income tax rates that are expected to be applicable in future periods when temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that a change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items in the future 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
share based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments effective january  prior to january   we accounted for share based payments using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 as permitted by sfas no 
 and accordingly  did not record compensation expense for stock options since our options are issued at market value on the grant date 
we did not modify existing stock based awards prior to adoption of the new accounting standard and used the modified prospective method to account for compensation expense for share based payments for periods after the date of adoption for a all unvested stock based awards granted prior to january   based on the awards estimated grant date fair value in accordance with previous guidance  and b all stock based awards granted after december   based on the awards estimated grant date fair value in accordance with the new provisions 
all stock based awards granted prior to adoption of the new standard  and some of the awards granted after the adoption of the new standard  were not subject to a market condition 
accordingly  we used page the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of awards that are not subject to a market condition  both prior to and after adoption of the new statement 
the grant date fair value of awards that are subject to a market condition were determined using a binomial model 
because the modified prospective method was used to adopt the new standard and we used the estimated forfeiture method under sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  there was no cumulative effect on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
at december   the weighted average vesting period for unvested stock options and restricted stock awards was four and one half years 
on february  restricted stock  with a grant date fair value of approximately million was granted under our stock incentive plan 
these restricted stock awards are expected to vest over the next years to years 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles

net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million 
continued weakness in residential carpet markets had a negative impact on the sales of the industry and our business 
nevertheless  our sales continued to significantly outpace the sales of the industry  which reported that total carpet sales declined  with residential carpet sales down and commercial carpet sales improving  compared with the prior year 
our year over year carpet sales comparison reflected a decline in total carpet sales  with net sales of residential carpet down and net sales of commercial carpet growing 
in addition to difficult conditions in the industry  over of the decline in our total carpet sales was a result of lower sales of residential carpet to one large home center customer 
revenue from carpet yarn processing and carpet dyeing and finishing services decreased i n  compared with cost of sales 
the percentage point decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in  compared with was principally attributable to higher selling prices  improved product mix and operational performance 
the year over year comparison was also affected by lifo inventory liquidations that reduced cost of sales by thousand in gross profit 
despite lower net sales and higher raw material and other costs  gross profit improved million in  compared with the improved results of our modular carpet tile operation and the items described above that decreased cost of sales as a percentage of sales  more than offset the effect of lower sales volume 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million in  compared with the higher level of these expenses is principally attributable to investments in our sales and marketing infrastructure  information systems and inflationary cost increases 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses also increased due to lower net sales volume 
page other operating income 
other operating income decreased thousand in primarily due to insurance settlements and refunds in that did not repeat in which more than offset higher levels of miscellaneous income in other operating expense 
other operating expense decreased thousand in  compared with due to lower asset retirement and impairment losses and higher levels of miscellaneous expense 
defined benefit pension plan merger termination expenses 
in  million of expenses were incurred to merge our one remaining defined benefit pension plan into a multi employer plan 
these expenses principally consisted of non cash  previously unrecognized actuarial losses 
in  million of expenses were incurred to terminate our legacy defined benefit pension plan 
approximately million of these expenses related to the settlement of pension benefits for employees of our discontinued textile business segment and the remaining expenses related to the settlement of pension benefits for employees of our ongoing floorcovering business segment 
operating income 
operating income was million  or of sales in  compared with million  or of sales in interest expense 
interest expense decreased thousand in due to lower levels of debt  lower interest rates and higher levels of capitalized interest 
other income

other expense was not significant in or income tax provision 
our effective income tax rate was in  compared with in the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to reductions in our tax contingency reserve in as a result of the resolution of federal and state tax examinations and expirations of tax statutes of limitations 
we also were able to utilize more state and federal income tax credits in net income 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in our discontinued operations reflected a loss of thousand  or per diluted share  in  compared with a loss of thousand  or per diluted share  in including discontinued operations  net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year ended december  weeks  compared with fiscal year ended december  weeks net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
net sales of our carpet products increased and net sales related to our carpet yarn and carpet dyeing and finishing services decreased 
compared with  net sales of residential carpet increased and net sales of commercial carpet increased 
our net sales were negatively affected by significant weakness in the carpet industry  particularly during the last half of the year and one less operating week in  compared with adjusting for the extra operating week in  our net sales of carpet products rose in dollars and in units in  compared to the previous year 
our carpet sales continued to outpace the carpet industry  where sales of carpet declined in dollars and in units  compared with the prior year 
we believe the improvement in our net sales is principally attributable to our focus on high end markets and our continuing development of new and differentiated products 
our carpet yarn processing and carpet dyeing and finishing services are not significant to our core business and their decrease had less than a effect on our total net sales 
cost of sales 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in  compared with  was principally attributable to costs related to start up of new tufting and modular carpet tile operations and higher levels of off quality production during the first half of the year 
a significant portion of the quality issues were related to outsourcing of tufting production prior to june when our new tufting facility began operating on a full schedule 
the year over year comparison was also affected by lifo inventory liquidations that reduced cost of sales by thousand in and thousand in page gross profit 
the percentage point decline in gross profit as a percent of sales was attributable to the cost increases described above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased thousand in  compared with  due to tight control of discretionary spending 
the decrease of these expenses as a percentage of net sales to in  compared with in  reflects the lower levels of spending and higher net sales in other operating income 
other operating income increased thousand in due to insurance settlements and refunds that more than offset lower gains from the sale of operating assets 
other operating expense

the capital expenditures in included a new distribution center and tufting facility  equipment to produce modular carpet tile and investments in new manufacturing technology 
we expect capital expenditures in the million to million range in  while depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
capital expenditures in will be primarily for newer manufacturing technology and  to a lesser extent  information systems 
in  we amended our senior loan and security agreement to increase the limit on revolver loans from million to million  increase our flexibility to repurchase common stock or pay dividends  and increase the level of permitted purchase money debt as defined in the loan agreement from million to million

the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this agreement was at december  and at december  commitment fees ranging from to per annum are payable on the average daily unused balance of the revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on a portion of the borrowings under the senior loan and security agreement is fixed by an interest rate swap arrangement that effectively sets the interest rate on million of borrowings under the senior loan and security agreement at plus applicable credit spreads
