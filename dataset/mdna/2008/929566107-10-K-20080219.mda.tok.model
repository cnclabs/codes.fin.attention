item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to strengthen wabash 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our credit facility  and contractual commitments 
continuing  we provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through our retail branch network 
as part of our commitment to expand our customer base and grow our market leadership  we acquired transcraft corporation on march  transcraft s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements in the manufacturing segment from the date of acquisition 
executive summary measured in terms of process yield  productivity and operating effectiveness  was the best year in our history 
unfortunately  market requirements declined from  which resulted in lower revenues and gross profits 
in  we were able to achieve selected price increases despite a soft market and successfully recovered increased cost in our raw materials commodities 
we took early and effective actions to control costs in light of a weakening trailer market 
we made significant progress toward optimizing the effectiveness and utility of the erp system we implemented in we expect the overall trailer market for to decline further from and then recover in we continue to focus on the improvement of our manufacturing and retail operations  expanding our customer base  introducing products that meet customers needs  exiting non core operations and strengthening our capital structure 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective of being better today than yesterday  and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we have made improvements to our total recordable incident rate resulting in a reduction in our workers compensation costs in compared to we maintain iso 
table of contents registration of our environmental management system 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield py 
py is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
in  py trended positively  exceeding our performance by 
this was due in large part to the integration of our erp solution 
external performance 
we actively measure and track our warranty claims and costs 
one metric monitored  warranty claims reported within the first three months  improved dramatically from approximately six claims per trailers in to less than three in we utilize this information  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
through these efforts  we continue to realize improved quality  which resulted in decreasing rates of warranty payments for the last four years 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our inventory turns  which is a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency  to approximately eight and ten turns per year in and  respectively 
cost reduction 
since introduction in  we have completed over documented continuous improvement ci events 
in  we focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub assembly areas  improving material flow and inventory levels within our supply chain  and waste reduction in key support areas 
we deployed a six sigma team to work on key waste reduction initiatives across the enterprise 
we also deployed a shop floor problem solving tool to enhance a culture of daily continuous improvement 
we believe the improvements generated to date serve as the foundation for enhanced performance going forward 
industry trends freight transportation in the us  according to the ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in the latest such information available 
ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment  accounting for approximately of freight industry revenue in the us trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
recent trends we have observed include the following transportation trailer cycle 
transportation  including trucking  is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last years 
truck freight tonnage  according to ata statistics  has been negative year over year since mid recent data suggests that while freight tonnage is not improving  it does not seem to be weakening 
the trailer industry generally follows transportation industry cycles 
the current cycle began in early when industry shipments totaled approximately  reached a peak in with shipments of approximately  and is believed to be approaching the bottom in act estimates shipments in amounted to approximately  units and will be approximately  in and  in our view is generally consistent with that of act 
age of trailer fleets 
during the three year period ending december  the latest such information available  the average age of the top publicly traded truckload motor carrier trailer fleets increased from years to years 
however  the average age of the total population remained relatively unchanged at approximately years 
the stability of overall fleet age suggests a replacement demand estimated at  per year 

table of contents new trailer orders 
according to act  quarterly industry order placement rates have experienced year over year declines in each of the last five quarters through the quarter ended december  total trailer orders in were  units  a decrease from the  units ordered in other developments 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include us federal truck emission regulations took effect on january   resulting in cleaner  yet less fuel efficient and more costly tractor engines 
trucking companies accelerated purchases of tractors prior to the effective date of the regulation  significantly reducing the historical trailer to tractor ratio of to in  additional emission regulations are scheduled to take effect which may result in reoccurrence of accelerated truck purchases  again reducing the trailer to tractor ratio 
we believe that on average the truck to trailer ratio is unlikely to return to prior historic norms 
continuing improvements in trailer quality resulting from technological advances like duraplate composite  higher trailer to tractor ratios resulting in fewer miles per trailer per year and the increased utilization of trailer tracking could result in reduced trailer demand 
truck driver shortages experienced over the past several years have constrained and are expected to continue to constrain freight market capacity growth 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to grow 
we therefore expect that the majority of freight will still be moved by truck 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit general and administrative expenses selling expenses impairment of goodwill income from operations interest expense foreign exchange  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income 
table of contents compared to net sales net sales in were billion  a decrease of million  or  compared to by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows in millions  except unit data year ended december  change sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailers units manufacturing retail and distribution total used trailers manufacturing segment sales for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decline in van sales of  units  or approximately million  due to weak market demand 
this decrease was partially offset by higher average selling prices for vans  which had a positive impact of million 
sales price improvements resulted from the effort to offset material price increases and a favorable product mix as we shipped a larger number of the higher priced refrigerated units and fewer lower priced freightpro  pup trailers and converter dollies in compared to sales of platform units decreased million compared to as the impact of owning transcraft for an additional two months was more than offset by the decline in volume 
retail and distribution segment sales were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to new and used trailer sales decreased million and million  respectively  compared to primarily as a result of the overall decline in the market 
parts and service sales were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to due to weak customer demand

offsetting these improvements was the 
table of contents decline in new trailer units sold in compared to additionally  we were able to regain operating efficiencies that were adversely impacted in as a result of implementing a new erp system 
transcraft s contributions to gross profit increased in from the prior year period due to transcraft having an additional two months in the current year 
retail and distribution segment gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to as a percentage of sales  gross profit margin was compared to in  primarily due to declines in new and used trailer unit sales and margins and reduced demand for parts and service 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in the decrease was largely due to reduction in salaries and other employee related costs which were slightly offset by increases in bad debt expense and legal and technology costs 
selling expenses selling expenses increased million to million in primarily due to an increase in employee related costs and the impact of reporting transcraft an additional two months in as compared to other income expense foreign exchange  net for includes million of accumulated foreign currency translation gains recognized as a result of the sale of our canadian branches 
upon finalization of this sale  the operational activities pertaining to this entity were considered substantially liquidated as of december   and  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 foreign currency translation  all accumulated foreign currency translation gains were recognized 
gain on debt extinguishment in of million represents the gain recognized on the extinguishment of million of our senior convertible notes  which were purchased at a discount to par value  net of related deferred debt issuance costs 
income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million compared to tax expense of million in the effective rate for was 
this rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate as it includes recognition of a portion of the benefit of certain tax deductions related to the liquidation of our canadian subsidiary of million 
as of december   we had million of remaining us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which will expire in if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations on use under irs rules 
in  we recognized the reversal of valuation allowance and reserves primarily resulting from the settlement of certain state income tax positions totaling million 
we also recognized million of valuation allowance against foreign losses incurred during the year 

table of contents compared to net sales net sales in were billion  an increase of million  or  compared to by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows in millions  except unit data year ended december  change sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailers units manufacturing retail and distribution total used trailers manufacturing segment sales in were billion  an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of million in sales  or approximately  units  from transcraft since the date of acquisition and increased average selling prices for van trailers as van unit volumes were flat 
the average selling prices for van trailers increased approximately from due to our ability to pass along a portion of the increases in material costs and changes in product mix as more higher priced refrigerated units and fewer lower priced convertible dollies and containers were sold compared to the prior year 
retail and distribution segment sales were million in  a decrease million  or  compared to new trailer sales in this segment decreased million and sales for parts and service declined million in primarily as a result of fewer retail outlets in operation during used trailer sales were comparable with the prior year although selling prices were less favorable in due to product mix 
gross profit gross profit in was million compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in compared to in as discussed below  both of our segments were impacted as follows in millions year ended december  change gross profit by segment manufacturing retail and distribution intercompany profit eliminations total gross profit manufacturing segment gross profit in decreased million or 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales was largely due to the impact of higher raw material costs  primarily steel and aluminum 
these were offset by gross profit contributions from transcraft of million since the date of acquisition 
additionally  the decrease was driven by manufacturing inefficiencies that arose in the second and third quarters of related to parts 
table of contents shortages and issues with inbound logistics that had a detrimental impact on scheduling and production 
these inefficiencies were primarily the result of issues arising from the implementation of our new erp system 
retail and distribution segment gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or compared to this was a result of lower sales  primarily driven by fewer retail outlets in as compared with the retail and distribution segment s gross profit as a percent of sales was in  compared to in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was largely due to the inclusion of million from transcraft since the date of acquisition  including million of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired 
outside professional fees related to erp implementation of million  higher stock based compensation costs of million  primarily the result of adoption of sfas no 
r  and million of additional amortization of our new erp system  also contributed to the increase 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease of million in employee compensation 
impairment of goodwill as part of the preparation of our financial statements  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  and determined that the goodwill within the retail and distribution reporting unit was impaired 
we determined that the book value of the reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair market value of the reporting unit as determined using the present value of expected future cash flows on the assessment date 
after calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit  it was determined that the recorded goodwill of million was impaired 
the goodwill impairment was the result of the revised outlook as determined by our budgeting process for future periods 
future periods are being impacted by recent changes in the pattern of used trailer grade activity by larger fleet operators resulting in longer trade cycles and increased levels of direct sales of used trailers by customers 
these changes impact both the profitability of used trailer sales and parts and services operations 
also impacting future periods is the continued reduction of our retail locations 
other income expense interest expense increased million  or  in to million due to increased average borrowings during the year as our cost of borrowing remained relatively flat 
income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million compared to a tax benefit of million in the effective rate for was 
this rate includes recognition of the reversal of valuation allowance and reserves  primarily resulting from the settlement of certain state income tax positions totaling million 
we also recognized million of valuation allowance against foreign losses incurred during the year 
as of december   we had approximately million of remaining us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which will expire in if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations on use under internal revenue service rules 
in  we determined that a portion of our previously reserved deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on criteria set forth in sfas no 
as a result  we reversed million of valuation allowance previously recorded and  additionally  we utilized million of net operating losses nol to offset income 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure today  our capital structure is comprised of a mix of equity and debt 
as of december   our debt to equity ratio is approximately our objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal 
table of contents working capital requirements  to fund capital expenditures  to be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities  to pay dividends and to fund potential stock repurchases 
debt amendment on march   we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement revolving facility with our lenders

the revolving facility also contains additional customary affirmative covenants and events of default  including among other events  certain cross defaults  business disruption  condemnation and change in ownership 

table of contents cash flow cash provided by operating activities in amounted to million compared to million in the increase was primarily a result of a million improvement in working capital offset by an million reduction in net income  adjusted for non cash items  as compared to the prior year period 
the following is a discussion of factors impacting certain working capital items in as compared to the prior year accounts receivable decreased million during compared to a decrease of million in days sales outstanding dso  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  was approximately days in compared to days in the improvement in dso was primarily due to the timing of collections 
inventory decreased million during compared to an increase of million in the decrease is primarily due to lower raw material inventories resulting from reduced trailer demand and improved inventory management 
prior year raw material inventory includes the impact of the advance procurement of tires required to ensure availability of product 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in compared to a decrease of million in the year over year change is due to lower raw material inventory levels  improved inventory management and lower production volume 
investing activities used million during compared to million in the decrease of million from the prior year was primarily due to the transcraft acquisition in the first quarter of the current year includes the additional purchase price payment of million based on transcraft s achievement of performance targets 
financing activities used million during  including million used to retire million of our senior convertible notes 
as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity  amounted to approximately million and total debt and lease obligations amounted to approximately million  including million of off balance sheet operating leases 
during  we are required to extinguish our senior convertible notes of which million aggregate principal amount were outstanding at december  we currently anticipate funding this extinguishment through cash on hand and available borrowings under the revolving facility 
after considering this extinguishment  we expect that in  we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and quarterly dividend payments 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to million for and is anticipated to be approximately million for spending in will primarily be targeted on cost reduction projects in our manufacturing facilities as we continue to implement our strategy of low cost production of quality trailers 
activities are currently underway at our transcraft facility in anna  illinois and at our trailer floor facility in harrison  arkansas to implement various continuous improvement and lean manufacturing initiatives 
evaluation of production costs at our main lafayette  indiana facility is in progress and the outcome of that evaluation may increase capital spending for above the million anticipated amount 
outlook according to the most recent act estimates  total trailer industry shipments for are expected to be down from to approximately  units 
act estimates that sales in will recover to levels or approximately  units 
the biggest concerns going into relate to the global economy  especially housing and construction related markets in the us management s expectation is that the trailer industry will soften further before starting to recover in the second half of the year 
by product type  act is estimating that van trailer shipments will be down approximately in compared to with the decline in reefer units being more pronounced than that of dry vans 
total van trailer 
table of contents shipments are expected to total  units in compared to  units in act is estimating that platform trailer shipments will decline approximately in the decrease in the demand for trailers reflect the weakness of truck freight  which has trended down since the latter part of as a result of general economic conditions and  more particularly  declines in new home construction and automotive 
we believe we are in a strong position in the industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailer maintenance costs  and we expect some expansion of our presence into the mid market carriers 
in  we added approximately new mid market customers accounting for orders of over  new trailers 
since implementing our mid market sales strategy four years ago  we have added new mid market customers accounting for orders for over  new trailers 
pricing will be difficult in due to weak demand and fierce competitive activity 
raw material and component costs are expected to continue to trend upward based on world commodity prices for oil  steel and aluminum 
as has been our policy  we will endeavor to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
we have a focus on continuing to develop innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition to increase profitability 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows in millions thereafter total debt excluding interest senior convertible notes bank revolver due total debt other operating leases total other other commercial commitments letters of credit purchase commitments residual guarantees total other commercial commitments total obligations residual guarantees represent commitments related to certain new trailer sales transactions prior to  where we had entered into agreements to guarantee end of term residual value 
the agreements also contain an option for us to purchase the used equipment at a predetermined price 
we have purchase options of million on the aforementioned trailers 
operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments 
we have million in purchase commitments through june for aluminum  which is within normal production requirements 

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions balance sheet caption item required approaches used key factors other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventories lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and other assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required periodically to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates discount rate deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to 
table of contents variation  particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant impact on our business 
new accounting pronouncements income taxes on january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb final interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
we have no adjustment to report in respect of the effect of adoption of fin our policy with respect to interest and penalties associated with reserves or allowances for uncertain tax positions is to classify such interest and penalties in income tax expense in the statements of operations 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits computed under fin was approximately million  all of which  if recognized  would impact our effective income tax rate 
as of december   we had recorded a total of million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
we foresee no significant changes to the facts and circumstances underlying its reserves and allowances for uncertain income tax positions as reasonably possible during the next months 
as of december   we are subject to unexpired statutes of limitation for us federal income taxes for the years we are also subject to unexpired statutes of limitation for indiana state income taxes for the years fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
the statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities 
it does not expand the use of fair value measurement 
in february  the fasb agreed to defer the effective date to fiscal years beginning after november   for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
for these financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at least annually  this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value option in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 

table of contents a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through june for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
for  we maintained an average floating rate borrowing level of million under our revolving line of credit 
based on this average borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would not have a material impact to interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes
