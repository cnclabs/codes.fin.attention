in may  we sold  units for per unit in a public offering 
each unit consisted of two shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock 
an additional  units were sold to cover over allotments 
of the  shares of our common stock included in the over allotment units   were offered by a selling stockholder and we did not receive any proceeds from that portion of the over allotment 
we also issued to the underwriter of the public offering a warrant to purchase 
table of contents  units for a price of per unit 
prior to the redemption described below  the warrants issued as part of the units had an exercise price of and were exercisable until may  beginning november   we had the right to redeem some or all of the warrants at a price of per warrant at anytime after the closing price for our common stock equaled or exceeded per share for any five consecutive trading days by giving certain notice to the then warrant holders 
in march  we exercised our redemption rights by sending notices to holders of the outstanding public warrants issued in the may offering 
pursuant to the redemption notice  holders of the public warrants were given the opportunity to exercise their warrants until the close of business on april  after april   we redeemed any unexercised public warrants at a price of per warrant 
as a result   warrants were exercised in march resulting in gross proceeds of  and  warrants were exercised in april resulting in gross proceeds of million 
we paid  to redeem  warrants which were not exercised during the redemption period 
on april   we entered into a financing agreement financing agreement with rosenthal rosenthal  inc rosenthal for additional working capital 
under the financing agreement  rosenthal made a term loan in the principal amount of million to us and has additionally agreed to provide up to an additional million under a revolving line of credit 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the financing agreement is payable at variable rates of interest over the published jpmorgan chase prime rate  on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our obligations under the term loan are evidenced by a secured term note and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we are required to maintain certain collateral ratios and financial covenants under the agreement 
at december  the company was in violation of these covenants and received a waiver from the lender 
we believe that we will be in compliance with these ratios and covenants throughout the financing agreement terminates on march  unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement 
in connection with the financing agreement  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the closing date of the transaction to rosenthal

the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from three primary sources subscriptions to our web services  data licenses and solutions and advertising and other e commerce based revenues 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically twelve months 
revenue from data licenses is recognized over the term of the contract 
our data solutions sometimes involve some upfront one time customization fees  which to date have been immaterial  along with more traditional annual data licensing arrangements for the ongoing delivery of the data solution 
in addition  some of our data solutions are billed on a time materials basis  per service level agreements or for delivery of data 
revenue from time materials based agreements and data delivery are recognized as the data and services are provided 
advertising and e commerce revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance  and delivery if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 
several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectibility of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these evaluations include assumptions regarding future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas  accounting for stock based compensation in our consolidated financial statements 
under sfas r  the company is required to recognize compensation expense for all employee and director stock based compensation awards based on estimated grant date fair values 
the company estimates the fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires the company to make assumptions about the expected life of options  stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend yields 
the company recognizes the expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adopting sfas r  the company estimated expected forfeitures over the life of each individual award and included the impact of these expected forfeitures in stock based compensation expense 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations  and statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements

revised requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired 
this standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies 
fas revised applies prospectively to business combinations and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the impact that sfas no 
r will have on the company s consolidated financial statements when effective will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions completed after the effective date as well as the accounting for income taxes on prior acquisitions 
statement no 
requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated net income should include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income
