item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations throughout this section  our fiscal years ended december   december  and january  are referred to as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal includes information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  the risk factors and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading sporting goods retailer in the western united states  operating stores in states under the name big sporting goods at december  we provide a full line product offering in a traditional sporting goods store format that averages approximately  square feet 
our product mix includes athletic shoes  apparel and accessories  as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports  fitness  camping  hunting  fishing  tennis  golf  snowboarding and in line skating 
we believe that over our year history we have developed a reputation with the competitive and recreational sporting goods customer as a convenient neighborhood sporting goods retailer that consistently delivers value on quality merchandise 
our stores carry a wide range of products at competitive prices from well known brand name manufacturers  including nike  reebok  adidas  new balance  wilson  spalding  under armour and columbia 
we also offer brand name merchandise produced exclusively for us  private label merchandise and specials on quality items we purchase through opportunistic buys of vendor over stock and close out merchandise 
we reinforce our value reputation through weekly print advertising in major and local newspapers and mailers designed to generate customer traffic  drive net sales and build brand awareness 
throughout our history  we have emphasized controlled growth 
the following table summarizes our store count for the periods presented fiscal year big sporting goods stores beginning of period new stores stores relocated stores closed end of period new stores opened per year  net stores that are relocated are classified as new stores 
sales from the prior location are treated as sales from a closed store and thus are excluded from same store sales calculations 
executive summary net income for fiscal declined to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the decline was driven primarily by lower than anticipated sales  including a reduction in same store sales of 
lower than anticipated sales also resulted in an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales  the effect of which was partially offset by lower interest expense 

table of contents net sales for fiscal increased to million 
the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in new store sales  offset by a decrease of million in same store sales and million in closed store sales 
gross profit for fiscal represented of net sales  which was equal to the prior year 
the favorable impact of a basis point increase in product selling margins and lower distribution center costs was offset by a reduction in costs capitalized into inventory and higher store occupancy expense 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased by basis points to 
the increase was due mainly to lower than anticipated sales levels combined with higher costs related to opening new stores and for advertising 
operating income for fiscal declined to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to negative expense leverage as a result of lower than anticipated sales levels 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations by dollar and as a percentage of our net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income other financial data net sales change same store sales change net income change historically  we have presented total depreciation and amortization expense separately on the face of our consolidated statement of operations and our corporate headquarters occupancy costs within cost of sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our classification of distribution center and store occupancy depreciation and amortization expense to cost of sales and store equipment and corporate headquarters depreciation and amortization expense to selling and administrative expense 
depreciation and amortization expense is no longer presented separately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the corporate headquarters occupancy costs are now included in selling and administrative expense 
we reclassified prior period consolidated statements of operations data and related discussion and analysis to conform to the current year presentation  which increased cost of sales and decreased gross profit by million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and increased selling and administrative expense by million and million for fiscal and  respectively  from amounts previously reported 
this reclassification had no effect on the company s previously reported operating or net income  consolidated balance sheets  consolidated 
table of contents statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows  and is not considered material to any previously reported consolidated financial statements for any of the years presented 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  net of discounts or allowances earned  freight  inventory shrinkage  buying  distribution center costs and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  amortization of leasehold improvements  common area maintenance  property taxes and insurance 
selling and administrative expense includes store related expense  other than store occupancy costs  as well as advertising  depreciation and amortization and expense associated with operating our corporate headquarters 
same store sales for a period reflect net sales from stores operated throughout that period as well as the corresponding prior period  eg  two comparable annual reporting periods for annual comparisons 
lower net income for fiscal reflects costs for commencement of operations at our new larger distribution center and costs associated with the restatement of our prior period consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in new store sales  offset by a decrease of million in same store sales and million in closed store sales 
the increase in new store sales reflected the opening of new stores  net of closures and relocations  since january  same store sales decreased for fiscal compared with fiscal this decrease in same store sales for fiscal was primarily attributable to a challenging consumer environment impacted by high gas prices  increased home mortgage defaults and other macroeconomic concerns  which in turn weakened customer traffic into our retail stores 
this challenging consumer environment is continuing into fiscal additionally  our net sales results reflected a significant deterioration in the performance of the roller shoe product category  which declined approximately million from the prior year 
roller shoe sales are expected to continue to weaken in fiscal we opened new stores  net of closures and relocations  in fiscal  increasing our store count at the end of fiscal to versus at the end of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the following product selling margins for fiscal  which exclude buying  store occupancy and distribution center costs  increased approximately basis points versus fiscal  primarily due to sales of winter merchandise earlier in the winter season at higher margins and improved margins for various other product categories 
margins in fiscal for the roller shoe product category were lower versus the prior year and are expected to continue to decline in fiscal distribution center costs for fiscal decreased by million  or basis points  due primarily to additional costs in the first quarter of fiscal associated with completing the transition to our new distribution center and operational efficiencies realized in fiscal in our new distribution center 
distribution center costs capitalized into inventory for fiscal decreased by million  or basis points  due primarily to higher costs in the prior year associated with the transition to our new larger distribution center 
store occupancy costs for fiscal increased by million  or basis points  due mainly to new store openings  higher lease renewal costs and increases in property maintenance fees 
inventory reserve provisions for fiscal increased million  or basis points  due primarily to higher provisions for the realizability of the value of returned goods inventory and inventory shrink 
selling and administrative expense 
selling and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to the following store related expense  excluding occupancy  increased by million  or basis points  due primarily to an increase in store count and an increase of million in purchasing card transaction fees as a result of 
table of contents higher sales and the trend toward increased purchasing card usage by consumers  combined with the favorable impact in fiscal of million resulting from the settlement of a class action lawsuit related to purchasing card fees 
advertising expense for fiscal increased by million to support overall sales growth and to provide advertising coverage for our new stores 
administrative expense for fiscal increased million  reflecting increased labor related costs to support our continuing growth and financial reporting initiatives 
the increase in administrative expense includes a reduction in professional fees of million versus the prior year 
professional fees in fiscal were higher due primarily to legal and audit fees incurred to complete the company s fiscal internal control and financial statement audits 
the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal is due in part to softer sales conditions in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense primarily reflects lower average debt levels in fiscal of approximately million 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the growth in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase of million in same store sales and an increase of million in new store sales  net of sales for closed stores  which reflected the opening of new stores  net of relocations  since january  net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal included million related to our initial recognition of gift card breakage gift cards sold and store merchandise credits issued where the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
gift card breakage for fiscal totaled million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
same store sales increased for fiscal compared with fiscal store count at the end of fiscal was versus at the end of fiscal as we opened new stores in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the following product selling margins for fiscal  which exclude buying  store occupancy and distribution center costs  increased basis points versus fiscal distribution center costs for fiscal increased by million  or basis points  due primarily to the commencement of operations at our new larger distribution center  higher labor related costs and increased trucking expense  related in part to higher gasoline prices 
depreciation expense increased million over fiscal distribution center costs capitalized into inventory for fiscal decreased million  or basis points  compared to fiscal store occupancy costs increased by million over fiscal  due mainly to new store openings 
store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points due to higher sales in fiscal inventory reserve provisions for fiscal decreased million  or basis points  from the prior year due primarily to a lower provision for shrink offset partially by an increased provision for the realizability of the value of returned goods 
selling and administrative expense 
selling and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative costs was primarily attributable to the following store related expense  excluding occupancy  increased by million due primarily to an increase in store count  but declined basis points as a percentage of net sales as store labor savings  due in part to 
table of contents merchandise delivery efficiencies provided by our new distribution center and higher sales for fiscal  allowed leveraging of this expense 
store related expense in fiscal was favorably impacted by our receipt of million resulting from the settlement of a class action lawsuit relating to purchasing card fees 
advertising expense increased by million in fiscal due primarily to increased newspaper advertising costs  but declined basis points as a percentage of net sales 
administrative expense for fiscal also reflected increased labor related costs of million  or basis points  to support our continuing growth and internal control initiatives  and stock based compensation expense of million  or basis points  due to our implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on january  legal and audit expense decreased by million  or basis points  in fiscal as a result of higher costs incurred in fiscal associated with the restatement of our prior period consolidated financial statements 
other income 
in fiscal  we recorded proceeds from the settlement of a claim related to the required relocation of one of our stores  which was located on land acquired by a city redevelopment agency through eminent domain proceedings 
settlement proceeds totaled million  of which million was recorded as other income and million was recorded in selling and administrative expense primarily as a reduction in legal fees incurred in connection with this eminent domain proceeding 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense primarily reflects the impact of higher short term interest rates partially offset by lower average debt levels 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and cash dividends 
we fund our liquidity requirements primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash on hand  future funds from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for at least the next twelve months 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we ended fiscal with million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million in fiscal the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year dollars in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the seasonality of our business historically provides greater cash flow from operations during the holiday and winter selling season  with fourth quarter sales traditionally generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
typically  we use operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund inventory increases in anticipation of the holidays and our inventory levels are at their highest in the months leading up to christmas 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 

table of contents our cash flow for fiscal was below fiscal which contributed to higher long term debt levels year over year 
for fiscal we purchased larger quantities of inventory earlier in the year to insure adequate product availability for the holiday and winter selling season 
accounts payable attributable to such inventory purchases were paid by fiscal year end resulting in substantially lower accounts payable leverage compared to the prior year 
the higher inventory levels and timing of purchases combined with lower than anticipated sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in reduced operating cash flow for the year 
also contributing to the higher debt levels for fiscal were amounts paid to repurchase our stock and higher capital expenditures 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects lower net income in fiscal and increased funding for working capital versus the prior year 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  was million at the end of fiscal  up from million at the end of fiscal the increase in working capital is primarily due to higher levels of merchandise inventories at the end of the year associated with lower than anticipated sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal this cash flow effect of purchasing more merchandise inventory and paying for the inventory earlier in the year  thereby reducing accounts payable  was partially offset by a reduction in prepaid expense due primarily to the timing of rent payments 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures  excluding non cash acquisitions  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
capital spending primarily reflects new store openings  store related remodeling  distribution center costs and computer hardware and software purchases 
capital expenditures by category as a percentage of total capital expenditures for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows fiscal year new stores store related remodels distribution center computer hardware  software and other total for fiscal and  capital expenditures were primarily for opening new stores including new stores  net of closures and relocations  in fiscal and new stores in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal also included amounts related to the implementation of computer system improvements to support our infrastructure 
higher capital expenditures in fiscal included amounts related to opening our new distribution center 
capital expenditures for new stores were lower in fiscal  reflecting the opening of new stores  net of closures and relocations 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million  net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million and net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million 
for fiscal  cash provided by borrowings under our revolving credit facility was used primarily to repurchase stock and pay dividends 
for fiscal  cash was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility  prepay our outstanding term loan and pay dividends 
for fiscal  borrowings under our revolving credit facility increased to fund capital expenditures for our new distribution center  pay down our term loan and pay dividends 
as of december   we had revolving credit borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement 
these balances compare to borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement as of december  we prepaid million of our term loan in the second quarter of fiscal and we prepaid the remaining million of our term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal our revolving credit facility balances have historically increased from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter and from the end of the third quarter to the week of thanksgiving 
the historical increases in our 
table of contents revolving credit facility balances reflect the build up in inventory in anticipation of our summer and winter selling seasons 
revolving credit facility balances typically fall from the week of thanksgiving to the end of the fourth quarter  reflecting inventory sales during the holiday and winter selling season 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  debt levels did not decrease as much as expected due to lower than anticipated sales levels 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an increase of the dividend to an annual rate of per share of outstanding common stock 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in the remainder of fiscal and during fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of february  periodically  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons  including the current market price of our stock  to offset dilution related to equity based compensation plans and optimizing our capital structure 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under this program  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  at which time the program was completed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the authorization  we may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
however  the timing and amount of such purchases  if any  would be at the discretion of management  and would depend upon market conditions and other considerations 
under this program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal future capital requirements 
we had cash on hand of million at december  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding non cash acquisitions  to range from approximately million to million  primarily to fund the opening of approximately new stores  net of closures and relocations  store related remodeling  distribution center equipment  corporate office and distribution center improvements and computer hardware and software purchases 
as of february   a total of million remained available for share repurchases under our share repurchase program 
we consider several factors in determining when and if we make share repurchases including  among other things  our alternative cash requirements and the market price of our stock 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of february  we believe we will be able to fund our future cash requirements from cash on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to continue our operations and planned capital expenditures  satisfy our payments under debt obligations  repurchase our stock and pay quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to satisfy such cash requirements depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
see item a  risk factors included in this annual report on form k 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations  discontinue repurchasing our stock  suspend dividend payments or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to effect successful alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
our material off balance sheet arrangements are operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
we excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

table of contents our future obligations and commitments as of december   include the following payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations lease commitments operating lease commitments other occupancy costs other liabilities revolving credit facility letters of credit total periodic interest payments on the revolving credit facility are not included in the table above because interest expense is based on a variable index  either libor or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate  and the balance of the revolving credit facility fluctuates daily depending on operating  investing and financing cash flows 
assuming no changes in our revolving credit facility debt or interest rates as of fiscal year end  our projected interest payments in fiscal or any fiscal year would be approximately million 
capital lease obligations consist principally of leases for our distribution center delivery trailers and management information systems hardware 
payments for these lease obligations are provided for by cash flows generated from operations or through borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our retail store facilities  distribution center and corporate office 
these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
with respect to most of those leases  we intend to renegotiate those leases as they expire 
other occupancy costs include property maintenance fees and property taxes for our stores  distribution center and corporate headquarters 
other liabilities consist principally of an employment agreement obligation for robert w 
miller  co founder of the company  and an asset retirement obligation related to the removal of leasehold improvements from our stores upon termination of our store leases 
letters of credit are related primarily to importing merchandise and funding insurance program liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery 
because most of these purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled  they are not included as outstanding contractual obligations 
financing agreement 
on december   we entered into a million financing agreement with the cit group business credit  inc and a syndicate of other lenders 
on may   we amended the financing agreement to  among other things  increase the line of credit to million  consisting of a non amortizing million revolving credit facility and an amortizing term loan balance of million 
the amortizing term loan balance was prepaid in full during  and the revolving credit facility commitment increased million from million to million 
the initial termination date of the revolving credit facility is march  subject to annual extensions thereafter 
the revolving credit facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least days prior written notice before any anniversary date  commencing with its anniversary date on march  we may terminate the revolving credit facility by giving at least days prior written notice  provided that if we terminate prior to march   we must pay an early termination fee 
unless it is terminated  the revolving credit facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date beginning on march  the revolving credit facility bears interest at various rates based on our overall borrowings  with a floor of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate 

table of contents the following table provides information about borrowings under our financing agreement as of and for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands fiscal year end balance average interest rate maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year our financing agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
our financing agreement contains various financial and other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to in certain circumstances  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or to create various liens and restrict the amount of capital expenditures that we may incur 
our financing agreement also restricts our ability to engage in mergers or acquisitions  sell assets  repurchase our stock or pay dividends 
we may repurchase our stock or declare a dividend only if no default or event of default exists and a default is not expected to result from the payment of the dividend and certain other criteria are met  which may include the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants under our financing agreement 
if we fail to make any required payment under our financing agreement or if we otherwise default under this instrument  our debt may be accelerated under this agreement 
this acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
those consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and drawn from historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
management believes that the following accounting estimates reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are made up of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method that approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
average cost includes the direct purchase price of merchandise inventory and allocated overhead costs associated with our distribution center 
management regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and we record a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
because of our merchandise mix  we have not historically experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence 
however  these reserves are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual results if future economic conditions  consumer demand and competitive environments differ from our expectations 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation may be materially inaccurate at this time 
inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends 
we perform physical inventories at each of our stores at least once per year and cycle count inventories encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter at our distribution center 
the reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each store since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by store and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and can vary from actual results 
as of december  and december   our inventory valuation reserves represent less than of our merchandise inventory 

table of contents vendor allowances we receive allowances for cooperative advertising and volume purchase rebates earned through programs with certain vendors 
we establish a receivable for these allowances which are earned but not yet received 
amounts relating to the purchase of merchandise are treated as a reduction of inventory and reduce cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction in selling and administrative expense 
we perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate amount of vendor allowances to be applied as a reduction of merchandise cost and selling and administrative expense 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we review our long lived assets and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are reviewed for recoverability at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  usually at the store level 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not considered recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the asset is determined not to be recoverable  then it is considered to be impaired and the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during fiscal years  and  our evaluation resulted in long lived asset impairment charges which were not material 
goodwill is not amortized but evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing is based upon our market capitalization  taking into consideration the current market price of our stock  and the carrying amount of the reporting unit is based upon our net assets 
during fiscal years  and  our evaluation concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
stock based compensation plan beginning in fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value at the date of grant of stock options granted under our equity and stock incentive performance plan which requires the input of assumptions 
these fair value assumptions include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate  the market price of our stock and the expected term in which employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based upon historical employee turnover patterns to determine our estimates of compensation expense 
changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate of the options and consequently the related compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
self insurance reserves we maintain self insurance programs for our workers compensation liability risks 
we are self insured up to specified per occurrence limits and maintain insurance coverage for losses in excess of specified amounts 
estimated costs under these programs  including incurred but not reported claims  are recorded as expense based upon historical experience  trends of paid and incurred claims  and other actuarial assumptions 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results may be significantly impacted 
seasonality and impact of inflation we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results and typically generate higher operating income in the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday selling season as well as the winter sports selling season 
as a result  we incur significant additional expense in the fourth quarter due to normally higher purchase 
table of contents volumes and increased staffing 
seasonality influences our buying patterns which directly impacts our merchandise and accounts payable levels and cash flows 
we purchase merchandise for seasonal activities in advance of a season 
if we miscalculate the demand for our products generally or for our product mix during the fourth quarter  our net sales can decline  resulting in excess inventory  which can harm our financial performance 
because a larger portion of our operating income is typically derived from our fourth quarter net sales  a shortfall in expected fourth quarter net sales can negatively impact our annual operating results 
our net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were lower than expected which contributed to lower operating income compared to the same period last year and higher inventory levels 
we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our operating results for the three preceding fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
in fiscal we are experiencing increasing inflation in the purchase cost of certain products 
if we are unable to adjust our selling prices then our product selling margins will decline  which could adversely impact our operating results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
there are numerous previously issued statements dealing with fair values that are amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in december  the fasb also issued staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after november   for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the fasb believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities  and would require entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the use of a simplified method  as discussed in the previously issued sab  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
in particular  the sec staff indicated in sab that it will accept a company s election to use the simplified method  regardless of whether the company has sufficient information to make more refined estimates of expected term 
at the time sab was issued  the sec staff believed that more detailed external information about employee exercise behavior eg  employee exercise patterns by industry and or other categories of companies would  over time  become readily available to companies 
therefore  the sec staff stated in sab 
table of contents that it would not expect a company to use the simplified method for share option grants after december  the sec staff understands that such detailed information about employee exercise behavior may not be widely available by december  accordingly  the sec staff will continue to accept  under certain circumstances  the use of the simplified method beyond december  upon our adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to use  and are currently using  the simplified method to estimate our expected term 
we are evaluating whether or not to continue to use the simplified method  which will depend upon whether or not sufficient exercise history exists upon which to base an estimate  in addition to how easily peer group information may be obtained 
the issuance of sab did not impact our consolidated financial statements for fiscal in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no
