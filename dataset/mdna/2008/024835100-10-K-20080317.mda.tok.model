item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company and our business overview we are one of the largest owners  managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the united states in terms of beds owned and under management 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit with expertise in the acquisition  design  financing  development  construction management  leasing and management of student housing properties 
in january  we acquired a unit  bed property village on sixth located near the campus of marshall university in huntington  west virginia  for a purchase price of million  which excludes million of transaction costs  initial integration expenses and capital expenditures necessary to bring this property up to our operating standards 
as part of the transaction  we assumed two fixed rate mortgage loans  which includes one for million with an annual interest rate of and remaining term to maturity of years and a second loan for million with an annual interest rate of and remaining term to maturity of years 
in february  we acquired a three property portfolio the edwards portfolio for a purchase price of million  which excludes million of transaction costs  initial integration expenses and capital expenditures necessary to bring these properties up to our operating standards 
as part of the transaction  we assumed million in fixed rate mortgage debt with a weighted average annual interest rate of and an average remaining term to maturity of years 
in august  construction was completed on an additional phase at one of these properties 
as contemplated in the original transaction  concurrent with the completion of construction in august  we purchased this additional phase consisting of units and beds  for approximately million 
the edwards portfolio consists of one property in lexington  kentucky located near the campus of the university of kentucky  one property in toledo  ohio located near the campus of the university of toledo and one property in ypsilanti  michigan located near the campus of eastern michigan university 
including the purchase of the additional phase discussed above  these three properties contain units and  beds 
in february  we acquired a unit  bed property pirate s place located near the campus of east carolina university in greenville  north carolina  for a purchase price of million  which excludes million of anticipated transaction costs  initial integration expenses and capital expenditures necessary to bring this property up to our operating standards 
as part of the transaction  we assumed million in fixed rate mortgage debt with an annual interest rate of and remaining term to maturity of years 
in february  we also acquired a unit  bed property sunnyside commons located near the campus of west virginia university in morgantown  west virginia  for a purchase price of million  which excludes million of anticipated transaction costs  initial integration expenses and capital expenditures necessary to bring this property up to our operating standards 
we did not assume any debt as part of this transaction 
property portfolio as of december   our total property portfolio contained student housing properties with approximately  beds and  apartment units  all of which we manage 
these communities contain modern housing units  offer resort style amenities and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student oriented programming 
our property portfolio includes wholly owned properties  which consists of owned off campus properties that are in close proximity to colleges and universities in states  of which one is currently under construction  and two owned on campus properties currently under construction 
the net operating income of these student housing communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels and is affected by our ability to control operating costs 
our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired student housing communities 
we create long term stockholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire student housing communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable 
the construction of our two owned on campus properties are funded with our equity through the ace program which enables colleges and universities to preserve their credit capacity to fund core academic infrastructure 
each of these properties will operate under a ground facility lease with a related university system 
additionally  we participate with two university systems in the ownership of four on campus properties under long term ground facility leases  we refer to these properties as our on campus participating properties 
third party development and management services we also provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities  c foundations and others 
our clients have included some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the state university of new york system  the university of california system  the university of houston system  the texas a m university system  the texas state university system  the university of georgia system  the university of north carolina system  the purdue university system  the university of colorado system  and the west virginia university system 
we have developed student housing properties for these clients and a majority of the time have been retained to manage these properties following their opening 
since  we have developed and assisted in securing financing for third party student housing properties 
as of december   we were under contract on four projects that are currently in progress and whose fees range from million to million 
as of december   fees of approximately million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects  which have scheduled completion dates of july through march we also provide third party management and leasing services for properties that represent approximately  beds in approximately  units  seven of which we developed 
our third party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to multi year management contracts that have an initial term that ranges from one to five years 
as of december   our total owned and managed portfolio included properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units 
we believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities present an attractive long term investment opportunity for our investors 
we intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated  typically highly amenitized  student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and or are under serviced in terms of existing on and or off campus student housing 
while fee revenue from our third party development  construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities  this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify  close  and successfully operate student housing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development and management services development revenues are generally recognized based on a proportionate performance method based on contract deliverables  while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs 
costs associated with such projects are deferred and recognized in relation to the revenues earned on executed contracts 
for projects where our fee is based on a fixed price  any cost overruns incurred during construction  as compared to the original budget  will reduce the net fee generated on those projects 
incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
we also evaluate the collectibility of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances  including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects  and reserves any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred  until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and or construction will commence 
because we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained  we bear the risk of loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
as such  management evaluates the status of third party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues 
such write offs are included in third party development and management services expenses in the case of third party development projects or general and administrative expenses in the case of owned development projects on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
third party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts  revenues or a fixed monthly amount  in accordance with the applicable management contract 
incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria are anticipated to be met 
student housing rental revenue recognition and accounts receivable student housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze the aging of resident receivables  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income 
allocation of fair value to acquired properties the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes  among other items  determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  in place tenant leases  and any debt assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases generally less than one year 
long lived assets impairment on a periodic basis  management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income 
outperformance bonus plan the outperformance bonus plan was adopted upon consummation of our ipo in august  and consisted of awards to key employees equal to the value of  shares of our common stock 
compensation related to these awards was not recorded until when management determined that certain of the required performance measures were probable of achievement 
such awards vested on the third anniversary of the ipo august  upon our achievement of specified performance measures 
upon vesting  the compensation committee of the board of directors exercised its permitted discretion and granted  of the awards to selected recipients in the form of pius  with the remainder of the awards paid in cash in the amount of million 
a compensation charge of approximately million was recorded during the year ended december   to reflect the value of such awards 
as a result of our october equity offering discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  a book up event occurred for tax purposes  resulting in the  pius being converted to common units of the operating partnership 
construction property savings and fire proceeds an entity formed by our predecessor owners was entitled to any savings in the budgeted completion cost of three of our owned off campus construction properties that were completed in fall in february  our predecessor owners received such funds 
additionally  in april  our predecessor owners received insurance proceeds originally received by us in connection with the fire that occurred at the university village at fresno in these payments were accounted for as equity distributions 
capital expenditures we distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property 
acquisition related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets 
the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as the funds are not available to us for current use 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods

new property operations 
in january we acquired village on sixth and in february and august we acquired the edwards portfolio 
in march  we also acquired the property royal portfolio  consisting of  beds 
finally  in august  we completed construction of and opened callaway villas and in august we completed construction of and opened university centre 
these new properties contributed million of additional revenues and million of additional operating expenses in as compared to same store property operations excluding new property activity 
we had properties containing  beds which were operating during both and these properties produced revenues of million and million during and  respectively  an increase of million 
excluding resident services revenues  which are provided through our trs subsequent to our ipo  these properties produced revenues of million during  as compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates and other income during as compared to  which was offset by a slight decrease in average occupancy rates from in to in revenues in will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the academic year at our various properties during our leasing period  which typically begins in january and ends in august 
at these existing properties  operating expenses increased by million  to million in as compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in maintenance costs  payroll and bad debt expense  offset by utility savings and marketing cost savings related to our early lease up for the academic year 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  insurance costs  property taxes and general inflation 
on campus participating properties ocpp operations same store ocpp operations 
we had four on campus participating properties containing  beds which were operating during both and revenues from our same store on campus participating properties increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average occupancy from in to in  as well as an increase in average rental rates 
at these existing properties  operating expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in maintenance costs incurred at one of our on campus participating properties and an increase in bad debt expense at another one of our on campus participating properties 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  insurance costs and general inflation 
third party development services revenue third party development services revenue decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to fewer projects in progress during as compared to we had seven projects in progress during with an average contractual fee of approximately million  as compared to in which we had nine projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately million 
we anticipate third party development services revenue to increase in due to awards in that are expected to commence during development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects  the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project 
in addition  to the extent projects are completed under budget  we may be entitled to a portion of such savings  which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
it is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs 
the pre development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then current period 
third party management services revenue third party management services revenues increased by million from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of the commencement of four management contracts in august and four management contracts in the fourth quarter of  which was offset by the discontinuation of the texas state university system management contracts in july we anticipate that third party management services revenues in will increase as compared with  primarily as a result of the previously mentioned contracts obtained during the fourth quarter of resident services resident services revenue represents revenue earned by our trs related to the provision of certain services to residents at our properties  such as food service  housekeeping  and resident programming activities 
these services are provided to the residents at market rates and under an agreement between the trs and the operating partnership  payments from residents are collected by the properties on behalf of the trs in conjunction with their collection of rents 
revenue from resident services increased approximately million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to additional revenue earned during from the acquired properties discussed above and the completion of construction and opening of callaway villas in august and university centre in august as a business strategy  our level of services provided to residents by the trs is only incidental to that which is necessary to maintain or increase occupancy 
we anticipate that resident services revenue will increase in as compared to as additional revenues are generated from the timing of acquisitions and development properties placed into service 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  from million in  to million in this increase was primarily due to a compensation charge of million recorded in related to the company s outperformance bonus plan  which is more fully discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
in addition  we experienced an increase in payroll and other related costs as a result of overall increases in corporate staffing levels due to the recent growth in our owned property portfolio from the property acquisitions and owned developments completed in and we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decrease in as a result of the million compensation charge recorded in  offset by anticipated increases in payroll and other related costs in as a result of the previously mentioned increases in corporate staffing levels experienced as a result of the recent growth of our owned portfolio and the expected closing of the mergers 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased approximately million from million in to million in this increase was due to the acquisition of four properties during the first quarter of  the acquisition of the property royal portfolio in march  the completion of construction and opening of an owned development project in august and the completion of construction and opening of another owned development project in august in conjunction with the acquisition of the four properties during the first quarter of and the property royal portfolio on march   a valuation was assigned to in place leases which was amortized over the remaining lease terms of the acquired leases generally less than one year 
this contributed million and million of additional depreciation and amortization expense in and  respectively  a decrease of million 
we expect depreciation and amortization in to increase from primarily due to a full year s depreciation on properties acquired and placed in service during  the million of recently completed acquisitions and the addition of the gmh properties to our portfolio 
amortization of deferred financing costs remained relatively constant at million for both and we expect amortization of deferred financing costs in to increase due to properties acquired in  the recently completed acquisitions and the addition of the gmh properties to our portfolio 
ground lease expense ground lease expense increased by million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of the refinancing of the cullen oaks loans in february  which reduced debt service expense and therefore increased the amount of cash flow available for distribution 
in addition  we experienced a significant decrease in vacancies at one of our other on campus participating properties which increased the amount of cash flow available for distribution 
interest income interest income increased by approximately million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to interest earned during on the remaining proceeds from our september equity offering and net proceeds from the disposition of an owned off campus property in december interest expense interest expense increased approximately million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to million of additional interest incurred in associated with debt assumed or incurred in connection with the previously mentioned and property acquisitions  net of the amortization of debt premiums and discounts recorded to reflect the market value of debt assumed 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in interest expense on our revolving credit facility as a result of a decrease in the weighted average balance from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  capitalized interest increased by million as a result of more owned properties being under development during as compared to we anticipate that interest expense in will increase from levels due to interest expense assumed or incurred in connection with property acquisitions and the mergers 
loss from unconsolidated joint venture we own an equity interest in a joint venture that owns a military housing privatization project with the united states navy  as discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
in december  the joint venture closed and obtained financing through taxable revenue bonds and our share of the loss from the joint venture is reflected under loss from unconsolidated joint venture in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  income taxes the income tax provision of million in is primarily the result of the write off of the company s deferred tax asset 
in august  in connection with the vesting of the company s outperformance bonus plan discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  a portion of the compensation expense associated with the awards was recorded by the trs 
as a result  it was determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset and increased the valuation allowance by a discrete item of million 
in addition  the texas governor signed into law a texas margin tax which restructured the state business tax by replacing the taxable capital components of the franchise tax with a taxable margin component 
the texas margin tax became effective in  and as a result  we incurred tax expense of approximately million for the year ended december  we are subject to federal  state and local income taxes as a result of the services provided by our trs  which include our third party services revenues  resident services revenues and the operations of our on campus participating properties 
as a result  the income earned by our trs  unlike our results from our owned properties  is subject to taxation 
the amount of income taxes to be recognized is dependent on the operating results of the trs 
minority interests the variance in minority interests is primarily due to the company s net loss position for as compared to the company s net income position for minority interests represent external partners in our operating partnership as well as certain third party partners in joint ventures consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  these external partners are allocated their share of income loss during the respective reporting periods discontinued operations statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

this contributed million and million of additional depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
amortization of deferred financing costs increased million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to debt assumed in connection with the previously mentioned royal portfolio acquisition and additional finance costs incurred in june related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease related to the august amendment to our revolving credit facility  which extended the term of the facility through august interest income interest income increased by approximately million  from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to additional interest earned in on the remaining proceeds from our september equity offering and net proceeds from the sale of our owned off campus property in december  which was invested in money market investments during the year

the increase in cash utilized in investing activities during the year ended december  is partly due to a million increase in cash used to fund the construction of our owned development properties

in addition  there was an million increase in the change of our construction accounts payable balance as a result of an increase in owned development activity financed with construction loans in as compared to comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital accounts provided approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
changes in working capital accounts provided million for the year ended december  while working capital accounts utilized million for the year ended december  these changes were primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization and operating cash flow generated from the acquisition of the royal portfolio on march   the acquisition of seven properties during the first quarter of  the opening of one owned off campus property in both august and august and an additional phase at an on campus participating property in august investing activities investing activities utilized million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash utilized in investing activities during the year ended december  related primarily to proceeds received from the sale of our owned off campus property  the village on university  in december and development costs incurred in on an additional phase of an on campus participating property that was completed and opened for occupancy in fall these decreases were offset by a million increase in cash used to fund the construction of our owned development properties and proceeds received from the sale of university village at san bernardino in january during the years ended december   three owned off campus properties were under development  of which one was completed and opened for occupancy in august during the year ended december   three owned off campus properties were under development  of which one was completed and opened for occupancy in august financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of our equity offering in september which raised million  net of offering costs  as compared to the million  net of offering costs  raised in our july equity offering 
in addition  during we paid down million  net of draws  on our revolving credit facility 
during we received million of construction loan proceeds  which were used to fund the construction of two of our owned development properties  as compared to million of construction loan proceeds received during to fund the development of an additional phase at an on campus participating property 
these increases were offset by the receipt of proceeds from a million bridge loan during and the million pay down of a construction loan with proceeds from our september equity offering 
in addition  there was a million increase in distributions to common and restricted stockholders during as a result of our july and september equity offerings 
structure of owned on campus properties we have entered into two year ground facility leases each with two ten year extensions available with a university system to finance  construct  and manage two student housing facilities  which are currently under construction with scheduled completion dates of august and august under the terms of these ground facility leases  the university system owns both the land and improvements  and we will make annual minimum rent payments to the university system during the first five years of operation for one property and the first ten years of operation for the other property 
in addition  we will pay the university system variable rent payments based upon the operating performance of the properties 
structure of on campus participating properties at our on campus participating properties  the subject universities own both the land and improvements 
we then have a leasehold interest under a ground facility lease 
under the lease  we receive an annual distribution representing of these properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses which includes our management fees  debt service which includes repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
we also manage these properties under multi year management agreements and are paid a management fee representing of receipts 
we do not have access to the cash flows and working capital of these participating properties except for the annual net cash distribution as described above 
additionally  a substantial portion of these properties cash flow is dedicated to capital reserves required under the applicable property indebtedness and to the amortization of such indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties since our interest  including our right to share in the net cash available for distribution from the properties  terminates upon the amortization of their indebtedness 
our economic interest in these properties is therefore limited to our interest in the net cash flow and management and development fees from these properties  as reflected in our calculation of funds from operations modified for the operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom contained herein 
accordingly  when considering these properties contribution to our operations  we focus upon our share of these properties net cash available for distribution and the management fees that we receive from these properties  rather than upon their contribution to our gross revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes 
the following table reflects the amounts related to our on campus participating properties included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and year ended december  revenues direct operating expenses amortization amortization of deferred financing costs ground facility lease net operating income interest income interest expense net income excludes property management fees of million for the year ended december  and million for both the years ended december  and this expense and the corresponding fee revenue recognized by us have been eliminated in consolidation 
also excludes allocation of expenses related to corporate management and oversight 
represents the universities share of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including payment of principal and capital expenditures 
interest expense is net of approximately million of capitalized interest for the year ended december  related to cullen oaks phase ii  an additional phase of the cullen oaks on campus participating property which was completed in august debt service expenditures for these properties totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances and liquidity as of december   excluding our on campus participating properties  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december  this decrease was primarily due to the use of the remaining proceeds from our september equity offering and december disposition of an owned off campus property  the village on university  to fund our property acquisitions and the construction of our owned development projects 
in october  we completed an equity offering which generated net proceeds of approximately we used million of the equity offering proceeds to pay off the balance on our revolving credit facility and million to pay off the university centre construction loan 
restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits  as required by law in certain states 
additionally  restricted cash as of december  also included million of funds held in escrow in connection with potential property acquisitions and development opportunities 
as of december   our short term liquidity needs included  but were not limited to  the following i anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately million based on an anticipated annual distribution of per share based on the number of our shares outstanding as of december   including those distributions required to maintain our reit status and satisfy our current distribution policy  ii anticipated distribution payments to our operating partnership unitholders totaling approximately million based on an anticipated annual distribution of per common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of on our series a preferred units based on the number of units outstanding as of december   iii funds for potential future acquisitions including approximately million used toward the purchase of two properties in february  iv remaining development costs on barrett honors college formerly component ii of the arizona state university project  estimated to be approximately million  and v funds for other potential future development projects 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and offerings under a shelf registration statement under which we may offer up to million of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and securities warrants 
we may seek additional funds to undertake the mergers and other initiatives or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
while we believe we will be able to obtain such funds  these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
equity offering on october   we completed an equity offering  consisting of the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million 
we received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting offering costs of approximately million 
we used million of these proceeds to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and million of the proceeds were used to pay off the construction loan for university centre  our recently completed owned off campus property 
vista del sol financing in december  we obtained a construction loan in the amount of million to fund a portion of the development and construction of vista del sol  an owned on campus property scheduled to open for occupancy in august we began making draws under the loan in september the loan has an initial term of months and for each borrowing we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  or three month libor plus 
the interest rate may be reduced to libor plus once construction of the property is complete and certain operations hurdles are met 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of december  the term of the loan can be extended through december through the exercise of two month extension periods 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
villas at chestnut ridge financing in june  we obtained a construction loan in the amount of million to fund a portion of the development and construction of villas at chestnut ridge  an owned off campus property scheduled to open for occupancy in august we began making draws under the loan in july the loan has an initial term of months and for each borrowing we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of june  the term of the loan can be extended through june through the exercise of a month extension period 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
revolving credit facility the operating partnership has a million revolving credit facility  which may be expanded by up to an additional million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
we anticipate increasing the size of the facility to million in the maturity date of the facility is august  and we guarantee the operating partnership s obligations under the facility 
availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to an aggregate borrowing base amount equal to the lesser of i of the value of certain properties  calculated as set forth in the credit facility  and ii the adjusted net operating income from these properties divided by a formula amount 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate  at the company s option  based upon a base rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus  in each case  a spread based upon the company s total leverage 
additionally  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the aggregate unused balance 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of  with remaining availability under the facility subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants totaling approximately million 
the terms of the facility include certain restrictions and covenants  which limit  among other items  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  and the disposition of assets 
the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain minimum ratios of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges 
we may not pay distributions that exceed of funds from operations  as adjusted  for any four consecutive quarters 
the financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we intend to make  but are not contractually bound to make  regular quarterly distributions to common stockholders and unit holders 
distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
we may be required to use borrowings under the credit facility  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our reit status 
the board of directors considers market factors and our company s performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels 
on january   we declared a fourth quarter distribution per share of which was paid on february   to all common stockholders of record as of february  at the same time  the operating partnership paid an equivalent amount per unit to holders of common units  as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of series a preferred units 
recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general capital expenditures and improvements 
our policy is to capitalize costs related to the acquisition  development  rehabilitation  construction  and improvement of properties  including interest and certain internal personnel costs related to the communities under rehabilitation and construction 
capital improvements are costs that increase the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
ordinary repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
recurring capital expenditures represent non incremental building improvements required to maintain current revenues and typically include appliances  carpeting and flooring  hvac equipment  kitchen bath cabinets  new roofs  site improvements and various exterior building improvements 
non recurring capital expenditures include expenditures that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a property which were considered necessary to bring the property up to operating standard  and incremental improvements that include  among other items community centers  new windows  and kitchen bath apartment upgrades 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute amounts to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at their mortgaged properties 
these annual contributions may exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred in such year at such properties 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our owned properties are set forth below as of and for the year ended december  average beds total recurring capital expenditures average per bed pre development expenditures our third party and owned development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
the closing and or commencement of construction of these development projects is subject to a number of risks such as our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms and delays or refusals in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  and other required governmental permits and authorizations as such  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained 
accordingly  we bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
historically  our third party and owned development projects have been successfully structured and financed  however  these developments have at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled  causing revenue to be recognized in later periods 
as of december   we have deferred approximately million in pre development costs related to third party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction 
indebtedness as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness excluding net unamortized debt premiums discounts of approximately million  comprised of a million balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility  million in mortgage and construction loans secured by of our wholly owned properties  million in mortgage loans secured by two phases of an on campus participating property  and million in bond issuances secured by three of our on campus participating properties 
the weighted average interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness as of december  was 
as of december   approximately of our total consolidated indebtedness was variable rate debt  comprised of our revolving credit facility and our vista del sol and villas at chestnut ridge construction loans discussed below 
wholly owned properties the weighted average interest rate of the million of wholly owned property mortgage and construction debt was as of december  each of the mortgage loans is a non recourse obligation subject to customary exceptions 
each of these mortgages has a year amortization  and none are cross defaulted or cross collateralized to any other indebtedness 
the loans generally may not be prepaid prior to maturity  in certain cases prepayment is allowed  subject to prepayment penalties 
in connection with our october equity offering  we paid off the entire million balance of the construction loan for university centre  an owned off campus property which completed construction and opened for occupancy in august the development and construction of vista del sol  an owned on campus property scheduled to complete construction and open for occupancy in august  is partially financed with a million construction loan 
for each borrowing we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  or three month libor plus 
the interest rate may be reduced to libor plus once construction of the property is complete and certain operations hurdles are met 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of december  the term of the loan can be extended through december through the exercise of two month extension periods 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
the development and construction of villas at chestnut ridge  an owned off campus property scheduled to complete construction and open for occupancy in august  is partially financed with a million construction loan 
for each borrowing we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of june  the term of the loan can be extended through june through the exercise of a month extension period 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
on campus participating properties three of our on campus participating properties are financed with million of outstanding project based taxable bonds 
under the terms of these financings  one of our special purpose subsidiaries publicly issued three series of taxable bonds and loaned the proceeds to three special purpose subsidiaries that each hold a separate leasehold interest 
although a default in payment by these special purpose subsidiaries could result in a default under one or more series of bonds  the indebtedness of any of these special purpose subsidiaries is not cross defaulted or cross collateralized with indebtedness of the company  the operating partnership or other special purpose subsidiaries 
repayment of principal and interest on these bonds is insured by mbia  inc the loans encumbering the leasehold interests are non recourse  subject to customary exceptions 
cullen oaks phase i and phase ii loans are currently encumbered by mortgage loans with balances as of december  of approximately million and million  respectively 
in february  we extended the maturity date of these loans to february the loans bear interest at a rate of libor plus and require payments of interest only through may and monthly payments of principal and interest from may through the maturity date 
in connection with these loan extensions  we terminated the existing interest rate swap agreement on the cullen oaks phase i loan and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement effective february  through february   that is designated to hedge our exposure to fluctuations on interest payments attributed to changes in interest rates associated with payments on the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii loans 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate of libor plus 
pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estate does not achieve financial break even defined as revenues less operating expenses  excluding management fees  less debt service  the applicable lessor would be required to make a rental payment  also known as the contingent payment  sufficient to achieve financial break even 
the contingent payment provision remains in effect until such time as any financing placed on the facilities would receive an investment grade rating without the contingent payment provision 
in the event that the lessor is required to make a contingent payment  future net cash flow distributions would be first applied to repay such contingent payments and then to unpaid management fees prior to normal distributions 
we have guaranteed payment of this property s indebtedness 
the weighted average interest rate of the indebtedness encumbering our on campus participating properties was at december  off balance sheet items we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter long term debt operating leases capital leases owned development project long term debt obligations reflect the payment of both principal and interest 
for long term obligations with a variable interest rate  the rate in effect at december  was assumed to remain constant over all periods presented 
includes minimum annual lease payments under the ground facility leases for university village at tu  university centre formerly village at newark  vista del sol and barrett honors college 
consists of the completion costs related to barrett honors college  which will be funded entirely by us through our ace program and is scheduled to be completed in august we have entered into a contract with a general contractor for certain phases of the construction of this project 
however  this contract does not generally cover all of the costs that are necessary to place the property into service  including the cost of furniture and marketing and leasing costs 
the unfunded commitments presented include all such costs  not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under the construction contract 
funds from operations as defined by nareit  ffo represents income loss before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net loss income year ended december  net loss income minority interests gain from disposition of real estate loss from unconsolidated joint venture ffo from unconsolidated joint venture real estate related depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization corporate furniture  fixtures  and equipment depreciation funds from operations ffo ffo per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted represents an unconsolidated joint venture which closed in december our share of the ffo from this unconsolidated joint venture is included for purposes of calculating ffo but is excluded for purposes of calculating ffom  as management believes this amount does not accurately reflect our participation in the economics of the transaction 
for the year ended december   our share of the venture s ffo equals our share of the net loss  as there was no depreciation expense incurred during the period 
during the year ended december   we recorded a compensation charge and related tax impact of approximately million  or per fully diluted share  related to the outperformance bonus plan 
excluding this compensation charge and related tax impact  ffo for the year ended december  would have been million  or per fully diluted share 
for a detailed discussion of the outperformance bonus plan  refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
while our on campus participating properties contributed million  million and million to our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  under our participating ground leases  we and the participating university systems each receive of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness 
as noted above  ffo excludes gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets because these gaap items assume that the value of real estate diminishes over time 
however  unlike the ownership of our owned off campus properties  the unique features of our ownership interest in our on campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time 
for example  since the ground facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt  such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor 
accordingly  when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to modify ffo to exclude the operations of our on campus participating properties and to consider their impact on performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive  both of which increase and decrease with the operating measure of the properties  a measure referred to herein as ffom 
funds from operations modified for operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom year ended december  funds from operations elimination of operations of on campus participating properties and unconsolidated joint venture net income from on campus participating properties amortization of investment in on campus participating properties ffo from unconsolidated joint venture modifications to reflect operational performance of on campus participating properties our share of net cash flow management fees on campus participating properties development fees impact of on campus participating properties funds from operations modified for operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom ffom per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted represents an unconsolidated joint venture which closed in december our share of the ffo from this unconsolidated joint venture is included for purposes of calculating ffo but is excluded for purposes of calculating ffom  as management believes this amount does not accurately reflect our participation in the economics of the transaction 
for the year ended december   our share of the venture s ffo equals our share of the net loss  as there was no depreciation expense incurred during the period 
of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
amounts represent actual cash received for the year to date periods and amounts accrued for the interim periods 
as a result of using accrual based results in interim periods and cash based results for year to date periods  the sum of reported interim results may not agree to annual cash received 
development and construction management fees  including construction savings earned under the general construction contract  related to the cullen oaks phase ii on campus participating property  which was completed in august during the year ended december   we recorded a compensation charge and related tax impact of approximately million  or per fully diluted share  related to the outperformance bonus plan 
excluding this compensation charge and related tax impact  ffom for the year ended december  would have been million  or per fully diluted share 
for a detailed discussion of the outperformance bonus plan  refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
this narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization 
we believe  however  that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long term profitability from its investment 
our ffom may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the unique contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on campus participating properties  which is different from that of our off campus owned properties 
additionally  ffom reflects features of our ownership interests in our on campus participating properties that are unique to us 
companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures  and therefore those companies may not calculate a ffom in the same manner that we do  or at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap and ffo results and using our modified ffo only supplementally 
inflation our leases do not typically provide for rent escalations 
however  they typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance acquisitions  developments and maturing debt 
these borrowings expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  and we had fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates basis points would cause a million and million decline in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would cause a million and million increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
due to the structure of our floating rate debt and interest rate protection instruments  the impact of a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on our net income to common stockholders and cash flows would not be significant at december  or all of our outstanding indebtedness is fixed rate except for our revolving credit facility and our vista del sol and villas at chestnut ridge construction loans 
our revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  in each case  a spread based on our total leverage 
the vista del sol construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
the villas at chestnut ridge construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
we have in place an interest rate swap agreement  designated as a cash flow hedge  which effectively fixes the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii mortgage loans at through maturity in we anticipate incurring additional variable rate indebtedness in the future  including draws under our million revolving credit facility 
we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
