item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading producer of factory built housing in the united states and western canada 
as of december   we operated homebuilding facilities in states in the us and five facilities in three provinces in western canada 
as of december   our homes were sold through more than  independent sales centers  builders  and developers across the us and western canada 
approximately of our independent retailer locations were members of our champion home centers chc retail distribution network 
as of december   our homes were also sold through company owned sales offices in california 
we are also a leading modular builder in the united kingdom  where we operate four manufacturing facilities and construct steel framed modular buildings for use as prisons  military accommodations  hotels and residential units 
on december   we acquired substantially all the assets and the business of sri homes  inc  sri a leading producer of factory built homes in western canada  for cash payments of approximately million  a note payable of million and assumption of the operating liabilities of the business 
sri operates three manufacturing plants with one each in the provinces of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan 
this acquisition expanded our presence in one of the strongest housing markets in north america 
sri is included in our manufacturing segment  but due to the timing of the acquisition  had no impact on our consolidated results 
on april   we acquired of the capital stock of united kingdom based calsafe group holdings limited and its operating subsidiary caledonian building systems limited caledonian  for approximately million in cash  plus potential contingent purchase price up to approximately million and additional potential contingent consideration to be paid over four years 
our international manufacturing segment the international segment currently consists of caledonian and its four manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom 
on july   we acquired certain of the assets and the business of north american housing corp 
and an affiliate north american for approximately million in cash plus assumption of certain operating liabilities 
north american is a modular homebuilder that operates two manufacturing facilities in virginia 
on march   we acquired of the membership interests of highland manufacturing company  llc highland  a manufacturer of modular and hud code homes that operates one plant in minnesota  for cash consideration of approximately million 
north american and highland are included in our manufacturing segment 
north american  highland and caledonian are referred to as the acquisitions and their results are included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates 
deteriorating hud code industry conditions have negatively affected our u 
s operations during the past several years as a result of relatively tight availability of consumer financing and lower levels of demand 
during the past two years the market for factory built homes has also been affected by adverse conditions in the overall us housing market and the us economy 
excluding homes sold to fema in and  annual industry shipments of hud code homes averaged  homes during the last five years as compared to  homes in industry shipments of hud code homes totaled approximately  in  which was the lowest industry volume since these conditions led to weak incoming order rates for hud code and modular homes at our us plants in and most of our us plants operated on one week or less of unfilled orders throughout the year resulting in production inefficiencies and increased production downtime 
as a result of these conditions  in we closed three manufacturing plants and temporarily idled another plant in the us and in we closed four plants in the us our acquisitions in and were part of our strategy to diversify our revenue base with a focus on increasing our modular homebuilding presence in the us and to seek factory built construction opportunities outside of the us our pretax income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million versus million in compared to  our manufacturing segment income declined million or nearly on a decline in sales despite significantly better results from our canadian operations and the 
table of contents inclusion of full year results for highland and north american 
most of the decreased profitability in the manufacturing segment occurred in the first and fourth quarters of meanwhile  during our manufacturing segment s canadian operations enjoyed strong sales volumes  relatively high levels of unfilled orders and increased pricing power resulting in increased profitability 
homes sold in by our canadian operations increased over the number sold in total homes we sold in canada in  including homes produced in the us  increased over the number we sold in our international segment in the uk also experienced growth in with strong backlogs  high utilization of manufacturing capacity and a significant increase in site work revenues 
international segment sales and income for the full year increased more than over results in  which consisted of only nine months 
our retail segment  which operates exclusively in california  suffered from poor housing market conditions in that state and showed significant decreases in both sales and segment income in included in income from continuing operations for the year ended december   were charges totaling million related to the closure of two plants in the manufacturing segment  a loss on debt retirement of million and a compensation charge of million in the international segment as a result of a contingent purchase price or earn out arrangement related to the acquisition of caledonian 
included in income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were gains of million  primarily from the sale of an investment property in florida and five idle manufacturing plants  a fixed asset impairment charge of million for the closure of a manufacturing plant and a million reduction to our closed plant warranty accrual 
effective july   we reversed substantially all of the previously recorded valuation allowance for of deferred tax assets after determining that realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in recording a million non cash income tax benefit in the second quarter of subsequent to this reversal  our earnings are fully taxed for financial reporting purposes 
during the year ended december   we completed the disposal of our traditional retail operations through the sale of our remaining traditional retail sales centers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of sfas no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations  the traditional retail sales centers closed or sold in and  along with their related administrative offices  are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
continuing retail operations in  and consist of our ongoing non traditional california retail operations 
during the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we sold homes and  homes  respectively  to the federal emergency management agency fema in connection with its hurricane relief efforts  resulting in revenues of million and million  respectively 
on february   our manufacturing facility in henry  tn was destroyed by fire 
we immediately established a plan to service the plant s retail customers while we evaluate the situation 
the net book value of plant  equipment and inventory of the henry plant at february  was approximately million 
we are fully insured through our property insurance coverage  subject to a  deductible 
we continue to focus on matching our factory built housing manufacturing capacity to industry and local market conditions and improving or eliminating under performing manufacturing facilities 
since june  we have closed eight homebuilding plants in the us we continually review our manufacturing capacity and will make further adjustments as deemed necessary

income taxes income taxes versus analysis the effective tax rate for was and was impacted by the mix of our pretax earnings among jurisdictions and the respective tax rates in those jurisdictions 
as a result  the tax benefit from our us loss exceeded the tax expense on foreign income 
also impacting the effective tax rate is the effect of permanent differences and state tax benefits 
due to the low level of consolidated pretax income  these factors had a significant impact on the effective tax rate 
effective july   we reversed substantially all of the previously recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets after determining that realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
this determination was based upon our achieving historical profitability and our outlook for ongoing profitability  among other factors 
subsequent to this reversal our earnings are fully taxed for financial reporting purposes 
during the periods prior to this reversal of the valuation allowance  no tax expense or benefit was recorded for our us taxable income or loss for financial reporting purposes except for unusual items 
the income tax provision includes a million non cash tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance 
the reversal was originally reported as million but was subsequently reduced  effective july   by million primarily to eliminate the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock option tax deductions  the benefit of which  when realized  will result in an increase to shareholders equity

contingent repurchase obligations manufacturing segment we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
upon default by a retailer under a floor plan financing agreement subject to an associated repurchase agreement  the manufacturer is generally required to repurchase the loan or the home for the unpaid balance of the floor plan loan  subject to certain adjustments 
in the event of such repurchases  our loss represents the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net proceeds we realize from the resale of the home  less any related reserves or accrued volume rebates that will not be paid 
each quarter we review our contingent wholesale repurchase obligations to assess the adequacy of our reserves for repurchase losses 
this analysis is based on a review of current and historical experience  reports received from 
table of contents the primary national floor plan lenders that provide floor plan financing for approximately of our manufacturing sales  and information regarding the performance of our retailers obtained from our manufacturing facilities 
we do not retain repurchase risk for cash sales and we do not always enter into repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders that provide financing for the balance of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers 
the estimated repurchase obligation is calculated as the total amount that would be paid upon the default of all of our independent retailers whose inventories are subject to repurchase agreements  without reduction for the resale value of the repurchased homes 
as of december   our largest independent retailer  a nationwide retailer  had approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for up to months from date of invoice 
as of december  our next largest independent retailers had an aggregate of approximately million of inventory subject to repurchase for generally up to months from date of invoice  with individual amounts ranging from approximately million to million per retailer

the conversion rate can exceed shares per  of principal when the closing price of our common stock exceeds approximately per share for one or more days in the consecutive trading day period beginning on the second trading day after the conversion date 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we are involved in certain types of corporate transactions or other events constituting a fundamental change 
holders of the convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on november of    and we have the right to redeem the convertible notes  in whole or in part  for cash at any time after october  
table of contents on october   we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with various financial institutions  which has been amended from time to time the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is comprised of a million term loan the term loan  a million term loan denominated in pounds sterling the sterling term loan  a revolving line of credit in the amount of million and a million letter of credit facility 
as of december   letters of credit issued under the facility totaled million and there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement also provides us with the right from time to time to borrow incremental uncommitted term loans of up to an additional million  which may be denominated in us dollars or pounds sterling 
the credit agreement is secured by a first security interest in substantially all of the assets of our domestic operating subsidiaries 
the credit agreement requires principal payments for the term loan and the sterling term loan totaling approximately million for and approximately million annually thereafter 
the interest rate for borrowings under the term loan is currently a libor based rate plus and the interest rate for borrowings under the sterling term loan is currently a uk libor based rate plus 
letter of credit fees are annually and revolver borrowings bear interest at either the prime interest rate plus or libor plus 
in addition  there is a fee on the unused portion of the facility ranging from to annually 
the maturity date for each of the term loan  the sterling term loan and the letter of credit facility is october   and the maturity date for the revolving line of credit is october  the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants 
under the credit agreement  we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of total debt as defined on the last day of a fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda as defined for the four quarter period then ended 
we are also required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to cash interest expense as defined over the four quarter period then ended and a minimum fixed charge ratio of consolidated ebitda to fixed charges as defined over the four quarter period then ended 
annual prepayments are required should we generate excess cash flow as defined 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with all covenants throughout the senior notes due are secured equally and ratably with our obligations under the credit agreement 
interest is payable semi annually at an annual rate of 
in november  the indenture governing the senior notes was modified via a supplemental indenture  which eliminated substantially all restrictive covenants 
we continuously evaluate our capital structure in light of existing and expected market conditions 
strategies considered to improve our capital structure include without limitation  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging  or otherwise retiring our outstanding indebtedness  restructuring of obligations  new financings  and issuances of securities  whether in the open market or by other means and to the extent permitted by our existing financing arrangements 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
we expect to spend less than million in on capital expenditures 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near term 
we may use a portion of our cash balances and or incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions of businesses 
contingent liabilities and obligations we had significant contingent liabilities and obligations at december   including surety bonds and letters of credit totaling million and guarantees of million of debt of unconsolidated affiliates 
additionally  we are contingently obligated under repurchase agreements with certain lending institutions that provide floor plan financing to our independent retailers 
we estimate our contingent repurchase obligation as of december  was approximately million  without reduction for the resale value of the homes 
see contingent repurchase obligations manufacturing segment discussed above in item of this report 

table of contents we have provided various representations  warranties and other standard indemnifications in the ordinary course of our business  in agreements to acquire and sell business assets and in financing arrangements 
we are also subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
management believes the ultimate liability with respect to these contingent liabilities and obligations will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
summary of liquidity and capital resources at december   our unrestricted cash balances totaled million and we had unused availability of million under our revolving credit facility 
therefore  total cash available from these sources was approximately million 
we expect that our cash flow from operations and our cash balances will be adequate to fund capital expenditures as well as the approximate million of scheduled debt payments due in and  including the million note payable for the sri acquisition  the million caledonian earn out obligation and the remaining million of senior notes due therefore  the level of cash availability is projected to be in excess of cash needed to operate our businesses for the next two years 
we may use a portion of our cash balances and or incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions of businesses 
in the event that our operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of our capital resources were to become unavailable  we would revise our operating strategies accordingly 
contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of payments due by period for our contractual obligations for long term debt  capital leases  operating leases  and certain other long term liabilities as of december  payments due by period after december  total years in thousands long term debt convertible notes due senior notes due term loans due obligations under industrial revenue bonds note payable  sri acquisition caledonian earnout obligation capital leases and other debt operating leases total based on the repurchase and redemption features  which first become available in  the convertible notes are listed as being due in in the table above 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
assumptions and estimates of future earnings and cash flow are used in the periodic analyses of the recoverability of goodwill  intangible assets  deferred tax assets and property  plant and equipment 
historical 
table of contents experience and trends are used to estimate reserves  including reserves for self insured risks  warranty costs and wholesale repurchase losses 
following is a description of each accounting policy requiring significant judgments and estimates reserves for self insured risks we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  general and products liability  auto liability  health and property insurance 
under our current self insurance programs  we are generally responsible for up to million per claim for workers compensation million per claim in california and automobile liability claims  up to million  million or million per claim for product liability and general liability claims  depending on the policy year under which the claim is made  and up to  per claim for property insurance claims including business interruption losses 
we maintain excess liability and property insurance with independent insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
under our current self insurance program we are responsible for up to  of health insurance claims per contract per year 
estimated casualty and health insurance costs are accrued for incurred claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors considered in estimating our insurance reserves are the nature of outstanding claims including the severity of the claims  estimated costs to settle existing claims  loss history and inflation  as well as estimates provided by our third party actuaries 
significant changes in the factors described above could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
warranty reserves our manufacturing operations generally provide the retail homebuyer or the builder developer with a twelve month warranty 
estimated warranty costs are accrued as cost of sales at the time of sale 
our warranty reserve is based on estimates of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on homes sold by the manufacturing operations as of the balance sheet date 
factors used to calculate the warranty obligation are the estimated number of homes still under warranty  including homes in retailer inventories and homes purchased by consumers still within the twelve month warranty period and the historical average costs incurred to service a home 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
property  plant and equipment the recoverability of property  plant and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  primarily based on estimated selling prices  appraised values or projected undiscounted cash flows 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy and operating conditions 
additionally  we use estimates of fair market values to establish impairment reserves for permanently closed facilities that are held for sale 
past evaluations of property  plant and equipment have resulted in significant impairment charges primarily for closed manufacturing facilities and retail sales centers 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the requirements established in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recording of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
effective july   we reversed substantially all of the previously recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets after determining that realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
this determination was based upon achieving historical profitability and our outlook for ongoing profitability  among other factors 
projections of future profitability and levels of taxable income are required in assessing deferred tax assets and involve significant estimates and assumptions 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the need to establish a valuation allowance for all or part of our deferred tax assets again in the future 

table of contents although we expect to generate sufficient us pretax income in the future to utilize available nol carryforwards there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
additionally  the current us economy and housing market present significant challenges to returning our us operations to profitability 
in the event that we incur additional us operating losses in  we will likely be required to provide a valuation allowance for all or a portion of the us net deferred tax assets which totaled million at december  goodwill and amortizable intangible assets goodwill and amortizable intangible assets are related to both our manufacturing and international segments 
we test for impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test for impairment of amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the fair value of our manufacturing and international segments versus their carrying value as of each fiscal year end or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
when estimating the segment s fair value  we calculate the present value of future cash flows based on forecasted sales volumes and profit margins  the number of manufacturing facilities in operation  current industry and economic conditions  historical results and inflation 
we also use available market value information to evaluate fair value 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the segments and the recoverability of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets or differences between estimates and actual results could result in impairment charges in the future 
wholesale repurchase reserves approximately of our manufacturing sales to independent retailers are made pursuant to repurchase agreements with the providers of floor plan financing 
we determine our repurchase reserves based on the greater of the fair value of the guaranty made under the repurchase agreements and an estimate of losses for homes expected to be repurchased based on historical repurchase experience 
an additional reserve is established for estimated losses related to specific retailer defaults that are deemed to be probable 
losses under repurchase obligations are determined by calculating the difference between the repurchase price and the estimated net resale value of the homes  less accrued rebates which will not be paid 
estimated losses under repurchase agreements are based on the historical number of homes repurchased  the cost of such repurchases and the historical losses incurred  as well as the current inventory levels held at our independent retailers 
in addition  we monitor the risks associated with our independent retailers and consider these risks in identifying probable retailer defaults 
significant changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
revenue recognition the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition is used for certain construction contracts 
this method of accounting requires estimates and assumptions as to total costs and profitability for each contract 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates resulting in significant adjustments to reported income 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on our operations during the last three years 
commodity prices  including lumber  fluctuate  however  during periods of rising commodity prices we have generally been able to pass the increased costs to our customers in the form of surcharges and price increases 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard number sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early 
table of contents adoption permitted 
in february  the fasb issued fsp fas that delayed  by one year  the effective date of sfas for the majority of non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
however  we would still be required to adopt sfas as of january  for certain assets and liabilities which were not included in fsp fas we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of sfas will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation number fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies accounting for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold for tax positions 
under fin  we will initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the tax position  that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
if the tax benefit meets the more likely than not threshold  the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our best estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority 
the adoption of fin required no adjustment to opening balance sheet accounts as of december  in february  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard number sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to provide entities with an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
entities that choose to measure eligible items at fair value will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be elected at specified election dates on an instrument by instrument basis  with few exceptions 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standard number r sfas r  business combinations and financial accounting standard number sfas  accounting and reporting of non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas r and sfas expand the scope of acquisition accounting to all transactions and circumstances under which control of a business is obtained 
sfas r and sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption prohibited and these standards must be adopted concurrently 
these standards will impact us for any acquisitions subsequent to the adoption date  however  we have not yet determined the effect that the implementation of sfas r and sfas will have on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt obligations under the credit agreement are currently subject to variable rates of interest based on both us and uk libor 
a basis point increase in the underlying interest rate would result in an additional annual interest cost of approximately million  assuming average related debt of million  which was the amount of related outstanding borrowings at december  our obligations under industrial revenue bonds are subject to variable rates of interest based on short term tax exempt rate indices 
a basis point increase in the underlying interest rates would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately  assuming average related debt of million  which was the amount of outstanding borrowings at december  our approach to interest rate risk is to balance our borrowings between fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at december   we had million of convertible notes and million of senior notes at fixed rates and million of term notes and industrial revenue bonds at variable rates 
at december   we had 
table of contents million of senior notes at a fixed rate and million of term notes and industrial revenue bonds at variable rates 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk with our factory built housing operations in canada and our international segment in the uk 
our canadian operations had proforma net sales totaling million cad  including sri s net sales 
assuming future annual canadian sales equal to proforma sales  a change of in exchange rates between the us and canadian dollars would change consolidated sales by million 
our international segment had sales of million pounds sterling 
assuming future annual uk sales equal to sales  a change of in exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling would change consolidated sales by million 
net income of the canadian and uk operations would also be affected by changes in exchange rates 
we borrowed million in the us to finance a portion of the caledonian purchase price  which totaled approximately million 
this sterling denominated borrowing was designated as an economic hedge of our net investment in the uk 
therefore a significant portion of foreign exchange risk related to our caledonian investment in the uk is offset 
we do not hedge our investment in the canadian operations
