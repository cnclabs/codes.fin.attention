item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a real estate investment trust  which we refer to as a reit  engaged in the business of owning real property and real estate related assets 
with certain self imposed limitations  we will seek opportunities to invest in or acquire most types of real estate assets or securities 
we operate in three strategic business segments i ownership of operating properties  which we refer to as operating properties  ii origination and acquisition of loans and debt securities secured directly or indirectly by commercial and multi family real property  including collateral mortgage backed securities and collateral debt obligation securities  which we refer to as loan assets and loan securities  and iii ownership of equity interests in other reits  which we refer to as reit equity interests 
we acquire assets through direct ownership as well as through entering into specific strategic alliances and ventures 
in particular  we have entered into two significant venture arrangements 
our venture with marc realty llc  which we refer to as marc realty  a chicago area real estate company  is our primary vehicle for investments in the chicago metropolitan area 
in addition  since its formation in march  we acquire substantially all of our loan assets and loan securities through concord debt holdings llc  which we refer to as concord  a venture with lexington realty trust  which we refer to as lexington 
the formation of concord enables us to increase and diversify our loan asset and loan security portfolio as it effectively doubles the capital available for investments in loan assets and loan securities 
as opportunities present themselves  we will continue to seek to enter into venture arrangements with regional or specialized real estate professionals with extensive experience in a particular market or asset type as well as seeking to enter into strategic co investment ventures managed by us with institutional and high net worth investors to enhance our total return through acquisition  asset management and other fees and a promoted economic interest 
in view of the foregoing  our near term investment strategy will be to identify and invest in discrete real estate investments including investments through ventures 
as market conditions dictate  we will focus our investment activity in one or more of our business segments and aggressively pursue such opportunities 
we intend to fund these investments through one or more of the following cash  borrowings under our credit facility  property loans  issuance of debt and equity  and ventures with third parties 
for the long term  as investments mature in value to the point where we are unlikely to achieve better than a market return on their then enhanced value  it is likely we will exit the investment and seek to redeploy the capital to higher yielding opportunities 
therefore  the sale of these investments are an important part of our overall earnings and may result in uneven earnings that may vary greatly from quarter to quarter 
our business objective is to maximize long term shareholder value through a total return value approach to real estate investing 
we measure our success in meeting this objective by a number of factors  including increases in diluted per share net income  cash returns generated by our investments  increases in shareholder equity and total return to our shareholders 
during  and  our operating results were as follow net income applicable to common shares net income per common share  basic net income per common share  diluted net cash provided by operating activities total assets total shareholders equity trends competition we face substantial competition for our targeted investments 
our ability to grow our investment portfolio depends to a significant degree on our ability to implement our investment policy and operating strategies 
we compete with numerous other companies for investments  including other reits  insurance companies  real estate opportunity funds  pension funds and a multitude of private investors 
many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and for this and other reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully for particular investments 
we will continue to capitalize on the acquisition and investment opportunities that our advisor brings to us as a result of its acquisition experience as well as our partners in ventures which serve as platforms to investments in various geographic areas and particular classes of assets 
through its broad experience  our advisor s senior management team has established a network of contacts and relationships  including relationships with operators  financiers  commercial real estate brokers  potential tenants and other key industry participants 
interest rate environment both our loan assets and our loan obligations are customarily based on floating rate indexes  such as libor or us treasuries  which can fluctuate 
with respect to our loan assets  we seek to eliminate this risk by obtaining match financing 
that is  we finance a portion of our loan asset acquisitions through financings under which our interest payment obligations are tied to the same index as the loan asset 
in this way  we assure that the spread between the interest rate on the loan asset and the interest rate on the loan obligation remains constant 
with respect to our loan obligations secured by our operating properties  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  options  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the potential negative effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our operations 
in the past  we entered into the following agreements in order to limit our exposure to interest rate volatility i an interest rate swap with a  notional amount  that was subsequently negotiated to a notional amount of  that expires december  and effectively converted the interest rate on that portion of principal of our note payable to keybank  with an outstanding balance at december  of  secured by certain of our net lease properties  from a floating rate equal to libor plus to a fixed libor rate of plus and ii an interest rate swap with a balance guaranty on our repurchase agreement with respect to our first mortgage residential whole pool loan certificates  which bears interest at libor minus  effectively fixing our rate at on that financing 
we do not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative purposes but only for interest rate risk management 
liquidity and capital resources general liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments and other general business needs 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility and issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required for our investment activities 
additionally  to maintain our status as a reit  we must pay dividends annually in an amount equal to at least of our reit taxable income 
as a result of this dividend requirement  we  like other reits  are dependent on raising capital through equity and debt issuances to obtain funds with which to expand our business 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from our operating properties  payments received from our loan assets and loan securities  dividends received from our ownership of reit equity interests  distributions from ventures  borrowings under our credit facility  and equity and debt issuances 
we had cash and cash equivalents of  at december   which consisted of  in cash and  in cash equivalents with maturities of less than days 
in addition  we had  available under our credit facility 
as noted above  we expect to raise additional funds through debt financing and or equity offerings 
toward that end  during we raised approximately  from issuances of our common shares in registered offerings and in january we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s to enable us to sell  of our common shares pursuant to a rights offering to our existing holders of our common shares and our series b preferred shares 
further  pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  which we refer to as our drip  which was instituted in we issued a total of  common shares resulting in gross proceeds of  in at december   we had an effective registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of approximately  of additional equity or debt securities 
in addition  our upreit structure will also enable us to acquire properties by issuing to sellers  as a form of consideration  limited partnership interests in our operating partnership 
although to date we have not issued limited partnership interests in a transaction  we believe that this structure will facilitate our ability to acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties by enabling us to structure transactions which will defer taxes payable by a seller while preserving our available cash for other purposes  including the possible payment of dividends 
future cash requirements the following table sets forth the timing of our payment obligations related to our off balance sheet and contractual obligations  including all fixed and variable rate debt obligations  except as otherwise noted  as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years mortgage loans payable principal and interest revolving line of credit principal and interest repurchase agreements ground lease obligations advisors fee off balance sheet obligations commitments concord the underlying lease agreements require the tenant to pay the ground rent expense 
base management fee based upon the terms of the advisory agreement and equity and assets in place at december   with no effect given to the additional investments or equity issuances after december  or to incentive fee compensation to fur advisors 
no amounts have been included for subsequent renewal periods of the advisory agreement 
excludes pending acquisitions that are subject to due diligence 
we carry comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance i fire  ii flood  iii extended coverage  iv acts of terrorism  as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of  and v rental loss insurance with respect to our operating properties where coverage is not provided by our net lease tenants 
under the terms of our net leases  the tenant is obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by our operating properties which are generally non recourse to us contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance 
although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements  we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain at reasonable costs  it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio 
cash flows our level of liquidity based upon cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease resulted from  of cash used in financing activities  which was partially offset by  of cash provided by our operating activities and  of cash provided by our investing activities 
cash provided by operating activities of  was comprised of i net income of  ii net positive adjustments for non cash items of  and iii a net negative change in operating assets and liabilities of  the adjustments for non cash items were comprised of increases due to i non cash other than temporary impairment loss on our reit equity interests of  ii depreciation and amortization of  iii minority interest expense of  iv provision for loss on loan receivable of  v loss on early extinguishment of debt of  vi a decrease in interest receivable on loans of  and vii bad debt expense of  the decreases in non cash items were due to i net gains on sale of securities available for sale of  ii the effect of straight lining of rental income of  iii equity in earnings of equity investments in excess of distributions of  iv interest earned on restricted cash of  and v earnings of preferred equity investments in excess of distributions of  see results of operations below for additional details on our operations 
cash provided by investing activities consisted of  of collections of loan receivables   of proceeds received from repayment on our whole pool mortgage backed securities available for sale   of proceeds from the sale of real estate securities   of proceeds from preferred equity investments   of return of capital distributions on our equity investments  return of capital distribution from available for sale securities of  and  of cash received upon foreclosure of property 
we used cash for investing activities in as follows i  for investment in our concord venture and  for investment in our other equity investments  ii  for investment in our preferred equity investment  iii  for operating property acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing operating properties  iv  to issue new loans receivable  v  to purchase available for sale securities  and vi  to increase restricted cash held in escrow 
we used cash for financing activities in as follows i  for dividend payments on our common shares  ii  for repayment of borrowings under repurchase agreements  iii  for mortgage loan repayments  iv  for distributions to minority interests  v  for payment of deferred loan costs  and vi  for repayment of loans 
cash provided by financing activities in was the result of  of mortgage loan proceeds   of proceeds from our drip   of contributions from minority partners and  decrease in restricted cash held in escrow 
results of operations as discussed earlier  one of the factors used to measure management s performance is net operating income 
we define net operating income for each segment presented as the segment s revenue and other income less operating expenses 
we have determined that we have three reportable operating segments operating properties  loan assets and loan securities and reit equity interests 
the reportable segments were determined based on our method of internal reporting 
the operating properties segment includes all of our wholly and partially owned operating properties 
the loan assets and loan securities segment includes all of our activities related to senior and mezzanine real estate loans 
the reit equity interests segment includes all of our activities related to the ownership of securities in other publicly traded real estate companies 
in addition to our three business segments  we report our non segment specific income and expenses under corporate activities
