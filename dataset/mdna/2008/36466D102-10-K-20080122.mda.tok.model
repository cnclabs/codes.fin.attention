item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this report  including those set forth under item a  risk factors 
overview we design  develop  and market interactive electronic player terminals  bingo systems  server based wireless gaming systems  and video lottery terminals 
we entered the vlt business in march with our acquisition of summit gaming for million in cash 
for our three most recent fiscal years ended october    and  our portable bingo terminals  fixed base bingo terminals  and vlt businesses made the following contributions to revenue revenue contribution portable bingo terminals fixed base bing terminals video lottery terminals as of october   we had bingo systems in service in states  one us territory and in four foreign countries  and we had sales of vlts and related software and equipment in states and one us territory 
our bingo business generates revenue by placing electronic bingo systems in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue growth is affected by player acceptance of electronic bingo as an addition or an alternative to paper bingo  our ability to expand operations into new markets and our ability to increase our market share 
fixed base bingo terminals generate greater revenue per terminal than portable bingo terminals  but also require a greater initial capital investment 
we typically install our electronic bingo systems at no charge to our customers  and we capitalize the costs 
for fiscal year and fiscal year  costs of  and  were capitalized  respectively  and are amortized over the expected term of the contract 
we record depreciation of bingo equipment over either a three or five year estimated useful life using the straight line method of depreciation 
our vlt business generates revenue from the sale of video lottery terminals new and used  software conversion kits  content fees  license fees  participation fees  parts equipment and services 
over of summit gaming s sales are derived from the sale of new and used equipment  conversion kits  and parts equipment 
in some instances we may choose to sell new equipment on a participation basis thereby recognizing recurring participation revenue in lieu of a one time machine sale 
revenue growth is driven by increasing market share in existing markets and expanding product placement into new vlt markets 
our bingo and vlt expenses consist primarily of a cost of revenue  consisting of expenses associated with technical and operational support of the bingo systems within bingo halls  depreciation and amortization of bingo terminals  cost of sales related to summit gaming equipment sold  the repair refurbishment disposals of bingo terminals and related support equipment  and excess or obsolescence allowance  b general and administrative  consisting of activities associated with management of our company and related support  which includes finance and accounting  legal  compliance  information systems  human resources  and accounts receivable reserve  c sales and marketing  consisting primarily of commissions paid to distributors for promoting and supporting our products and an internal sales force with a focus upon generating new customers and upgrades for existing customers  and d research and development  consisting of company sponsored research and development activities to provide players with new or enhanced products on which to play electronic bingo or new games themes for our video lottery terminals

transactions resulting in stock compensation expense in december  the vesting period for  employee stock options to purchase shares of our common stock was accelerated and became fully vested 
as a result of this stock option modification  we recorded compensation expense of  for the quarter ended january  the stock compensation expense was calculated using the intrinsic value method  which compares the common stock option exercise price to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of modification 
the stock compensation expense is recorded in the general and administrative section of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in january  the term for  options of a former employee to purchase shares of our common stock was extended for an additional six months and vesting was accelerated as the result of a consulting agreement 
as a result  we recorded compensation expense of  for the quarter ended january  the stock options are subject to measurement under financial accounting standards fas and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf 
fas set forth the requirements with respect to accounting for transactions involving a company s stock that is issued in exchange for goods or services 
according to fas  these transactions should be measured at the fair value of the equity issued 
in accordance with eitf  compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the option at the date the performance commitment is reached 
we have determined that the performance commitment was reached upon the effective date of the consulting agreement that occurred january  the fair value of the stock options was measured at that date based on the black scholes model using a fas approach 
per eitf  a recognized expense should not be reversed even if the option expires unexercised 
the stock compensation expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
on august  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded under our incentive stock plan 
as a result of this action  options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock became exercisable as of that date 
of these options  approximately  were out of the money at the time of the accelerated vesting 
the remaining  options resulted in stock compensation expense of  the stock compensation expense was calculated using the intrinsic value method  which compares the common stock option exercise price to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of modification 
this stock compensation expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made to avoid recognizing the related compensation expense in the future consolidated financial statements upon our adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment beginning in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  bingo terminal depreciation  goodwill impairment  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and our customer exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn our revenue in a variety of ways 
we offer our products for lease or sale 
we also sell service and software updates for our sold equipment 
bingo equipment revenue is recognized for bingo terminals and bingo systems installed as a single element placed in bingo halls under contracts based on a fixed fee per use per session  a fixed weekly fee per terminal  or a percentage of the revenue generated by each terminal 
revenue recognition is a key component of the company s results of operations  and determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
the company recognizes revenue when all of the following factors exist a evidence of an arrangement with the customer  b play or availability of the bingo terminals  c a fixed or determinable fee  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we exercise judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of customers to determine whether collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine the factors are not met for future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be adversely affected 
video lottery terminals our product sales revenues are generated from the sale of video lottery terminals  conversion kits  content fees  license fees  participation fees  equipment and services 
revenues are reported net of discounts  sales taxes and other taxes of a similar nature 
revenues related to contracted production are recognized as the related work is delivered 
we recognize license fee revenues over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
amounts received prior to completing the earnings process are deferred until revenue recognition criteria are met 
our sales credit terms are predominately days 
in certain limited circumstances  we may extend credit terms up to days 
reserve for bingo terminal obsolescence we provide reserves for excess or obsolete bingo terminals on hand that we do not expect to be used 
our reserves are based upon several factors  including our estimated forecast of bingo terminal demand for placement into halls 
our estimates of future bingo terminal demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete bingo terminals 
although we attempt to assure the accuracy of our estimated forecasts  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our bingo terminals and our reported operating results 
software development capitalization we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products that meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
provides for the capitalization of computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process to be sold or leased  after technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
we are capitalizing qualified costs of software developed for new products or for significant enhancements to existing products 
we cease capitalizing costs when the product is available for general release to our customers 
we amortize the costs on a straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning when the product is available for general release 
the achievement of technological feasibility and the estimate of a products economic life require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions  market conditions or other circumstances could result in an impairment of the capitalized asset and a charge to our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts bingo equipment we have established an allowance for uncollectible accounts based primarily on management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history and aging of accounts receivable balances 
our customer base consists primarily of entities operating in charitable  native american  and commercial bingo halls located throughout the united states 
in some jurisdictions  the billing and collection function is performed by a distributor as part of a distributor relationship  and in those instances  we maintain allowances for possible losses resulting from non payment by both the customer and distributor 
we perform ongoing evaluations of customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also reserve a percentage of accounts receivable based on aging categories 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of receivables  payment trends  and other available information 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in the financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of estimates of collectibility of our receivables 
video lottery terminals we estimate the possible losses resulting from non payment of outstanding accounts receivables arising from the sale of video lottery terminals and related equipment 
our customer base consists of casinos located in various states and native american casinos 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and distributors for credit worthiness  economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms  and historical collection experience when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment review  and depending upon the results of that measurement  the recorded goodwill may be written down and charged to income from operations when its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
the review for fiscal was completed as of july  the valuation date  and we determined there is no impairment of goodwill as of that date 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates reduced profitability associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
all of these assessments require management judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we estimate share based compensation at the award grant date and recognize expense over the service period 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the fair value estimate 
judgment is required in estimating stock volatility  forfeiture rates  expected dividends  and expected terms that options remain outstanding 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas no 
r 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
for the year ended october   we recorded an estimated loss contingency in the trend litigation of million  which was estimated based on the amounts of the judgment described in note to the financial statements 
we recorded an additional loss contingency of  in the third quarter of fiscal to account for the increased total award to trend for legal fees and expenses and costs of  in addition  loss contingencies of  and  were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  to account for interest accrued on the trend judgment 
with the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruling upholding each of the items we appealed  reversing the trial court s rulings and remanding the matter back to the trial court for a new trial  we believe there is no further justification at this time for accruing additional loss contingencies 
internal control over accounting for taxes in fiscal and fiscal our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that there was a material weakness and significant deficiency  respectively  in our accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our tax provision for fiscal years and  we identified certain adjustments to our tax liability accounts and related income tax provision 
all adjustments to correct these matters have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended october  and we have taken corrective action that as of october  remediated this weakness 
our remediation efforts have included engaging an independent public accounting firm to assist in the tax reconciliation and evaluation process  and increasing the skill and experience level of senior management 
in addition  we have developed definitive procedures for the detailed documentation and reconciliations supporting the income taxes payable  deferred income tax and tax provision balances and amounts  including the appropriate review and approval of related journal entries 
internal control over revenue recognition related to software contracts with multiple delivery elements we have identified a significant deficiency in our accounting for revenue recognition procedures related to software contracts with multiple delivery elements 
in preparing our financial statements for fiscal  we identified an adjustment to our revenue with respect to two invoices related to a single non standard arrangement with multiple delivery elements with a customer in our summit gaming division 
this deficiency constituted a significant deficiency in that it could adversely affect our ability to record the financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an adjustment to this matter has been made and is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal contained in this form k 
as of the filing of this report  we have updated our procedures for review of software contracts with multiple delivery elements and we will continue to increase the skill and experience level of senior management 
in addition  we are developing definitive procedures for the detailed documentation and reconciliations supporting the revenue relating to software contracts with multiple delivery elements  including appropriate review and approval

our credit facility agreement contains numerous restrictive covenants 
these restrictions could result in a curtailment of our capital expenditures including those for bingo devices  and related equipment 
in the event we were unable to raise additional capital if needed  further measures could be necessary  including the delay or reduction of our operations  research and development and other activities 
certain of such measures may require third party consent or approvals  including the financial institution under the credit facility  certain regulatory bodies  and others  and there are no assurances such consent or approvals could be obtained 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations  provide for budgeted capital expenditures  and meet liquidity requirements through the remainder of fiscal our long term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate at which we expand our business and whether we do so internally or through acquisitions 
in addition  we may pursue strategic opportunities that could require us to fund our portion of operating expenses of such ventures and may require us to advance additional amounts should any partners in such ventures be unable to meet unanticipated capital requirements or similar funding events 
to the extent that the funds generated from the sources described above are insufficient to fund our activities in the long term  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  as of october   we maintained an investment portfolio of approximately million in investment grade corporate issues  and in investment grade auction rate securities 
the values of these investments are subject to changes in interest rates 
however  because these investments are short term and are generally allowed to mature  we do not believe that any risk inherent in our portfolio is likely to have a material effect on expected cash flows 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
on march   we entered into a credit facility which consists of a term note for million and a revolving line of credit in the amount of million relating to the acquisition of summit gaming 
additional information about our credit facility is contained in note credit agreement to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of investments and interest payable on our credit facility 
the primary objective of our investment portfolio is to preserve principal while maximizing yields 
this is accomplished by maintaining a well diversified portfolio of high quality investment grade securities  all of which have an effective maturity within the next twelve months 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates at october  would have had an immaterial impact on the fair value of our portfolio 
annual interest income would have increased by approximately  given a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates 
because the interest rate on the credit facility is variable  our cash flow may be affected by increases in interest rates  in that we would be required to pay more interest in the event that interest rates increase 
assuming the million balance outstanding as of october  and the actual blended average rate of interest rate of  our monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate increased basis points to  which assumes an unusually large increase  our monthly payment would be  a more likely increase of or would result in a monthly payment of  or  respectively
