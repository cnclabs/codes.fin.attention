item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivative financial instruments 
business developments the following business developments have occurred since the beginning of fiscal acquisition in may fiscal  we acquired psf for approximately million in stock and cash including million of assumed debt 
psf is one of the largest providers of pork products to the retail  wholesale  foodservice  further processor and export markets 
psf is a recognized leader in the pork industry through its vertically integrated business model that combines modern  efficient production and processing facilities  sophisticated genetics  and strict control over the variables of health  diet and environment 
psf has processing facilities in missouri and north carolina 
psf is also one of the largest owners of sows in the us with operations located in missouri  north carolina and texas 
psf s results from pork processing operations are reported in our pork segment and results from hog production operations are reported in our hp segment 
discontinued operations smithfield beef in march fiscal  we entered into an agreement with jbs sa  a company organized and existing under the laws of brazil jbs  to sell smithfield beef  our beef processing and cattle feeding operation that encompassed our entire beef segment  to jbs for million in cash 
the sale to jbs will include of five rivers 
we also entered into an agreement with cgc in march fiscal to acquire from cgc the of five rivers that we do not presently own in exchange for million shares of our common stock 
this transaction with cgc will occur immediately before the jbs transaction  is conditioned upon the jbs transaction taking place  and will make cgc a beneficial owner of more than of our common stock 
paul j 
fribourg  a member of our board of directors  is chairman  president and chief executive officer of cgc 
michael j 
zimmerman  an advisory director of the company  is executive vice president and chief financial officer of cgc 
the jbs transaction excludes substantially all live cattle inventories held by smithfield beef and five rivers as of the closing date  together with the associated debt 
live cattle currently owned by five rivers will be transferred to a new joint venture between us and cgc  while live cattle currently owned by smithfield beef will be transferred to another subsidiary of ours 
the excluded live cattle will be raised by jbs after closing for a negotiated fee and then sold at maturity at market based prices 
proceeds from the sale of the excluded live cattle will be paid in cash to the smithfield foods cgc joint venture or to us  as appropriate 
we believe that most of the live cattle inventories will be sold within six months after closing  with substantially all sold within months after closing 
the proceeds from the sale of smithfield beef s live cattle inventories and our interest in five rivers cattle inventory  net of the associated debt  are expected to be in excess of million 
the respective transactions are subject to customary adjustments  including working capital adjustments 
the transactions are also subject to regulatory review 
we are currently in the process of responding to the second request from the antitrust division of the department of justice 
barring regulatory delays  we anticipate the transactions will close during the second quarter of fiscal accordingly  the results of smithfield beef are now being reported as discontinued operations 
we expect that the net proceeds of the transactions will be used for debt reduction 

table of contents smithfield bioenergy  llc sbe in april fiscal  we decided to exit the alternative fuels business 
in may fiscal  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of sbe for million 
as a result of these events  we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of tax of million  during fiscal to reflect the assets of sbe at their estimated fair value 
the results of sbe are reported in discontinued operations 
other developments classical swine fever csf in august fiscal  outbreaks of csf occurred at three of our thirty three hog farms in romania 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded approximately million of inventory write downs and associated disposal costs related to these outbreaks 
csf is a highly contagious  viral disease that affects pigs but has no effect on human health 
we worked closely with romanian authorities to contain the outbreaks and to destroy and dispose of animals on the three affected farms 
we do not believe there are any future material costs remaining 
we believe that we are eligible for reimbursement for certain costs associated with the euthanasia and disposal of the affected animals under governmental programs designed to compensate animal owners affected by disease 
romanian authorities have initially denied our claim for reimbursement of such costs 
however  we are still actively pursuing reimbursement 
any potential cost reimbursement would only be recognized in the financial statements in the period in which it is received 
there are no assurances that any funds will ultimately be collected 
reduction of us sow herd on february  fiscal  we announced a plan to reduce our us sow herd by four to five percent  or  to  sows 
we believe that this will ultimately result in  to  fewer market hogs annually 
we began phasing in these reductions immediately 
we do not believe we will incur significant costs associated with the implementation of this plan 
we may consider additional sow reductions if market conditions deteriorate 
regulation regulation in general like other participants in the industry  we are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal  state and other government entities  including the united states environmental protection agency epa and corresponding state agencies  as well as the united states department of agriculture  the united states food and drug administration  the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar agencies in foreign countries 
management believes that we currently are in compliance with all these laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
water in february  the epa promulgated regulations under the clean water act governing confined animal feeding operations cafos 
among other things  these regulations impose obligations on cafos to manage animal waste in ways intended to reduce the impact on water quality 
these new regulations were challenged in federal court by both industry and environmental groups 
although a decision by the court invalidated several provisions of the regulations  they remain largely intact 
similarly  the state of north carolina department of environment and natural resources ncdenr has issued general permits intended to protect state waters from impacts of large animal feeding operations 
although compliance with the federal regulations and state permits required some changes to our hog production operations resulting in additional costs  such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our hog production operations 
in the fall of  the waterkeeper alliance and others filed a rulemaking petition with the north carolina environmental management commission the commission requesting that the commission initiate a 
table of contents rulemaking to require monitoring of potential or suspected discharges from swine farms in north carolina 
on may   the commission accepted the petition and directed staff to form a stakeholder group to assist staff in developing a proposed rule for the commission s consideration at a later date 
although compliance with a new monitoring rule in north carolina could impose additional costs on our hog production operations  such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect of on our hog production operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the rulemaking will not result in changes to the existing monitoring rules which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
air the epa is also focusing on the possible need to regulate air emissions from animal feeding operations 
during calendar year  the national academy of sciences the academy undertook a study at the epa s request to assist the epa in making that determination 
the academy s study identified a need for more research and better information  but also recommended implementing without delay technically and economically feasible management practices to decrease emissions 
further  our hog production subsidiaries have accepted the epa s offer to enter into an administrative consent agreement and order with owners and operators of hog farms and other animal production operations 
under the terms of the consent agreement and order  participating owners and operators agreed to pay a penalty  contribute towards the cost of an air emissions monitoring study and make their farms available for monitoring 
in return  participating farms have been given immunity from federal civil enforcement actions alleging violations of air emissions requirements under certain federal statutes  including the clean air act 
pursuant to our consent decree and order  we have paid a  penalty to the epa 
prior to the acquisition of psf in may  psf s texas farms and company owned farms in north carolina also agreed to participate in this program 
the national pork board  of which we are a member and contribute funds  will be paying the costs of the air emissions monitoring study on behalf of all hog producers  including us  out of funds collected from its members in previous years 
the cost of the study for all hog producers is approximately million 
new regulations governing air emissions from animal agriculture operations are likely to emerge from the monitoring program undertaken pursuant to the consent agreement and order 
there can be no assurance that any new regulations that may be proposed to address air emissions from animal feeding operations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the state of missouri promulgated a rule that came into effect on january  to regulate odor emissions from large animal feeding operations such as the psf operations in missouri 
this rule required psf to develop plans to reduce odor emissions and to submit such plans to state authorities  which it has done 
this rule also required psf to make certain changes to reduce odors at the property line to certain established levels 
we do not anticipate material costs to comply with the rule as promulgated 
greenhouse gases despite the recent failure of federal legislation establishing a cap and trade mechanism for regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions  we believe there will be continued interest in the future in potential regulation of ghg emissions 
ghg emissions occur at several points across our operations  including production  transportation and processing 
it is not possible at this time to predict the structure or outcome of future legislative or regulatory efforts to address such emissions or the eventual cost to us of compliance 
regulatory and other proceedings from time to time we receive notices from regulatory authorities and others asserting that we are not in compliance with such laws and regulations 
in some instances  litigation ensues 
the waterkeeper alliance  an environmental activist group from the state of new york  has filed or caused to be filed a series of lawsuits against us and our subsidiaries and properties 
these suits are described below 
in february  the waterkeeper alliance  thomas e 
jones d b a neuse riverkeeper and neuse river foundation filed two lawsuits in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina against us  one of our subsidiaries  and two of that subsidiary s hog production facilities in north carolina  
table of contents referred to as the citizens suits 
the citizens suits alleged  among other things  violations of various environmental laws at each facility and the failure to obtain certain federal permits at each facility 
the lawsuits have been settled and resolved with the entry of a consent decree  which was approved and entered by the court in march fiscal 
the consent decree provides  among other things  that our subsidiary  murphy brown llc  will undertake a series of measures designed to enhance the performance of the swine waste management systems on approximately company owned farms in north carolina and thereby reduce the potential for surface water or ground water contamination from these farms 
the effect of the consent decree will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the consent decree resolves all claims in the actions and also contains a broad release and covenant not to sue for any other claims or actions that the plaintiffs might be able to bring against us and our subsidiaries related to swine waste management at the farms covered by the consent decree 
there are certain exceptions to the release and covenant not to sue related to future violations and the swine waste management technology development initiative pursuant to the agreement described below under environmental stewardship 
we may move to terminate the consent decree on or after march provided all of the consent decree obligations have been satisfied 
prior to our acquisition of psf  it had entered into environmental judgments and a consent decree with the state of missouri and with the federal government and a citizens group 
the decrees generally required that psf pay penalties to settle past alleged regulatory violations  and the judgments and decree and the voluntary agreement require that psf research  develop  and implement new technologies for environmental controls at the missouri operations 
in  psf entered into a consent judgment to settle a suit filed by the state of missouri 
the settlement required psf to invest million in capital expenditures to develop and implement next generation technology 
the proposed technologies were to be approved by a panel of independent university experts and were to be developed and implemented by in  the state of missouri filed a suit against psf for alleged new violations of environmental regulations  the settlement of which modified the consent judgment by i specifying that next generation technology be installed on the largest farms  and ii extending the schedule to implement next generation technology from until  in each case to ensure that the technology psf installs will be effective in reducing potential impacts to the environment 
in  psf entered into a consent decree with a citizens group and the u 
s to resolve alleged violations of the clean air act  clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
this consent decree was built upon the consent decree with the state of missouri referenced above and requires that the next generation technology employed meets certain performance standards  such as a percent reduction in nitrogen concentration of the effluent applied to area fields over a prescribed time period 
psf paid a civil penalty in the amount of  in connection with this settlement 
in  psf estimated that it would invest approximately million in additional capital for next generation technology by the deadline to comply with the requirements of both the state consent judgments and the federal consent decree 
as of april   we estimate such costs to be million  of which million had been spent 
included in this commitment is a fertilizer plant in northern missouri that converts waste into commercial grade fertilizer 
construction of the fertilizer plant has been completed at a cost of million 
recent decisions in fiscal by the panel of university experts mentioned above suggest that our obligations under the state consent judgments and the federal consent decree could significantly exceed the million estimate 
at this time  psf is reviewing the panel s decisions and is developing further technology proposals for consideration by the state and the expert panel  however  the technology development process is ongoing and it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome or the eventual cost to us of complying with the state consent judgments and the federal consent decree 

table of contents pursuant to permits and consent judgments with regulatory agencies  we also anticipate upgrades to wastewater treatment plant systems at smithfield beef s souderton facility and at certain smithfield packing facilities totaling approximately million 
environmental stewardship in calendar year  in furtherance of our continued commitment to responsible environmental stewardship  we and our north carolina based hog production subsidiaries voluntarily entered into an agreement with the attorney general of north carolina the agreement designed to enhance water quality in the state of north carolina through a series of initiatives to be undertaken by us and our subsidiaries while protecting access to swine operations in north carolina 
these initiatives focused on operations of our hog production subsidiaries in the state of north carolina  particularly areas devastated by hurricanes in the fall of under the agreement  we assumed a leadership role in the development of environmentally superior and economically feasible waste management system technologies 
pursuant to the agreement  we committed to implement environmentally superior and economically feasible technologies for the management of swine waste at our farms in north carolina following a determination made by an expert from north carolina state university  with advice from peer review panels appointed by him  that such technologies are both environmentally superior and economically feasible to construct and operate at such farms 
we provided million to fund the technology research and development activities under the agreement 
we also agreed to provide certain financial and technical assistance to those farms under contract to our subsidiaries as necessary to facilitate their implementation of such technologies determined to be environmentally superior and economically feasible 
these technology research activities have now been completed and the technology development  environmental enhancement and conversion agreement portions of the agreement remain in place 
although none of the technologies evaluated under the agreement were found to be economically feasible for existing farms  a specific solids separation nitrification denitrification soluble phosphorous removal system in combination with any one of four specified solids treatment systems was found to meet the environmental performance standards established under the agreement 
these combinations of technologies were found to be both economically feasible and environmentally superior for new farms 
we are committed to building on the technology research and development work completed under the agreement  and are in the process of evaluating options for continued technology development work in north carolina 
the agreement also reflects our commitment to preserving and enhancing the environment of eastern north carolina by providing a total of million to assist in the preservation of wetlands and other natural areas in eastern north carolina and to promote similar environmental enhancement activities 
this commitment is being fulfilled with annual contributions of million over a year period beginning in in  psf entered into a similar agreement with the attorney general of north carolina where it agreed to pay million to a fund for technology development  for environmental assessment activities  and for the defrayal of costs incurred by the state related thereto 
we have assumed a leadership role in the development of environmental management systems  and except for certain acquisitions including those in romania  some international operations and new facilities  all of our hog production operations and meat processing operations have developed and implemented environmental management systems meeting the requirements of the international organization for standardization iso 
iso is a standard which establishes a coordinated framework of controls to manage environmental performance within an organization 
to obtain iso certification  an organization must meet a rigorous and comprehensive set of requirements and criteria developed by experts from all over the world and submit to independent audits of its environmental management systems by third parties 
in addition  throughout the pork and international segments and our discontinued beef operations  we promote a variety of pollution reduction projects related to energy and water conservation  recycling and pollution prevention 

table of contents animal welfare program we have a formalized animal welfare program which we believe is one of the most comprehensive animal welfare programs in our industry 
our animal welfare program includes processes and procedures relating to the safety  comfort and health of our animals 
we retained the services of two internationally recognized experts on animal behavior and animal handling  who verified that our animal welfare program is credible  science based and auditable 
going forward  the audit component of our animal welfare program will be rolled into the national pork board pqa plus program  a national certification program designed to ensure that us pork producers understand and carry out their responsibilities to ensure food safety and animal well being 
our animal welfare program includes procedures designed to monitor animal well being at all stages of the animal s life through a series of checklists  inspections and audits 
through this program  our production personnel receive specific training in the proper methods and practices for the promotion of animal well being 
adherence to proper animal welfare management is also a condition of our agreements with contract farmers 
in january fiscal  we announced a program to phase out individual gestation stalls at our sow farms and replacing the gestation stalls with group pens 
we anticipate this will occur over the next to years 
we have begun this process with surveys to determine the best approach at each farm 
in the first calendar quarter of  we completed surveys at approximately two dozen farms 
three group housing designs at farms located in north carolina  colorado and utah were nearing completion in mid calendar we currently estimate the total cost of our transitions to group pens to be million 
we believe this decision represents a significant financial commitment and was made as a result of the desire to be more animal friendly  as well as to address certain concerns and needs of our customers 
we do not expect that the switch to penning systems at sow farms will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
employees the following table shows the number of our employees and the number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in each segment  as of april  employees employees covered by collective bargaining agreements pork international hp other corporate smithfield beef discontinued operations totals we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 
labor organizing activities occasionally occur at one or more of our facilities 
for example  we were involved in proceedings regarding union representation of employees at our facility at tar heel  north carolina 
this activity would determine whether approximately  employees at tar heel would be union represented 
in a proceeding involving the tar heel plant  the national labor relations board nlrb found that we engaged in certain unfair labor practices in connection with a prior representation election and ordered  among other things  that we allow a new election to be held 
we appealed the nlrb s findings with respect to unfair labor practices to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  which denied that appeal in may accordingly  we have now complied with the nlrb s order 
no nlrb sanctioned representation election has been scheduled at the tar heel plant  but we will participate in the election process at such time 

table of contents in october fiscal  we and smithfield packing filed a civil action against the united food and commercial workers union ufcw and several affiliates  alleging violations of the federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act rico and other state laws 
in our complaint  we allege that  on or around june  the union and some of its affiliates launched a corporate campaign against us  seeking to exert pressure on us to agree to allow union representation of the employees at tar heel without conducting an nlrb sanctioned secret ballot election 
we allege this campaign encompasses a wide range of activities  including the creation and promotion of misinformation about us and our business in an attempt to damage our reputation and brands  boycotts of our products  physical protests against us  our customers and spokespersons  and the exertion of political pressure on us at the local  state and federal levels 
we further allege that the ufcw and its co defendants conspired to engage in a public smear campaign in order to extort our recognition of the ufcw as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of hourly employees at smithfield packing s tar heel plant 
we seek more than million in monetary damages in addition to injunctive relief 
a hearing on defendants motion to dismiss was held in january the court denied defendants motion 
the case is currently in discovery 
we have informed the ufcw that we intend to pursue vigorously our claims against the ufcw and its co defendants
