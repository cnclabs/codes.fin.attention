also referred to as saia and the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
the company is a an asset based transportation company providing regional and interregional ltl services and selected national ltl  and guaranteed expedited service solutions to a broad base of customers across states

the company integrated the operations of the connection into saia motor freight in february the company integrated the operations of madison freight into saia motor freight in march our business is highly correlated to the general economy and  in particular  industrial production 
it also is impacted by a number of other factors as detailed in the forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this form k 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our network  as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by revenue per hundredweight yield and revenue per shipment  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased transportation  claims and insurance expense  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 
fuel surcharges have remained in effect in the ltl industry for several years and have become an increasingly significant component of revenue and pricing 
fuel surcharges are a more integral part of annual customer contract renewals  blurring the distinction between base price increases and recoveries under the fuel surcharge program 
the fuel surcharge program is intended to reduce the company s exposure to rising diesel prices and other costs affected by increased fuel prices  such as purchased transportation 
however  in recent years  given the significance of fuel surcharges  the negotiation of customer price increases has become commingled with fuel surcharges and fuel surcharges have more than offset higher diesel fuel costs 
we have experienced cost increases in other operating costs as a result of increased fuel prices 
however  the total impact of higher energy 
table of contents prices on other non fuel related expenses is difficult to determine 
a rapid and significant decline in diesel fuel prices would reduce the company s revenue and yield until we made the appropriate adjustments to our pricing strategy

outlook our business remains highly correlated to the success of company specific improvement initiatives as well as a variety of external factors  including the general economy

planned revenue initiatives include  but are not limited to  building density and improving performance in our current geography  targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable segments  as well as pricing and yield management 
the extent of success of these revenue initiatives is impacted by what proves to be the underlying economic trends  competitor initiatives and other factors discussed under risk factors 
planned cost management initiatives include  but are not limited to  seeking gains in productivity and asset utilization that collectively are designed to offset anticipated inflationary unit cost increases in salaries and wage rates  healthcare  workers compensation  fuel and all the other expense categories 
specific cost initiatives include linehaul routing optimization  reduction in costs of purchased transportation  expansion of wireless dock technology and an enhanced weight and inspection process 
if the company builds market share  there are numerous operating leverage cost benefits 
conversely should the economy soften from present levels  the company plans to attempt to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage 
the success of cost improvement initiatives is also impacted by the cost and availability of drivers and purchased transportation  fuel  insurance claims  regulatory changes  successful implementation of profit improvement initiatives and other factors discussed under risk factors

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates saia makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of saia include claims and insurance accruals 
the company has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to  per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for only the policy year march through february  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional  above its  per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by the company are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the company differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectibility 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pick up and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the company s accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the company s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
recovery of goodwill 
in connection with its acquisition of clark bros 
in  the connection in and madison freight in  the company allocated purchase price based on independent appraisals of intangible assets and real property and management s estimates of valuations of other tangible assets 
annually  the company assesses goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
this fair value based test involves assumptions regarding the long term future performance of the company  fair value of the assets and liabilities of the company  cost of capital rates and other assumptions 
however  actual recovery of remaining goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event remaining goodwill is determined to be impaired a charge to earnings would be required 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements in the form of stock options  cash based awards and stock based awards 
the criteria for the cash based and stock based awards are total shareholder return versus a peer group of companies over a three year performance period 
the company accrues for cash based award expenses based on performance criteria from the beginning of the performance period through the reporting date 
this results in the potential for significant adjustments from period to period that cannot be predicted
