this personal commitment connects our people with the vision and mission of boston scientific 
our management s discussion and analysis md a begins with an executive summary that outlines financial highlights of and identifies key trends that impacted operating results during the year 
we supplement this summary with an in depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects 
we follow this discussion with an examination of the material changes in our operating results for as compared to and for as compared to we then provide an examination of liquidity  focusing primarily on material changes in our operating  investing and financing cash flows  as depicted in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in item of this form k  and the trends underlying these changes 
finally  the md a provides information on our critical accounting policies 
on april   we consummated our acquisition of guidant corporation 
with this acquisition  we have become a major provider in the billion global cardiac rhythm management crm market  enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential  and further diversifying our product portfolio 
the acquisition has established us as one of the world s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapies 
as a result of the acquisition  we now manufacture a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities  including tachycardia abnormally fast or chaotic heart rhythms  bradycardia slow or irregular heart rhythms  and heart failure the heart s inability to pump effectively 
these devices include implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd and pacemaker systems 
in addition  we acquired guidant s cardiac surgery business  which produces cardiac surgery systems to perform cardiac surgical ablation  endoscopic vessel harvesting and clampless beating heart bypass surgery 
we divested the cardiac surgery business in a separate transaction in  see strategic initiatives within the executive summary that follows for more information on this and our other business divestitures 
we also now share certain drug eluting technology with abbott laboratories  which gives us access to a second drug eluting stent program  and complements our taxus stent system program 
see note c acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further details on the guidant acquisition and abbott transaction 
our operating results for the year ended december  include a full year of results of our crm and cardiac surgery businesses that we acquired from guidant 
our operating results for the year ended december  include the results of the crm and cardiac surgery businesses beginning on the date of acquisition 
we have included supplemental pro forma financial information in note c acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  which gives effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of and executive summary financial highlights and trends our net sales in increased to billion from billion in  an increase of million or percent 
our reported net loss for was million  or per diluted share  on approximately billion weighted average shares outstanding  as compared to a net loss for of billion  or per diluted share  on approximately billion weighted average shares outstanding 
our reported results included acquisition  divestiture  litigation and restructuring related charges after tax of billion  or per diluted share in  as compared to acquisition related charges after tax of billion  or per diluted share  in cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to billion in the increase in our net sales for was driven primarily by our acquisition of guidant 
worldwide sales of our crm business increased to billion from billion in  an increase of million or percent  on an as reported basis 
on a pro forma basis  including the acquired crm business for the entire year in  crm revenue increased million  or five percent 
the increase was a result of growth in the size of the worldwide markets for both icd and pacemaker systems 
we estimate that the size of the combined worldwide crm market increased six percent in  as compared to partially offsetting increases in sales of our crm products was a decrease in our coronary stent system sales 
worldwide sales of our coronary stent systems in were billion  as compared to billion in  a decrease of million or percent 
the deterioration was driven by decreases in sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems  attributable primarily to a decline in the worldwide drug eluting stent market size 
uncertainty regarding the perceived risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents has resulted in lower procedural volumes and contributed to the overall decline 
during  we successfully launched our taxus express drug eluting coronary stent system in japan  and have achieved a leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market 
during  worldwide sales from our endosurgery businesses increased to billion from billion in  an increase of percent 
further  our neuromodulation business generated million in net sales during  as compared to million in  an increase of percent 
at december   we had total debt of billion  cash and cash equivalents of billion and working capital of billion 
during  we prepaid million of debt and prepaid an additional million in january we expect to make a further payment of million before the end of the first quarter of and expect to continue to use a significant portion of our future operating cash flows over the next several years to reduce our debt obligations 
strategic initiatives in  we announced several new initiatives designed to enhance short and long term shareholder value  in  these charges after tax include a million charge associated with the write down of goodwill in connection with business divestitures  a million charge associated with on going patent litigation  million of restructuring related charges associated with our expense and head count reduction initiatives  an million charge for in process research and development costs  and million in charges related to our acquisition of guidant 
in  these charges included billion in purchase price adjustments related to guidant  associated primarily with a billion charge for in process research and development costs and a million charge for the step up value of guidant inventory sold  million in other costs related primarily to the guidant acquisition  and a million credit resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa program that we obtained as part of our acquisition of trivascular  inc late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot  or thrombus  within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent 
including the restructuring of several of our businesses and the sale of five non strategic businesses  as well as significant expense and head count reductions 
our goal is to better align expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make needed investments in quality  research and development r d  capital and our people that are essential to our long term success 
we expect these initiatives to help provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities  which will strengthen boston scientific for the future and position us for increased  sustainable and profitable sales growth 
our plan is to reduce r d and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses by million to million against a billion baseline  which represented our estimated annual r d and sg a expenses at the time we committed to these initiatives in this range represents the annualized run rate amount of reductions we expect to achieve as we exit  as the implementation of these initiatives will take place throughout the year  however  we expect to realize the majority of these savings in in addition  we expect to reduce our r d and sg a expenses by an additional million to million in restructuring in october  our board of directors approved an expense and head count reduction plan  which we expect will result in the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide 
we are providing affected employees with severance packages  outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support 
the plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as a part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value 
we initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of and expect to complete substantially all of these activities worldwide by the end of as of december   we had completed more than half of the anticipated head count reductions 
the plan also provides for the restructuring of several businesses and product franchises in order to leverage resources  strengthen competitive positions  and create a more simplified and efficient business model 
we expect that the execution of this plan will result in total costs of approximately million to million 
we recorded million of these costs in the fourth quarter of  and expect to record the remainder throughout and into we are recording these costs primarily as restructuring charges  with a portion recorded through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations 
refer to results of operations and note g restructuring to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information on these initiatives 
divestitures during  we determined that our auditory  vascular surgery  cardiac surgery  venous access and fluid management businesses were no longer strategic to our ongoing operations 
therefore  we initiated the process of selling these businesses in  and completed the sale of these businesses in  as discussed below 
we received gross proceeds of approximately billion from these divestitures  and estimate future tax payments of approximately million associated with these transactions 
the combined revenues generated from these businesses was million  or seven percent of our net sales 
approximately  positions were eliminated in connection with our business divestitures 
in january  we completed the sale of a controlling interest in our auditory business and drug pump development program to entities affiliated with the principal former shareholders of advanced bionics corporation for an aggregate payment of million 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a loss of million pre tax in  attributable primarily to the write down of goodwill 
in january  we completed the sale of our cardiac surgery and vascular surgery businesses for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a loss of million pre tax in  attributable primarily to the write down of goodwill 
in addition  we expect to record a tax expense of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with the closing of the transaction 
in february  we completed the sale of our fluid management business and our venous access franchise  previously part of our oncology business  for million in cash 
we expect to record a pre tax gain of approximately million during the first quarter of associated with this transaction 
refer to note e assets held for sale to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information regarding these transactions 
in march  we announced our intent to explore the benefits that could be gained from operating our endosurgery group as a separately traded public company that would become a majority owned subsidiary of boston scientific 
in july  we completed our exploration of an ipo of a minority interest in our endosurgery group and determined that the group will remain wholly owned by boston scientific 
monetization of investments during the second quarter of  we announced our decision to monetize the majority of our investment portfolio in order to eliminate investments determined to be non strategic 
following this decision  in  we monetized several of our investments in  and notes receivable from  certain publicly traded and privately held companies 
we received total gross proceeds of million in from the sale of investments and collections of notes receivable 
we intend to monetize the rest of our non strategic portfolio investments over the next several quarters 
the total carrying value of our portfolio of equity investments and notes receivable was million as of december  we believe that the fair value of our individual investments and notes receivable equals or exceeds their carrying values as of december   however  we could recognize losses as we monetize these investments depending on the market conditions for these investments at the time of sale and the net proceeds we ultimately receive 
refer to our other  net discussion and note f investments and notes receivable to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information on our investment portfolio and activity 
fda warning letters in december  guidant received an fda warning letter citing certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record keeping procedures in its crm facility in st 
paul  minnesota 
in april  following fda reinspections of our crm facilities  we resolved the warning letter and all associated restrictions were removed 
in january  legacy boston scientific received a corporate warning letter from the fda notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
in order to strengthen our corporate wide quality controls  we launched project horizon  which has resulted in significant incremental spending on and the reallocation of internal employee and management resources to quality initiatives 
it has also resulted in adjustments to the launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time 
we believe we have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the fda and continue to make progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions 
we engaged a third party to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess our corporate wide compliance prior to reinspection by the fda 
we completed substantially all of these third party audits during and  in february  the fda commenced its reinspection of certain of our facilities 
we believe that these reinspections represent a critical step toward the resolution of the corporate warning letter 
in addition  in august  we received a warning letter from the fda regarding the conduct of clinical investigations associated with our trivascular aaa program 
we are taking corrective action and have made certain commitments to the fda regarding the conduct of our clinical trials 
we terminated the trivascular aaa program in and do not believe this warning letter will have an impact on the timing of the resolution of our corporate warning letter 
there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these quality issues to our satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the fda 
our inability to resolve these quality issues in a timely manner may further delay product launch schedules  including the anticipated us launch of our next generation drug eluting stent system  the taxus libert  which may weaken our competitive position in the market 
if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda  we may need to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts  and the fda may take further regulatory actions 
outlook coronary stent business coronary stent revenue represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales for  as compared to percent in  as a result of our acquisition of guidant  which significantly expanded our product offerings  as well as a decline in our coronary stent system sales in we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated billion in  as compared to approximately billion in  and estimate that drug eluting stents represented approximately percent of the dollar value of worldwide coronary stent market sales in  as compared to percent in coronary stent market size is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention pci procedures performed  the number of devices used per procedure  average drug eluting stent selling prices  and the drug eluting stent penetration rate a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures 
uncertainty regarding the efficacy of drug eluting stents  as well as the increased perceived risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents  has contributed to a decline in the worldwide drug eluting stent market size 
however  recent data addressing this risk and supporting the safety of drug eluting stent systems could positively affect the size of the drug eluting stent market  as referring cardiologists regain confidence in this technology 
in october  we received ce mark approval to begin marketing our promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system  which is a private labeled xience v drug eluting stent system supplied to us by abbott 
under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the profit margin of a promus stent system is significantly lower than that of our taxus stent system 
therefore  an increase in promus stent system revenue relative to our total drug eluting stent revenue could have a negative impact on our profit margins 
we will incur incremental costs and expend incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize additional products utilizing everolimus eluting stent technology and to support an internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent system in the future 
we expect that this stent system will have profit margins more comparable to our taxus stent system 
see the purchased research and development section for further discussion 
in june  abbott submitted the final module of a pre market approval pma application to the fda seeking approval in the us for both the xience v and promus stent systems 
in november  the fda advisory panel reviewing abbott s pma submission voted to recommend the stent systems for approval 
following fda approval  which abbott is expecting in the first half of  we plan to launch the promus stent system in the us the following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales in millions year ended december  year ended december  us international total us international total drug eluting bare metal during  sales of our taxus stent system in the us declined million or percent  as compared to the prior year  due to a decline in market size 
decreases in drug eluting stent penetration rates  as well as decreases in pci procedural volume contributed to an overall reduction in the us coronary stent market size 
drug eluting stent penetration rates were percent exiting  as compared to percent exiting penetration rates decreased throughout  but appear to have stabilized at approximately percent during the fourth quarter of  which was largely consistent with the third quarter average penetration rate of percent 
we estimate that the number of pci procedures performed in the us in decreased eight percent  as compared to despite the decrease in the size of the us drug eluting stent market  we remain the market leader with percent market share for however  we expect that there will be increased pressure on our us drug eluting stent system sales due to new competitive launches 
until february  the taxus stent system was one of only two drug eluting stent products in the us market 
in february  however  an additional competitor entered the us drug eluting stent market 
our share of this market  as well as unit prices  are expected to be negatively impacted as additional competitors enter the us drug eluting stent market  including abbott s anticipated launch of xience v in the first half of during  our international drug eluting stent system net sales decreased million  or two percent  as compared to  due primarily to an overall decline in the size of the international drug eluting stent market 
sales of our drug eluting stent systems in our europe and inter continental markets were negatively impacted by declines in market size as a result of decreases in drug eluting stent penetration rates and decreased pci procedural volume  as compared to  driven primarily by continued concerns regarding safety and efficacy 
this decline was offset partially by the successful launch of our taxus express drug eluting coronary stent system in japan in may historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial end points 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  by our competitors or by third parties  or the market s perception of this clinical data  may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
in addition  the fda has informed stent manufacturers of new requirements for clinical trial data for pma applications and post market surveillance studies for drug eluting stent products  which could affect our new product launch schedules and increase the cost of product approval and compliance 
we believe that we can maintain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market for a variety of reasons  including the broad and consistent long term results of our taxus clinical trials  including up to five years of clinical follow up  the performance benefits of our current and future technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products  including opportunities to expand indications for use through fda review of existing and additional randomized trial data in extended use subsets  our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force  our sales  clinical  marketing and manufacturing capabilities  and our two drug eluting stent platform strategy  including our taxus paclitaxel eluting and our promus everolimus eluting coronary stent systems 
however  a further decline in revenues from our drug eluting stent systems could continue to have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include the entry of additional competitors into the market  including the recent approval of a competitive product in the us  physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug eluting stents  including expected abatement of prior concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis  drug eluting stent penetration rates  the overall number of pci procedures performed  average number of stents used per procedure  and declines in average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems  variations in clinical results or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  the outcomes of intellectual property litigation  our ability to launch next generation products and technology features  including our taxus libert paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system and our promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system  in the us market  our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel  and changes in fda clinical trial data and post market surveillance requirements and the associated impact on new product launch schedules and the cost of product approvals and compliance 
crm business crm revenue represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales for  as compared to approximately percent in  or percent on a pro forma basis  including the crm business for the entire year in we estimate that the worldwide crm market approximated billion in  as compared to approximately billion in  and estimate that us icd system sales represented approximately percent of the worldwide crm market in  as it did in the following are the components of our worldwide crm sales in millions year ended december  year ended december  us international total us international total icd systems pacemaker systems less jan apr net sales crm sales  as reported on a pro forma basis  our us sales of icd systems for remained flat with  with both the market size and our share of the market substantially unchanged 
our international icd system sales increased percent in  as compared to  on a pro forma basis  due primarily to an increase in market size 
we also experienced year over year growth  on a pro forma basis  in pacemaker system sales in both the us and international markets 
however  a field action initiated in by one of our competitors may have an adverse impact on the overall size of the crm market 
in addition  our net sales and market share in japan were negatively impacted by a decision made in by our crm distributor in that country to no longer distribute our crm products 
as a result  we are currently moving to a direct sales model in japan and  until we fully implement this model  our net sales and market share in japan may be negatively impacted 
worldwide crm market growth rates in and  including the us icd market  were below those experienced in prior years  resulting primarily from previous field actions in the industry and from a lack of new indications for use 
while we expect that growth rates in the worldwide crm market will improve over time  there can be no assurance that these markets will return to their historical growth rates or that we will be able to increase net sales in a timely manner  if at all 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the crm market and our position within that market include our ability to launch next generation products and technology features in a timely manner  our ability to re establish the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community  the referring physician community and prospective patients in our technology  future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors  successful conclusion and positive outcomes of on going clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use  variations in clinical results  reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies  our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel  new competitive launches  declines in average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed  and the outcome of legal proceedings related to our crm business 
in april  following fda reinspections of our crm facilities  we resolved the warning letter issued to guidant in december and all associated restrictions were removed 
we believe the fda s decision is a crucial element in our ongoing efforts to rebuild trust and restore confidence in our crm product offerings  and has allowed us to resume our new product cadence 
following the resolution of the warning letter  we received various fda approvals that had been pending and have since launched several new crm products 
intellectual property litigation there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market 
we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our existing competitors  including johnson johnson and medtronic  inc there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the coronary stent market 
see note l commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a description of these legal proceedings 
innovation our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through acquisitions and alliances 
our research and development program is focused largely on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions 
we now have access to a second drug eluting stent program  which complements our existing taxus stent system program 
we expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug eluting stent program  along with our internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent program  to continue to sustain our leadership position in the worldwide drug eluting stent market 
during  we expect to incur incremental capital expenditures and research and development expenses as a result of our two drug eluting stent programs 
we successfully launched our next generation drug eluting stent product  the taxus libert stent system  during in our europe and inter continental markets  and expect to launch the product in the us in the second half of  subject to regulatory approval 
in addition  we expect to continue to invest in our crm technologies  including our latitude patient management system  a technology that enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients remain in their homes 
in october  the fda approved expansion of our latitude system to be used for remote monitoring in certain existing icd systems and cardiac resynchronization defibrillator crt d systems 
in addition  we will continue to invest in our next generation pulse generator platform acquired with guidant 
we recently received ce mark approval for our next generation cognis crt d and teligen icd devices utilizing this technology and expect to launch these products in the us in the second half of  subject to regulatory approval 
we also expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug eluting stent and crm technologies 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance 
a delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth 
our acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective  high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs 
management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses 
however  our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions 
potential future acquisitions  including companies with whom we currently have alliances or options to purchase  or the fulfillment of our contingent consideration obligations may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing  depending on their size and nature 
further  in connection with these acquisitions and other alliances  we have acquired numerous in process research and development projects 
as we continue to undertake strategic growth initiatives  it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development projects 
we have entered a significant number of alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies 
many of these alliances involve equity investments and some give us the option to acquire the other company or its assets in the future 
we enter these alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
during  we began the process of monetizing certain investments and alliances no longer determined to be strategic see the strategic initiatives section 
while we believe our remaining strategic investments are within attractive markets with an outlook for sustained growth  the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute 
an inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings  or litigation related to these technologies  among other factors  may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances 
while we believe that the size of drug eluting stent and crm markets will increase above existing levels  there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of this recovery 
in  we will continue to examine and  if necessary  reprioritize our internal research and development project portfolio and our external investment portfolio based on expectations of future market growth 
this reprioritization may result in our decision to sell  discontinue  write down  or otherwise reduce the funding of certain projects  operations  investments or assets 
any proceeds from sales  or any increases in operating cash flows  resulting from these reprioritization activities may be used to reduce debt or may be reinvested in other research and development projects or other operational initiatives 
reimbursement and funding our products are purchased principally by hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers worldwide that typically bill various third party payors  such as governmental programs eg  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients 
third party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria 
reimbursement by third party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs  clinical outcomes and economic value 
these reimbursement methodologies confer different  and often conflicting  levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients  and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements 
third party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third party payors  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
there is no way of predicting the outcome of these reimbursement decisions  nor their impact on our operating results 
international markets international markets  including japan  are also affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs 
our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions  currency fluctuations  regulatory and reimbursement approvals  competitive offerings  infrastructure development  rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy 
any significant changes in the competitive  political  regulatory  reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  are under way in many countries in which we do business 
implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as japan  europe and other international markets may limit the price of  or the level at which reimbursement is provided for  our products and may influence a physician s selection of products used to treat patients 
we expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these markets 
in addition  most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices  and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions 
further  some emerging markets rely on the fda s certificate for foreign government cfg in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements 
our fda corporate warning letter prevents our ability to obtain cfgs  therefore  our ability to market new products or renew marketing approvals in countries that rely on cfgs will continue to be impacted until the corporate warning letter is resolved 
our limited ability to market our full line of existing products and to launch new products within these jurisdictions could have a material adverse impact on our business 
results of operations net sales the following table provides our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis versus versus as reported constant as reported constant currency currency currency currency in millions basis basis basis basis united states europe asia pacific inter continental international worldwide the following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported basis in millions versus versus interventional cardiology peripheral interventions vascular surgery electrophysiology neurovascular cardiac surgery n a n a cardiac rhythm management n a n a cardiovascular oncology endoscopy urology endosurgery neuromodulation worldwide we manage our international operating regions and divisions on a constant currency basis  and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level 
the relative change on a constant currency basis by division approximated the change on an as reported basis 
to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange  we convert actual current period net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant currency exchange rates 
the regional constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in note p segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
growth rates are based on actual  non rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely 
us net sales in  our us net sales increased million  or two percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to increases in us crm and cardiac surgery business sales of million due to a full year of consolidated operations in  whereas the results for these businesses were included only following the april  acquisition date in in addition  we achieved year over year us sales growth of million in our endosurgery businesses and million in our neuromodulation business 
offsetting these increases was a decline in us net sales of our taxus drug eluting stent system of million  due primarily to a decrease in the size of the us drug eluting stent market 
this decrease was driven principally by continued declines in drug eluting stent penetration rates resulting from ongoing concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of drug eluting stents 
our us drug eluting stent market share was stable during both and  we maintained continuous market share of at least percent throughout those periods 
see the outlook section for a more detailed discussion of both the drug eluting stent and crm markets and our position within those markets 
in  our us net sales increased million  or percent  as compared to the increase is related primarily to the inclusion of billion of us net sales from our crm and cardiac surgery businesses acquired in april in addition  we achieved year over year us sales growth of million in our endosurgery businesses and million in our neuromodulation business 
offsetting these increases were declines in us net sales of our taxus drug eluting stent system of million  due principally to a decrease in the size of the us drug eluting stent market  and a decline in our average market share in  as compared to in addition  decreases in net sales of approximately million were attributable to the first quarter expiration of our agreement to distribute certain third party guidewire and sheath products 
international net sales in  our international net sales increased million  or percent  as compared to the increase related partially to an increase in net sales from our crm and cardiac surgery businesses of million  due to a full year of consolidated results in  and million associated with increased sales of both icd and pacemaker systems 
in addition  net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in our asia pacific region increased million in  as compared to  due primarily to the may launch of our taxus express coronary stent system in japan 
the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations also contributed million to our sales growth in offsetting these increases were declines in net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in our europe and inter continental markets by million in  as compared to  due primarily to an overall decline in the size of the drug eluting stent market as well as market share declines in these regions  as additional competitive products entered the market 
see the outlook section for a more detailed discussion of both the drug eluting stent and crm markets and our position within those markets 
in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to the inclusion of million of international net sales from our crm and cardiac surgery businesses acquired in april the remainder of the increase in our net sales in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises  including million in net sales from our endosurgery businesses  as well as million of sales growth from our neurovascular business 
gross profit in  our gross profit was billion  as compared to billion in  an increase of million or seven percent 
as a percentage of net sales  our gross profit increased slightly to percent for  as compared to percent for for  our gross profit was billion  as compared to billion for as a percentage of net sales  our gross profit decreased to percent for  as compared to percent for the following is a reconciliation of our gross profit percentages from to and to year ended december  gross profit prior year inventory step up charge in shifts in product mix impact of lower production volumes impact of period expenses all other gross profit current year included in cost of products sold for was an adjustment of million  representing the step up value of acquired guidant inventory sold during the year 
there were no amounts included in our cost of products sold related to the inventory step up and  as of december   we had no step up value remaining in inventory 
factors contributing to a shift in our product sales mix toward lower margin products in included a decrease in sales of our higher margin taxus drug eluting stent system and an increase in sales of our crm products  which generally have lower gross profit margins 
in addition  we have manufactured lower volumes of certain of our products  including our drug eluting stent systems  which has resulted in higher unit costs during our period expenses included  among other items  increased charges for scrapped inventory in as compared to included in cost of products sold for was the million inventory step up adjustment discussed above  whereas there were no such amounts included in our cost of products sold 
in addition  increases in period expenses  including costs associated with project horizon  contributed to a decline in our gross profit percentage for  as compared to further  our gross profit percentage was negatively impacted as compared to due to shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products  including a decrease in sales of our taxus drug eluting stent system and an increase in sales of our crm products

during the second quarter of  we determined that our endovations system would not be a commercially viable product and terminated the program 
in addition  our r d expenses included approximately million in costs related to the cancellation of the trivascular aaa stent graft program 
see the purchased research and development section for further discussion regarding the cancellation of this program 
we do not expect these program cancellations to materially impact our future operations or cash flows 
in  our r d expenses increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of our net sales  r d expenses increased to percent in from percent in the increase related primarily to the inclusion of million in r d expenditures associated with our crm and cardiac surgery businesses  approximately million in costs related to the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program  million of stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of statement no

royalty expense in  our royalty expense decreased by million  or percent  as compared to  due primarily to lower sales of our taxus drug eluting stent system 
as a percentage of our net sales  royalty expense decreased to percent from percent for  due to shifts in our sales mix toward products with lower royalties 
royalty expense attributable to sales of our taxus stent system decreased million as compared to  due to a decrease in taxus stent system sales 
offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense attributable to crm and cardiac surgery products of million  due to a full year of consolidated results 
in  our royalty expense increased by million  or two percent  as compared to the increase was due to million of royalty expense associated with crm and cardiac surgery products 
this increase was offset partially by a decrease in royalty expense attributable to sales of our taxus stent system by million for as compared to  due primarily to a decrease in taxus stent system sales 
as a percentage of net sales  royalty expense decreased to percent in from percent in  due primarily to the inclusion of net sales from our crm and cardiac surgery products  which on average have a lower royalty cost relative to legacy boston scientific products 
amortization expense in  our amortization expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of our net sales  amortization expense increased to percent in from percent in the increase in our amortization expense related primarily to million of incremental amortization associated with intangible assets obtained as part of the guidant acquisition  due to a full year of amortization 
in addition  amortization expense included million attributable to the write off of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of advanced stent technologies ast  due to our decision to suspend further significant funding of r d with respect to the petal bifurcation stent 
we do not expect this decision to materially impact our future operations or cash flows 
these increases were offset by the inclusion in of the write off of intangible assets of million attributable to the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program  million associated with developed technology obtained as part of our acquisition of rubicon medical corporation  and million associated with our real time position management system rpm technology

the write off of the rpm intangible assets resulted from our decision to cease investment in the technology 
the write off of the rubicon developed technology resulted from our decision to cease development of the first generation of the technology and concentrate resources on the development and commercialization of the next generation product 
purchased research and development in  we recorded million of purchased research and development  including million associated with our acquisition of remon medical technologies  inc  million resulting from the application of equity method accounting for one of our strategic investments  and million associated with payments made for certain early stage crm technologies 
additionally  in june  we terminated our product development agreement with aspect medical systems relating to brain monitoring technology that aspect has been developing to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression  alzheimer s disease and other neurological conditions 
as a result  we recognized a credit to purchased research and development of approximately million during  representing future payments that we would have been obligated to make prior to the termination of the agreement 
we do not expect the termination of the agreement to impact our future operations or cash flows materially 
the million of in process research and development acquired with remon consists of a pressure sensing system development project  which will be combined with our existing crm devices 
as of december   we estimate that the total cost to complete the development project is between million and million 
we expect to launch devices using pressure sensing technology in in europe and certain other international countries  and in the us in  subject to regulatory approval 
we expect material net cash inflows from such products to commence in  following the launch of this technology in the us in  we recorded billion of purchased research and development  including a charge of approximately billion associated with the in process research and development obtained in conjunction with the guidant acquisition  a credit of million resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program  and an expense of million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting for our investment in endotex interventional systems  inc the billion of purchased research and development associated with the guidant acquisition consists primarily of approximately billion for acquired crm related products and million for drug eluting stent technology shared with abbott 
the purchased research and development value associated with the guidant acquisition also includes million representing the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments of up to million that we may receive from abbott upon its receipt of regulatory approvals for certain products 
we recorded the amounts as purchased research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory approvals  and the asset had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
we will recognize the milestone payments  if received  as a gain in our financial statements at the time of receipt 
the most significant purchased research and development projects acquired from guidant include the next generation crm pulse generator platform and rights to the everolimus eluting stent technology that we share with abbott 
the next generation pulse generator platform incorporates new components and software while leveraging certain existing intellectual property  technology  manufacturing know how and institutional knowledge of guidant 
we expect to leverage this platform across all crm product families  including icd systems  cardiac resynchronization therapy crt devices and pacemaker systems  to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart 
the next generation products using this platform include the cognis crt d device  the teligen icd device and the ingenio pacemaker system 
during the first quarter of  we received ce mark approval for our cognis crt d device  which includes defibrillation capability  and the teligen icd device  and expect a full european launch by the end of the second quarter of we expect a us launch of the cognis and teligen devices in the second half of  following regulatory approval 
we expect to launch the ingenio device in both europe and the us in the second half of as of december   we estimate that the total cost to complete the cognis and teligen technology is between million and million  and the cost to complete the ingenio technology is between million and million 
we expect material net cash inflows from the cognis and teligen devices to commence in the second half of and material net cash inflows from the ingenio device to commence in the second half of the million attributable to everolimus eluting stent technology represents the estimated fair value of the rights to guidant s everolimus based drug eluting stent technology we share with abbott 
in december  we launched the promus everolimus eluting coronary stent system  which is a private labeled xience v drug eluting stent system supplied to us by abbott  in certain european countries 
in  we expanded our launch in europe  as well as in key countries in other regions 
in june  abbott submitted the final module of a pre market approval pma application to the fda seeking approval in the us for both the xience v and promus stent systems 
in november  the fda advisory panel reviewing abbott s pma submission voted to recommend the stent systems for approval 
following fda approval  which abbott is expecting in the first half of  we plan to launch the promus stent system in the us we expect to launch an internally developed and manufactured next generation everolimus based stent in europe in late or early and in the us in late or early we expect that material net cash inflows from our internally developed and manufactured everolimus based drug eluting stent will commence in  following its approval in the us as of december   we estimate that the cost to complete our internally manufactured next generation everolimus eluting stent technology project is between million and million 
in  we recorded million of purchased research and development consisting of million relating to our acquisition of trivascular  million relating to our acquisition of ast  million relating to our acquisition of rubicon  and million relating to our acquisition of cryovascular 
in addition  we recorded million of purchased research and development in conjunction with entering the product development agreement with aspect 
the most significant purchased research and development projects included trivascular s aaa stent graft and ast s petal bifurcation stent  which collectively represented percent of our purchased research and development 
during  management cancelled the trivascular aaa stent graft program 
in addition  in connection with our expense and head count reduction plan  in  we decided to suspend further significant funding of research and development associated with the petal stent project and may or may not decide to pursue its completion 
we do not expect these program cancellations and related write downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially 
in connection with the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program  we recorded million credit to purchased research and development in  representing the reversal of our accrual for contingent payments recorded in the initial purchase accounting 
restructuring in  we recorded million of restructuring charges 
in addition  we recorded million of expenses within other lines of our consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives 
in october  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expense and head count reduction plan  which will result in the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide 
we are providing affected employees with severance packages  outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support 
as of december   we had completed more than half of the anticipated head count reductions 
the plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value 
key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses and product franchises in order to leverage resources  strengthen competitive positions  and create a more simplified and efficient business model  the elimination  suspension or reduction of spending on certain r d projects  and the transfer of certain production lines from one facility to another 
we initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of and expect to be substantially completed worldwide by the end of we expect that the execution of this plan will result in total pre tax expenses of approximately million to million 
we expect the plan to result in cash outlays of approximately million to million 
the following table provides a summary of our estimates of total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost type of cost total amount expected to be incurred termination benefits million to million retention incentives million to million asset write offs and accelerated depreciation million to million other million to million other costs consist primarily of costs to transfer product lines from one facility to another and consultant fees

 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits 
we expect to record the remaining termination benefits in when we identify with more specificity the job classifications  functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated 
the asset write offs relate to intangible assets and property  plant and equipment that are not recoverable following our decision in october to i commit to the expense and head count reduction plan  including the elimination  suspension or reduction of spending on certain r d projects  and ii restructure several businesses 
the retention incentives represent cash incentives  which are being recorded over the future service period during which eligible employees must remain employed with us to retain the award 
the other restructuring costs are being recognized and measured at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we made approximately million of cash outlays associated with our restructuring initiatives in  which related to termination benefits  other restructuring charges and retention incentive payments 
these payments were made using cash generated from our operations 
we expect to make the remaining cash outlays throughout and into using cash generated from operations 
as a result of our restructuring initiatives  we expect to reduce r d and sg a expenses by million to million against a billion baseline  which represents our estimated annual r d and sg a expenses at the time we committed to these initiatives in this range represented the annualized run rate amount of reductions we expect to achieve as we exit  as the implementation of these initiatives will take place throughout the year  however  we expect to realize the majority of these savings in in addition  we expect to reduce our r d and sg a expenses by an additional million to million in refer to note g restructuring activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information on our restructuring plan

users of our financial statements should consider this non gaap financial information in addition to  not as a substitute for  nor as superior to  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
management uses ebitda to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time

we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million during  which includes capital expenditures to upgrade further our quality systems and information systems infrastructure  to enhance our manufacturing capabilities in order to support a second drug eluting stent platform  and to support continuous growth in our business units 
our investing activities during included million of cash payments for acquisitions of businesses  investments in publicly traded and privately held companies  and acquisitions of certain technology rights  as well as million in contingent payments  associated primarily with advanced bionics  offset partially by million of gross proceeds from the monetization of several of our investments in  and notes receivable from  certain privately held and publicly traded companies 
in january  we completed our acquisition of percent of the fully diluted equity of endotex interventional systems  inc  a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries 
we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and approximately million in cash  in addition to our previous investments of approximately million  to acquire the remaining interests of endotex  and may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon endotex achieving certain performance related milestones

we paid approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  to acquire remon  in addition to our previous investments of million to acquire the remaining interests of remon 
we may also be required to make future payments contingent upon remon achieving certain performance related milestones 
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt  payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs 
during  we amended our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement and prepaid billion outstanding under the term loan  using million of cash on hand and million in borrowings against a credit facility secured by our us trade receivables 
there was million outstanding under this facility at december  and none outstanding at december  there were no amounts outstanding under our separate billion revolving credit facility as of december  and in addition  in  cash flows from financing activities included a million contractual payment made to reimburse abbott for a portion of its cost of borrowing billion in to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of guidant 
refer to note c acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information regarding the abbott transaction 
we had total debt of billion at december  at an average interest rate of percent as compared to total debt of billion at december  at an average interest rate of percent 
the debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of december   is as follows payments due by period in millions thereafter total term loan abbott loan senior notes credit and security facility in january  following the closing of the sale of  and receipt of proceeds for  three of our businesses  we prepaid an additional million of our term loan  reducing the scheduled maturity in april we expect to make a further payment of million before the end of the first quarter of these prepayments will satisfy the remaining obligation due in april and reduce the maturity by million 
we expect to continue to use a significant portion of our future operating cash flow over the next several years to reduce our debt obligations 
our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants 
among other items  our amendment extends a step down in the maximum permitted ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  as follows from to times to times on march  times to times on march   and times to times on september  the amendment also provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  of up to million of restructuring charges incurred through june  and up to million of litigation and settlement expenses incurred net of any litigation or settlement income received in any consecutive four fiscal quarters  not to exceed billion in the aggregate  through june  other than the amended exclusions from the calculation of consolidated ebitda  there was no change in our minimum required ratio of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  to interest expense of greater than or equal to to as of december   we were in compliance with the required covenants 
exiting  our ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda was approximately to and our ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense was approximately to our inability to maintain these covenants could require that we seek to further renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants  both of which could result in additional borrowing costs 
during  our credit ratings from standard poor s rating services s p and fitch ratings were downgraded to bb  and our credit rating from moody s investor service was downgraded to ba these ratings are below investment grade and the ratings outlook by all three rating agencies is currently negative 
credit rating changes may impact our borrowing cost  but do not require the repayment of borrowings 
these credit rating changes have not materially increased the cost of our existing borrowings 
equity on may   we extended an offer to our non director and non executive employees to exchange certain outstanding stock options for deferred stock units dsus 
stock options previously granted under our stock plans with an exercise price of or more per share were exchangeable for a smaller number of dsus  based on exchange ratios derived from the exercise prices of the surrendered options 
on june   following the expiration of the offer  our employees exchanged approximately million options for approximately million dsus  which were subject to additional vesting restrictions 
we did not record incremental stock based compensation expense as a result of these exchanges because the fair values of the options exchanged equaled the fair values of the dsus issued 
during  we received million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  as compared to million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during or we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in approximately million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments  which is in addition to our outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table  and is based on conditions in existence as of december  see note c acquisitions  note h borrowings and credit arrangements and note j leases to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information regarding our acquisitions  debt obligations and lease arrangements 
payments due by period in millions thereafter total operating leases capital leases purchase obligations  minimum royalty obligations unrecognized tax benefits interest payments  in accordance with us gaap  these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations relate primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business 
interest payment amounts related to our term loan are projected using market interest rates as of december  future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates 
the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of billion  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note k income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits 
certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration 
see note c acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our recent acquisitions 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  performance milestones will be reached  or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
additionally  we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash  including cash obtained through the sale of our stock 
payments due to the former shareholders of advanced bionics in connection with our amended merger agreement are accrued as of december   and therefore  do not appear in the table above 
certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december   which consisted primarily of financial lines of credit provided by banks and collateral for workers compensation programs 
we enter these letters of credit and bank guarantees in the normal course of business 
as of december   none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to fund any amounts from the guarantees or letters of credit and  accordingly  we have not recognized a related liability in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  or critical accounting policies and estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies 
we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of single use medical devices 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage  or implant  which indicates that the sale is complete 
for all other transactions  we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to the customer  provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
for multiple element arrangements  whereby the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations  we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value  and recognize the associated revenue over the related service period 
we generally allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings  for these transactions  we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer 
we offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers 
we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current 
we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates 
if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably  we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered 
we have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices 
we recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above 
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess  obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales and production levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess  obsolete or expired inventory in the future 
the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory 
valuation of business combinations we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations  including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development  which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill 
we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations  purchased research and development charges  and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
purchased research and development the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole 
in addition  we record certain costs associated with our alliances as purchased research and development 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions  we used the following ranges of risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows percent in  percent to percent in  and percent to percent in we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
impairment of intangible assets we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
in addition  we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
to test for impairment  we calculate the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
goodwill impairment annually we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of the year as of april  the beginning of our second quarter  using financial information available at that time 
we test our goodwill balances more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
in and  we identified our ten domestic divisions  which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment  and our three international operating segments as our reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
to derive the carrying value of our reporting units at the time of acquisition  we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination 
in addition  for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test  assets and liabilities  including corporate assets  which relate to a reporting unit s operations  and would be considered in determining fair value  are allocated to the individual reporting units 
we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our june interim financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate 
we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods  once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test 
investments in publicly traded and privately held entities we account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold percent or less of the voting stock 
we account for investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method 
our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity requires judgment 
we consider the guidance in apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  eitf issue no 
 accounting for investments in limited liability companies  and eitf topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments  in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity 
we regularly review our investments for impairment indicators 
if we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value 
see note a significant accounting policies and note f investments and notes receivable to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we recognized net deferred tax liabilities of billion at december  and billion at december  the liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions 
the assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves  litigation and product liability reserves  purchased research and development  investment write downs  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in light of our historical financial performance  we believe we will recover substantially all of these assets 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
we do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are billion at december  and billion at december  we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination 
see note k income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a detailed analysis of our income tax accounting 
legal  product liability costs and securities claims we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings  including intellectual property  breach of contract  securities litigation and product liability suits 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products 
we are substantially self insured with respect to general and product liability claims 
we maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims 
we record losses for claims in excess of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue anticipated costs of settlement  damages  losses for general product liability claims and  under certain conditions  costs of defense  based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
otherwise  we expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was million at december  and million at december  the amounts accrued represent primarily accrued amounts related to assumed guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded as part of the purchase price  as well as amounts associated with on going patent litigation involving our interventional cardiology business
