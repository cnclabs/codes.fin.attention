item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview 
we seek to increase shareholder value through consistent growth in our production and reserves  both through the drill bit and acquisitions 
we strive to operate our properties in an efficient manner to maximize the cash flow and earnings of our assets 
the strategies to accomplish these goals include developing our existing resource base acquiring additional assets with significant growth potential utilizing joint ventures with respected partners to enter new basins accumulating significant acreage positions near our producing operations investing our capital in a disciplined manner and maintaining a strong financial position notable items in achieved record production which averaged  boe d  up from achieved record cash from operating activities of million  up from achieved record net income of million  up from added million boe of proved reserves before production ending at a record million boe achieved a reserve replacement rate of expended million of capital expenditures  of which million was for development and million for acquisitions modified steam injection and new well fracturing techniques at n 
midway diatomite  increasing production from existing wells and decreasing the steam oil ratio to six to one started drilling the next well expansion on our n 
midway diatomite asset accomplished a day drilling record on a mesa location and significantly reduced the overall number of days and drilling costs in piceance completed gross net piceance basin operated wells which increased net production to average  mmcf d for the full year and  mmcf d in the fourth quarter achieved a record production average of  bbl d at poso creek by drilling an additional wells drilled horizontal wells at deeper depths at s 
midway to reduce the natural decline and identify additional resource opportunities entered into a long term crude oil sales contract for our uinta basin  utah production entered into a long term firm transportation contract on the rockies express pipeline for our colorado natural gas production sold montalvo  california assets with proceeds of approximately million notable items and expectations for targeting over net average production growth to achieve between  and  boe d targeting an increase in year end proved reserves to between to mmboe expecting a capital expenditure program of million to be funded wholly from operating cash flow drilling approximately wells at n 
midway diatomite and targeting production to increase to  bbl d average for the year for an increase of executing a gross net well drilling program at the piceance and expecting production to average mmcf d in drilling wells at poso creek targeting an average annual production of  bbl d with an average year end exit rate of over  bbl d continuing our appraisal of the lake canyon resource potential in the uinta basin by drilling four green river wells  three exploratory wells  and participate in deep wasatch wells overview of the fourth quarter of we achieved record average production of  boe d in the fourth quarter of  up from an average of  boe d in the third quarter of we had net income of million  or 
per diluted share and net cash from operations was million 
in december  we entered into a second long term ten year firm transportation contract for our colorado natural gas production 
this contract is for  mmbtu d on the rex pipeline and provides us assurance of significant deliverability of our increasing gas production in the piceance basin 
we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of stock see note to the financial statements and we had a pretax impairment charge of million associated with our coyote flats  utah asset 
berry petroleum company form k view to our challenge for is to grow our business through improved execution in a rapidly changing price and high cost environment while adding significant reserves through the drill bit 
we have an extensive inventory of development drilling in several basins  and expect our program to be the most influenced by production and reserve growth on our diatomite asset and our properties in the piceance basin 
our goal is to achieve at least a increase in production and a increase in reserves at a very competitive finding and development cost 
our million capital program is designed to achieve these targets while being funded entirely out of our cash flow from operations 
we expect no increase in debt in unless we are successful in acquiring assets and or wti pricing averages below per barrel 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that fit our growth strategy 
our previously announced plans to proceed with a master limited partnership for certain of our assets is currently on hold due to the unfavorable capital market conditions 
we will continue to monitor the economic conditions relevant to a successful offering 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures for totaled million consisting of million for development and other assets and million for acquisitions 
we also capitalized million of interest 
we funded these items from million of operating cash flow  million from asset sale proceeds and the balance from additional borrowings 
this compares to our total capital expenditures in of million  which consisted of million of acquisitions  million in development and other assets 
also  we capitalized million of interest in excluding the acquisition of new properties  in we have a developmental capital program of approximately million which we expect to fund wholly out of operating cash flow and based on wti pricing to average over per barrel 
we are proceeding with this program  but may revise our plans due to lower commodity price expectations  equipment availability  permitting or other factors 
our capital program allows us to continue high activity levels and as a result  we are targeting production to average between  boe d to  boe d 
in  we expect production to be approximately heavy oil  light oil and natural gas 
we have secured the necessary equipment and are currently meeting permit requirements to achieve the program 
development  exploitation and exploration activity 
we drilled gross net wells during  realizing a gross success rate of percent

generally  our california assets are mature our diatomite resource play and our poso creek properties are the exceptions and generate more cash flow from operations than is required to reinvest in these assets 
we have high capital needs in the piceance  uinta and the dj basins  where we have large undeveloped resources

production from this field relies on thermal eor methods  primarily cyclic steaming to place steam effectively into the remaining oil column 
this is our most mature thermally enhanced asset 
production averaged approximately  bbl d in we completed horizontal wells at deeper depths which slowed the natural decline of these assets 
these wells targeted resource opportunities below our existing horizontal wells and along the edge of the reservoir 
of these infill wells  were drilled to delineate and assess the resource base of a berry legacy asset at ethel d 
capital is focused on adding horizontal wells below existing horizontal wells  drilling ten vertical steam injection locations to place steam continuously along the edge of the reservoir  and further development at ethel d including the initiation of a pilot steam flood 
n 
midway in november  we announced our plans to commence full scale development of our diatomite project in california based on the performance of a two year pilot program 
we expect this development will increase production by up to  bbl d by as we develop the fairway  we will also appraise the potential of recovering additional reserves in the outer portions of our acreage in subsequent development phases 
we believe that the development is similar to other california fields 
production from the diatomite project averaged approximately bbl d in through implementation of a modified steam injection plan and new well fracturing techniques 
production continued to increase throughout the year primarily as a result of cyclic steaming 
we initiated the next phase of our development program in the fairway of the asset in the latter part of the third quarter and expect to be bringing these wells on production in the first quarter of installation of the necessary infrastructure  including steam generation equipment and fluid processing facilities  is also in progress 
capital is focused on drilling approximately wells  completing major infrastructure upgrades that will support future development  increasing steam injection and further refinement of our thermal recovery techniques including the testing of a horizontal well concept 
berry petroleum company form k s 
cal we acquired the poso creek properties in the san joaquin valley basin in early and have proceeded with a successful thermal eor redevelopment 
in the placerita field in the los angeles basin  we own and operate working interests in thirteen properties  including nine leases and four fee properties 
production relies on thermal recovery methods  primarily steam flooding 
poso creek responded favorably to steam flood injection and our accelerated infill drilling program performed solidly above plan 
production increased to over  bbl d in from less than  bbl d in we drilled over wells and installed a third steam generator during the year 
we expect continued production improvement as these wells are cyclically steamed  the additional steam flood patterns are brought on line and the balance of the infill wells are drilled and completed 
capital is directed at a well drilling program at poso creek and further expansion of the steam flood including the installation of the fourth steam generator 
the expected year end average exit rate at poso creek is over  bbl d 
piceance in the first half of  we made two separate acquisitions in the piceance basin in colorado  targeting the williams fork section of the mesaverde formation 
we acquired a working interest in  gross acres in the garden gulch property and a non operating working interest on  gross acres and a net operating working interest of in  gross acres in the north parachute ranch property 
we spent million to acquire a majority working interest in several blocks of undeveloped acreage located in the grand valley field 
we believe we have accumulated a sizable resource base with over  drilling locations which will allow us to add significant proved reserves over the next five years 
production averaged  mmcf d in we operated a four rig drilling program for most of the year and drilled gross net wells at garden gulch and gross net at north parachute 
significant progress was made in the last half of in reducing the days required to drill wells on our piceance asset 
during the fourth quarter drilling days on our mesa wells averaged days on garden gulch and days in north parachute and we are confident we can maintain this efficiency and expect improved economics as a result 
additionally  we continued to expand the infrastructure needed to support our operations  and have acquired additional firm transportation for future sales out of this region 
we plan to operate a four rig program with our capital directed at drilling gross net wells in garden gulch and gross net wells in north parachute  constructing the necessary expansion of our gathering and water handling facilities  and continued expansion of our road infrastructure including the construction of a new access road to our mesa acreage on the old mountain block of north parachute 
uinta the brundage canyon leasehold in duchesne county  northeastern utah consists of approximately  undeveloped gross acres which include federal  tribal and private leases 
we are targeting the green river formation that produces both light oil and natural gas 
along with an industry partner  we hold a  gross acre block in the lake canyon project  which is located immediately west of our brundage canyon producing properties 
we will drill and operate the shallow wells  targeting light oil and natural gas in the green river formation and retain up to a working interest 
our partner will drill and operate deep wells that will target hydrocarbons in the mesaverde and wasatch formations 
we will hold up to a working interest in these deep wells 
the ute tribe has the option to participate in each well and obtain a working interest which would reduce our and our partner s participation 
during the refinery capacity for our black wax crude improved from the constraints experienced during in february  we signed a six year oil contract with a refiner  allowing us to deliver  bbl d starting in july with up to  bbl d through june  upon the certified completion of its refinery upgrade expected in the first half of deliveries under this contract has allowed us to sell all of our crude oil production in the uinta basin and has stabilized our realized sales price and reduced transportation costs 
in we drilled gross net wells in the uinta project which included gross net wells at brundage canyon  six wells testing the ashley forest acreage to the south  and five wells at lake canyon targeting the green river formation 
in addition  we participated in the drilling of one lake canyon wasatch well with our industry partner 
average daily production during from all uinta basin assets was approximately  net boe d 
at the end of  we had one drilling rig operating in the basin 
capital at brundage canyon is directed at drilling additional wells targeting high graded locations across the field and further delineation wells on our ashley forest acreage to the south 
we are also evaluating the feasibility of waterflooding brundage canyon to further improve recovery and anticipate installing a waterflood pilot late this year 
the ashley forest eis continues to progress and we anticipate approval in the first quarter of capital at lake canyon is directed at the continued appraisal of our acreage with the drilling of four wells targeting the green river  and three exploratory wells targeting both green river and wasatch potential and to participate with our industry partner in deep wasatch wells 
berry petroleum company form k dj in  we made three acquisitions for approximately million establishing a core area in the niobrara gas producing assets in yuma county in northeastern colorado  where we have a working interest averaging approximately 
this acquisition in the tri state region eastern colorado  western kansas and southwestern nebraska totaled approximately  net producing acres and  net total acres 
our other two acquisitions in the region consisted of undeveloped prospective acreage where our working interests range from to 
our yuma county niobrara projects provide sustainable and steady cash flow resulting from low capital development costs  modest production declines and long life reserves 
we drilled over successful niobrara development wells in yuma county adding production from both proved undeveloped and probable reserves 
we continued to expand our compression and gathering infrastructure and acquired an additional square miles of d seismic data in colorado 
average daily production in the dj in was  net mmcf d 
we determined that our position in a portion of the tri state acreage was not sizable enough for us to continue with its development  thus we wrote down million of our tri state acreage carrying value in connection with the sale of these properties  which we believe approximates fair value as of december  based on available information 
capital is directed at drilling gross net niobrara wells  installing pumping units on gross net wells  and installing associated compression  gathering and water disposal facilities 
over square miles of d seismic acquisition in yuma county is planned for early obstacles and risks to accomplishment of strategies and goals 
see item a risk factors for a detailed discussion of factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenues 
approximately of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production under either negotiated contracts or spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
the remaining of our revenues are primarily derived from electricity sales from cogeneration facilities which supply approximately of our steam requirement for use in our california thermal heavy oil operations 
we have invested in these facilities for the purpose of lowering our steam costs which are significant in the production of heavy crude oil 
sales of oil and gas were up in compared to and up from this improvement was due to an overall increase in both oil and gas production levels and increased oil prices 
improvements in production volume reflect the successful results of capital investments 
while improvement in oil prices during were due to a tighter supply and demand balance  natural gas prices decreased as a result of the impact of high storage levels and mild weather conditions in the us oil and natural gas prices contributed roughly of the revenue increase and the increase in production volumes contributed the other 
approximately of our oil and gas sales volumes in were crude oil  with of the crude oil being heavy oil produced in california which was sold under contracts based on the higher of wti minus a fixed differential or the average posted price plus a premium 
our oil contracts allowed us to improve our california revenues over the posted price by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

we consume natural gas as fuel to operate our three cogeneration facilities which are intended to provide an efficient and secure long term supply of steam necessary for the cost effective production of heavy oil 
we sell our electricity to utilities under standard offer contracts based on avoided cost or srac pricing approved by the cpuc and under which our revenues are currently linked to the cost of natural gas 
natural gas index prices are the primary determinant of our electricity sales price based on the current pricing formula under these contracts 
the correlation between electricity sales and natural gas prices allows us to manage our cost of producing steam more effectively 
revenues were up and operating costs were down in the year ended from the year ended due to higher electricity prices and lower natural gas prices  respectively 
in  our electricity operations improved partially from the lower cost of our firm transportation natural gas we purchased 
we purchase and transport  average mmbtu d on the kern river pipeline under our firm transportation contract and use this gas to produce conventional and cogeneration steam in the midway sunset field 
the differential between rocky mountain gas prices and southern california border prices increased during compared to allowing us to purchase a portion of our gas at prices less than the southern california border price 
as our electricity revenue are linked to southern california border prices  the fuel we purchased at lower rocky mountain prices was the primary contributor to the increase in our electricity margin in berry petroleum company form k we purchased approximately mmbtu d as fuel for use in our cogeneration facilities in the year ended december  on september   the cpuc issued a decision srac decision that changes prospectively the way srac energy prices will be determined for existing and new so contracts and revises the capacity prices paid under current so contracts

because our interest in the revenue varies according to crude prices  the continuing development on this property will depend on its future profitability 
oil and gas operating  production taxes  g a and interest expenses 
we believe that the most informative way to analyze changes in recurring operating expenses from one period to another is on a per unit of production  or boe  basis 
the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years ended december amount per boe amount in thousands change change operating costs oil and gas production production taxes dd a oil and gas production g a interest expense total our total operating costs  production taxes  g a and interest expenses for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over the changes were primarily related to the following items berry petroleum company form k operating costs our operating costs increased primarily due to higher contract services and labor costs  higher compression  gathering  and dehydration costs and higher steam costs resulting from higher volumes of injected steam 
the following table presents steam information change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu including transportation as we remain in a strong commodity price environment  we anticipate that cost pressures within our industry may continue due to greater field activity and rising service costs in general 
based on current plans  we are targeting average steam injection in of approximately  bspd or a increase compared to production taxes our production taxes have increased over the last year as the value of our oil and natural gas has increased 
severance taxes  which are prevalent in utah and colorado  are directly related to the field sales price of the commodity 
in california  our production is burdened with ad valorem taxes on our total proved reserves 
we expect production taxes to track oil and gas prices generally 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased per boe in by from over the past year this increase has resulted from an increase in capital spending in fields with higher drilling and leasehold acquisition costs  which is in line with our expectations 
additionally  dd a may continue to trend higher as a certain portion of our interest cost related to our piceance basin acquisitions is capitalized into the basis of the assets 
we anticipate a portion will continue to be capitalized over the next several years until our probable reserves have been recategorized to proved reserves 
general and administrative approximately of our g a is related to compensation 
the primary reason for the increase in g a during was an increase in employee headcount to accelerate the development of our assets and our competitive compensation practices to attract and retain our personnel 
interest expense our outstanding borrowings  including our senior unsecured money market line of credit and senior subordinated notes  was million at december  compared to million at december  average borrowings in increased primarily due to our final payment on our piceance acquisition

we installed additional steam generators in california and as a result of the increased steam injection  our crude oil production on these properties increased 
the cost of our steaming operations varies depending on the cost of natural gas used as fuel and the volume of steam injected 
the following table presents steam information change average volume of steam injected bbl d fuel gas cost mmbtu including transportation production taxes during our production taxes increased as a result of higher assessed values on our properties  increased production and higher investment in mineral interests 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased per boe in due to large increases in capital spending since and particularly more extensive development in fields with higher drilling costs 
higher leasehold acquisition costs in through are expected to increase our dd a expense over the life of these assets as development increases 
our capital program experienced cost pressures in our labor and for goods and services commensurate with other energy developers 
as these costs increase  our dd a rates per boe will also increase 
general and administrative approximately two thirds of our g a is compensation or compensation related costs 
our employee headcount increased in as we added an important new core asset into our portfolio and as we strengthened our talent base 
other items increasing our g a in were contributions to fund the opposition of proposition in california  increased travel and consulting costs and a generally higher level of activity 
interest expense our outstanding borrowings  including our senior unsecured money market line of credit and senior subordinated notes  was million at december  compared to million at december  average borrowings in increased as a result of our piceance basin acquisitions during and capital expenditures program 
a certain portion of our interest cost related to our piceance basin acquisition and joint venture has been capitalized into the basis of the assets

we incurred exploration costs of 
million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these costs consist primarily of geological and geophysical costs in the dj basin 
we are projecting geological and geophysical costs in of between million and million 
in we incurred million of dry hole  abandonment and impairment consisting primarily of two coyote flats  utah wells for million  our share in an exploration well located in the lake canyon project area of the uinta basin drilled for approximately million net to our interest  four wells in bakken and four wells in the dj basin for million 
for the year ended  costs of million were incurred on the following one exploratory well on the coyote flats prospect  one well on the midway sunset property  two exploratory wells on northern brundage canyon in the uinta basin  and impairment of million on the remaining carrying value of our illinois and eastern kansas prospective cbm acreage were charged to expense 
income taxes 
the revenue reconciliation act of included a tax credit for certain costs associated with extracting high cost  capital intensive marginal oil or gas which utilizes certain methods  including cyclic steam and steam flood recovery methods for heavy oil 
we don t expect to generate the eor tax credit for  due to current oil prices 
as of december  we have approximately million of federal and million of state california eor tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future cash income taxes 
the eor credits will begin to expire  if unused  in and for federal and california purposes  respectively 
we experienced an effective tax rate of  and in  and  respectively 
the rate is lower than our combined federal and state statutory tax rate of primarily due to certain business incentives 
in anticipation of the continued full eor credit phase out in  we expect our effective tax rate to approximate  given the current oil price environment 
see note to the financial statements for further information 
commodity derivatives 
in march  we took a charge for the change in fair market value of our natural gas derivatives put in place to protect our piceance basin acquisition future cash flows 
these gas derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the price index in the derivative instrument did not correlate closely with the item being hedged 
the pre tax charge of million represented the change in fair market value over the life of the contract  resulting from an increase in natural gas prices from the date of the derivative to march  in may  we entered into basis swaps with natural gas volumes to match the volumes on our nymex henry hub collars that were placed on march  the combination of the derivative instruments entered into on march  described above and the basis swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas thus the unrealized net gain of million on the statements of income in under the caption commodity derivatives is primarily the change in fair value of the derivative instrument caused by changes in forward price curves prior to designating these instruments as cash flow hedges 
post may changes in the marked to market fair values are reflected in other comprehensive income 
asset dispositions 
we have significantly increased and strengthened our portfolio of assets since and expect to continue to make acquisitions 
we anticipate that we will dispose of certain properties or assets over time 
the assets most likely for disposition will be those that do not fit or complement our strategic growth plan  that are not contributing satisfactory economic returns given the profile of the assets  or that we believe the development potential will not be meaningful to us as a whole 
we divested several assets in proceeds from these sales contributed to the funding of our capital program

reserve replacement rate 
the reserve replacement rate is calculated by dividing total new proved reserves added for the year by total production for the year 
total new proved reserves include revisions of previous estimates  improved recovery  extensions and discoveries  and purchase of reserves in place 
this measure is important because it is an indication of growth in proved reserves and thus may impact our market value 
we believe our calculation of this measure is substantially similar to how other companies compute the reserve replacement rate 
see item supplemental information about oil gas producing activities unaudited 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
we achieve reserve replacement and growth primarily through successful development and exploration drilling and the acquisition of properties 
fluctuations in commodity prices  production rates and operating expenses have been the primary reason for changes in our cash flow from operating activities 
in  we revised our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to increase our maximum credit amount under the facility to million and in we increased our borrowing base from million to million 
on october   we completed the sale of million of ten year senior subordinated notes and paid down our borrowings under our facility by million 
as of december   we had total borrowings under the senior berry petroleum company form k unsecured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured money market line of credit of million and million under our senior subordinated notes 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for discussion of interest rate sensitivity 
capital expenditures 
we establish a capital budget for each calendar year based on our development opportunities and the expected cash flow from operations for that year 
acquisitions are typically debt financed 
we may revise our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions and or drilling outcomes or significant changes in cash flow 
excess cash generated from operations is expected to be applied toward acquisitions  debt reduction or other corporate purposes 
in  we have a capital program of approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
our expenditures will be directed toward developing reserves  increasing oil and gas production and exploration opportunities 
for  we plan to invest approximately million  or  in our heavy crude oil assets  and million  or  in our natural gas and light oil assets 
approximately two thirds of the capital budget is focused on converting probable and possible reserves into proved reserves and on our appraisal and exploratory projects  while the other one third is for the development of our proved undeveloped reserves and facility costs 
dividends 
our regular annual dividend is currently 
per share  payable quarterly in march  june  september and december 
working capital and cash flows 
cash flow from operations is dependent upon the price of crude oil and natural gas and our ability to increase production and manage costs 
combined crude oil and natural gas prices increased in see graphs on pages and and we increased production by 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the amount of borrowings and the timing of repayments under our credit arrangements 
we used our long term borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility primarily to fund property acquisitions 
generally  we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangement 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
in may  we sold our non core west montalvo assets in ventura county  california 
the sale proceeds were approximately million and we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale  including post closing adjustments 
production from the property was approximately boe d  which is less than of average production and  as of december   the property had million boe of proved reserves  which is less than of the year end total of million boe

we have seven long term transportation contracts on four different pipelines to provide us with physical access to move gas from our producing areas to various markets 
other obligations 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  and recognized no material adjustment to retained earnings 
as of december   we had a gross liability for uncertain tax benefits of million of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense  which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods 
as of december   we had accrued approximately million of interest related to our uncertain tax positions 
due to the uncertainty about the periods in which examinations will be completed and limited information related to current audits  we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods in which cash settlements will occur with taxing authorities for the noncurrent liabilities 
on february   we entered into a multi staged crude oil sales contract with a refiner for our uinta basin light crude oil 
under the agreement  the refiner began purchasing  bbl d on july  upon completion of its refinery expansion in salt lake city  which is expected in the first half of  the refiner will increase its total purchased volumes to  bbl d through june  pricing under the contract  which includes transportation and gravity adjustments  is at a fixed percentage of wti  which was near the posted price at the contract s starting date 
application of critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
berry petroleum company form k a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical policies 
successful efforts method of accounting 
we account for our oil and gas exploration and development costs using the successful efforts method 
geological and geophysical costs  and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties  are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
all exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion 
exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is under way or firmly planned 
oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
our oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that requires judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
projected future production rates  the timing of future capital expenditures as well as changes in commodity prices  may significantly impact estimated reserve quantities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense and impairment of proved properties are impacted by our estimation of proved reserves 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information and technologies become available 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different than projected 
reduction in reserve estimates may result in increased dd a expense  increased impairment of proved properties and a lower standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
carrying value of long lived assets 
downward revisions in our estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil or natural gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying amounts of our properties 
we perform an impairment analysis of our proved properties annually  or when current events or circumstances indicate that carrying amount may not be recoverable  by comparing the future undiscounted net revenue to the net book carrying value of the assets 
an analysis of the proved properties will also be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable from future net revenue 
assets are grouped at the field level and  if it is determined that the net book carrying value cannot be recovered by the estimated future undiscounted cash flow  they are written down to fair value 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on our estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves  future crude oil and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves 
for our unproved properties  we perform an impairment analysis annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s net book carrying value may not be recoverable 
derivatives and hedging 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income 
under the provisions of sfas  we may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash flow hedge 
both at the inception of a hedge  and on an ongoing basis  a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a hedge is designated 
similarly  a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
the expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset  liability or forecasted transaction to the derivative contract  or by effectiveness assessments using statistical measurements 
our policy is to assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter 
income taxes 
we compute income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes as interpreted by fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in our financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
additionally  our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods 
we may generate eor tax credits from the production of our heavy crude oil in california which may result in a deferred tax asset 
we believe that these credits will be fully utilized in future years and consequently have not recorded any valuation allowance related to these credits 
due to uncertainties involved with tax matters  the future effective tax rate may vary significantly from the estimated current year berry petroleum company form k effective tax rate 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin excludes income taxes from the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin also requires that amounts recognized in the balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions be classified as a current or noncurrent liability  based upon the expected timing of the payment to a taxing authority 
asset retirement obligations 
we have significant obligations to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related equipment at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the computation of our asset retirement obligations aro was prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires us to record the fair value of liabilities for retirement obligations of long lived assets 
estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  as well as to determine what constitutes adequate remediation 
we obtained estimates from third parties and used the present value of estimated cash flows related to our aro to determine the fair value 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated aro 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the related asset 
due to the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of our assets  the ultimate costs to retire our wells may vary significantly from previous estimates 
environmental remediation liability 
we review  on a quarterly basis  our estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  and the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of law 
our experience and the experience of other companies in dealing with similar matters influence the decision of management as to how it intends to respond to a particular matter 
a change in estimate could impact our oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on our balance sheet 
accounting for business combinations 
we have grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired may not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and the present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed were of interests in oil and gas assets 
we believe the consideration we paid to acquire these assets represents the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations 
stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r to account for our stock option plan beginning january  this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation effective january  the modified prospective method was selected as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under this method  we recognize stock option compensation expense as if we had applied the fair value method to account for unvested stock options from the original effective date 
stock option compensation expense is recognized from the date of grant to the vesting date 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical exercise behavior and berry petroleum company form k represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  the range results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of grant 
electricity cost allocation 
our investment in our cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering steam costs in our california heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
such cogeneration operations produce electricity and steam and use natural gas as fuel 
we allocate steam costs to our oil and gas operating costs based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of the cogeneration facilities plus certain direct costs in producing steam 
electricity revenue represents sales to the utilities 
electricity used in oil and gas operations is allocated at cost 
a portion of the capital costs of the cogeneration facilities is allocated to dd a oil and gas production 
capitalized interest 
interest incurred on funds borrowed to finance exploration and certain acquisition and development activities is capitalized 
to qualify for interest capitalization  the costs incurred must relate to the acquisition of unproved reserves  drilling of wells to prove up the reserves and the installation of the necessary pipelines and facilities to make the property ready for production 
such capitalized interest is included in oil and gas properties  buildings and equipment 
capitalized interest is added into the depreciable base of our assets and is expensed on a units of production basis over the life of the respective project 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this standard requires an issuer to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
in april  the sec issued a rule that sfas no 
r will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  as a result  we adopted this statement beginning january  we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

and fasb statement no 
was issued 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position must be more likely than not ie greater than likelihood of receiving a benefit before it can be recognized in the financial statements 
further  this interpretation prescribes the benefit to be recorded in the financial statements as the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions 
this interpretation also clarifies the financial statement classification of tax related penalties and interest and sets forth new disclosures regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
we adopted this interpretation in the first quarter of see note in september  sfas no 
 fair value measurements was issued by the fasb 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january   and we are currently assessing the effect this statement may have on our financial statements 

however  we do not believe that the implementation of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  staff accounting bulletin sab no

registrants must quantify the impact on current period financial statements of correcting all misstatements  including both those occurring in the current period and the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods 
this sab was adopted at december  the adoption of sab no 
had no effect on our financial position or on our results of operations 
berry petroleum company form k in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas no 
 entities that elect the fair value option by instrument will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option election is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity s election on its earnings  but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards 
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet 
this statement is effective beginning january  and we do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued a fasb staff position to amend fasb interpretation  offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts 
fin states that a reporting entity that is party to a master netting arrangement can offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under the same master netting arrangement in accordance with paragraph of interpretation fin will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january  and will have no effect on our financial statements as we do not post collateral under our hedging agreements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas was issued to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary formerly called minority interests and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures 
the effective date of this statement is the same as that of the related statement r

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to the financial statements  to minimize the effect of a downturn in oil and gas prices and to protect our profitability and the economics of our development plans  we enter into crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts from time to time 
the terms of contracts depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil and natural gas prices  acquisition economics on purchased assets and our future financial commitments 
this price hedging program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe crude oil and natural gas price downturn while allowing us to participate in any commodity price increases 
in california  we benefit from lower natural gas pricing as we are a consumer of natural gas in our operations and elsewhere we benefit from higher natural gas pricing 
we have hedged  and may hedge in the future both natural gas purchases and sales as determined appropriate by management 
management regularly monitors the crude oil and natural gas markets and our financial commitments to determine if  when  and at what level  some form of crude oil and or natural gas hedging and or basis adjustments or other price protection is appropriate in accordance with policy established by our board of directors 
currently  our hedges are in the form of swaps and collars 
however  we may use a variety of hedge instruments in the future to hedge wti or the index gas price 
we have crude oil sales contracts in place which are priced based on a correlation to wti 
natural gas for cogeneration and conventional steaming operations is purchased at the socal border price and we sell our produced gas in colorado and utah at the cig  pepl and questar index prices  respectively 
berry petroleum company form k the following table summarizes our hedge positions as of december  average average barrels floor ceiling mmbtu average term per day prices term per day price crude oil sales nymex wti collars natural gas sales nymex hh to cig basis swaps full year st quarter full year nd quarter full year rd quarter full year th quarter full year full year natural gas sales nymex hh swaps full year st quarter full year nd quarter full year rd quarter full year th quarter full year full year natural gas sales nymex hh collars floor ceiling prices full year nd quarter full year rd quarter th quarter crude oil sales nymex wti swaps full year full year full year payments to our counterparties are triggered when the monthly average prices are above the swap or ceiling price in the case of our crude oil and natural gas sales hedges and below the swap price for our natural gas sales basis hedge positions 
conversely  payments from our counterparties are received when the monthly average prices are below the swap or floor price for our crude oil and natural gas sales hedges and above the swap price for our natural gas sales basis hedge positions 
as of february   we entered into gas swaps for  mmbtu d at for the full year of and basis swaps on the same volumes for average prices of   
and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the collar strike prices will allow us to protect a significant portion of our future cash flow if oil prices decline below our floor prices which range from to per barrel while still participating in any oil price increase up to the ceiling prices which range from to per barrel on the volumes indicated above  and if gas prices decline below our floor prices which range from to per mmbtu while still participating in any gas price increase up to the ceiling prices  which range from to per mmbtu on the respective volumes 
these hedges improve our financial flexibility by locking in significant revenues and cash flow upon a substantial decline in crude oil or natural gas prices  including certain basis differentials 
it also allows us to develop our long lived assets and pursue exploitation opportunities with greater confidence in the projected economic outcomes and allows us to borrow a higher amount under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
while we have designated our hedges as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  it is possible that a portion of the hedge related to the movement in the wti to california heavy crude oil price differential may be determined to be ineffective 
likewise  we may have some ineffectiveness in our natural gas hedges due to the movement of hh pricing as compared to actual sales points 
if this occurs  the ineffective portion will directly impact net income rather than being reported as other comprehensive income loss 
if the differential were to change significantly  it is possible that our hedges  when marked to market  could have a material impact on earnings in any given quarter and  thus  add increased volatility to our net income 
the marked to market values reflect the liquidation values of such hedges and not necessarily the values of the hedges if they are held to maturity 
berry petroleum company form k we entered into derivative contracts natural gas swaps and collar contracts in march that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the price index for the location in the derivative instrument did not correlate closely with the item being hedged 
these contracts were recorded in the first quarter of at their fair value on the balance sheet and we recognized an unrealized net loss of approximately million on the statements of income under the caption commodity derivatives 
we entered into natural gas basis swaps on the same volumes and maturity dates as the previous hedges in may which allowed for these derivatives to be designated as cash flow hedges going forward  causing an unrealized net gain of million to be recognized in the second quarter of the difference of 
million was recorded in other comprehensive income at the date the hedges were designated 
additionally  in june and july we entered into five year interest rate swaps for a fixed rate of approximately on million of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the related cash flow impact of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 
irrespective of the unrealized gains reflected in other comprehensive income  the ultimate impact to net income over the life of the hedges will reflect the actual settlement values 
all of these hedges have historically been deemed to be cash flow hedges with the marked to market valuations provided by external sources  based on prices that are actually quoted 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes  consisted of million of unrealized losses from our crude oil and natural gas hedges 
deferred net losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  are expected to be reclassified to earnings over the life of the contracts 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
with respect to our hedging activities  we utilize multiple counterparties on our hedges and monitor each counterparty s credit rating 
net reduction of sales of oil and gas revenue due to hedging activities in millions net reduction of cost of gas due to hedging activities in millions net reduction in revenue per boe due to hedging activities based on nymex futures prices as of december  wti  hh  we would expect to make pre tax future cash payments or to receive payments over the remaining term of our crude oil and natural gas hedges in place as follows impact of percent change in futures prices on earnings nymex futures average wti futures price average hh futures price crude oil gain loss in millions natural gas gain loss in millions total net pretax future cash payments and receipts by year in millions based on average price in each year wti  hh wti wti wti total interest rates 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from long term debt
