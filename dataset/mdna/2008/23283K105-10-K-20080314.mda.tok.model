overview at cytori  our goal is to become a global provider of medical technologies  helping doctors practice regenerative medicine 
regenerative medicine describes the emerging field that aims to repair or restore lost or damaged organ and cell function 
our commercial activities are currently focused on reconstructive surgery in europe and stem and regenerative cell banking cell preservation in japan 
our product pipeline is focused on new treatments for cardiovascular disease  orthopedic damage  gastrointestinal disorders  and pelvic health conditions 
the foundation of our business is the celution system product platform 
the platform products process the patients cells at the bedside in real time so these cells may be re transplanted into the same patient in the same surgical procedure 
the celution system family of products consists of a central device and related single use consumables that are used in every procedure 
we are developing as many applications as possible for the cells  which are processed by the celution system family of products  in order to increase and maximize sales of the central device and related consumables to hospitals  clinics  and physicians 
the celution and are bedside systems that separate stem and regenerative cells residing naturally within adipose fat tissue 
we are introducing the celution crs in europe into the reconstructive surgery market and the celution mb in japan as part of our comprehensive stem cell banking cryopreservation product offering 
we believe these two markets offer the potential for revenue growth over the next few years until new products come out of our development pipeline 
this product development pipeline includes applications for cardiovascular disease  for which two clinical trials are presently underway in europe  spinal disc repair  gastrointestinal disorders  and pelvic health conditions 
in  we will focus on the following initiatives launching the stemsource cell bank to hospitals in japan through our commercialization partner  green hospital supply  inc introducing the celution crs in europe and asia pacific into the reconstructive surgery market to select physicians and hospitals through our specialized medical distribution network 
initiating two post marketing studies in europe with the celution crs for the reconstruction of breast tissue following partial mastectomy to support expanded marketing efforts and reimbursement 
advancing our cardiovascular disease product pipeline through clinical development 
continue pursuing development and commercialization partnerships for certain therapeutic applications outside our primary focus of reconstructive surgery and cardiovascular disease 
during  we laid the foundation for our commercial introduction of the celution crs into the european reconstructive surgery market 
a broader launch is expected following the successful completion of two planned breast reconstruction post partial mastectomy post marketing studies designed to provide cytori with additional clinical data to support broad physician adoption and reimbursement 
breast reconstruction is a niche market that we are pursuing because there is a significant medical need for viable reconstructive alternatives to partial mastectomy patients 
this segment of the reconstructive surgery market may also be effectively addressed with targeted sales and distribution efforts 
there are an estimated  patients in europe diagnosed each year with breast cancer  of which approximately are eligible to undergo partial mastectomy 
based on this figure and the survival rate for breast cancer patients  there are already millions of women in europe who have been treated for breast cancer  for which a percentage could be eligible for partial mastectomy defect reconstruction 
reconstruction of partial mastectomy defects using adipose derived stem and regenerative cells  processed with the celution system a predecessor to the celution system  was reported in december to be safe and effective in a patient  investigator initiated study in japan 
while more clinical trials will be required  the study observed that combining adipose derived stem and regenerative cells with additional adipose tissue in order to fill the defect area was safe and resulted in patient satisfaction  with a statistically significant improvement and maintenance of tissue thickness six months following surgery 
these results formed the basis for the design of our two company sponsored post marketing studies in europe 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a partnership to commercialize the celution based stemsource cell bank to hospitals throughout japan 
this partnership is important as it allows us to capitalize near term in a scalable fashion on another application for the celution system platform  the cryopreservation of cells  which is estimated to be a large  untapped medical market in japan 
the first cell banks are expected to be installed by the first half of in the united states  we are planning to expand the commercial efforts for the stemsource cell bank business starting in the middle of through limited marketing activities 
unlike in japan  we will process and store any orders from patients at our licensed cryopreservation facility in san diego 
once established we may continue to commercialize on our own or license the us stemsourcetm business to a strategic partner 
the most advanced therapeutic application in our product development pipeline is cardiovascular disease 
we currently have two clinical trials underway for adipose derived stem and regenerative cells for the treatment of cardiovascular disease  one targeting a chronic form of heart disease and the other targeting heart attacks  an acute form of heart disease 
we identified this market as a priority because we believe there is significant need for new forms of cardiovascular disease treatment and because it represents one of the largest global healthcare market opportunities 
the american heart association estimates that in the united states of america alone  there are approximately  heart attacks each year and more than  people suffer from coronary heart disease 
olympus partnership on november   we entered into a strategic development and manufacturing joint venture agreement and other related agreements jv agreements with olympus corporation olympus 
as part of the terms of the jv agreements  we formed a joint venture  olympus cytori  inc the joint venture  to develop and manufacture future generation devices based on our celution system platform 
under the joint venture agreements olympus paid  for its interest in the joint venture 
moreover  olympus simultaneously entered into a license joint development agreement with the joint venture and us to develop a second generation commercial system and manufacturing capabilities 
we licensed our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  to the joint venture for use in future generation devices 
these devices will process and purify adult stem and regenerative cells residing in adipose fat tissue for various therapeutic clinical applications 
in exchange for this license  we received a interest in the joint venture  as well as an initial  payment from the joint venture  the source of this payment was the  contributed to the joint venture by olympus 
moreover  upon receipt of a ce mark for the first generation celution system platform in january  we received an additional  development milestone payment from the joint venture 
put calls and guarantees the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to cytori at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
as of november   the fair value of the put was determined to be  at december  and  the fair value of the put was  and  respectively 
fluctuations in the put value are recorded in the statements of operations as a component of change in fair value of option liabilities 
the fair value of the put has been recorded as a long term liability on the balance sheet in the caption option liability 
the following assumptions were employed in estimating the value of the put december  december  november  expected volatility of cytori expected volatility of the joint venture bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori bankruptcy threshold for cytori probability of a change of control event for cytori expected correlation between fair values of cytori and the joint venture in the future risk free interest rate the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put and mark it to market each quarter until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
the joint venture currently has exclusive access to our technology for the development  manufacture  and supply of the devices second generation and beyond for all therapeutic applications 
once a later generation celution system is developed and approved by regulatory agencies  the joint venture would sell such systems exclusively to us at a formula based transfer price  we have retained marketing rights to the second generation devices for all therapeutic applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells 
we have worked closely with olympus team of scientists and engineers to design the future generations celution system so that it will contain certain product enhancements and that can be manufactured in a streamlined manner 
in august  we entered into a license and royalty agreement royalty agreement with the joint venture which provides us the ability to commercially launch the celution system platform earlier than we could have otherwise done so under the terms of the joint venture agreements 
the royalty agreement allows for the sale of the cytori developed celution system platform until such time as the joint venture s products are commercially available for the same market served by cytori platform  subject to a reasonable royalty that will be payable to the joint venture for all such sales 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
other related party transactions as part of the formation of the joint venture and as discussed above  the joint venture agreed to purchase development services from olympus 
in december  the joint venture paid to olympus  as a payment for those services 
the payment has been recognized in its entirety as an expense on the books and records of the joint venture as the expenditure represents a payment for research and development services that have no alternative future uses 
our share of this expense has been reflected within the account  equity loss from investment in joint venture  within the consolidated statement of operations 
in a separate agreement entered into on february   we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus will conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right will terminate 
in the third quarter of  we received net proceeds of  from the sale of common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement  of which  of common stock was purchased by olympus 
macropore biosurgery spine and orthopedic products by selling our spine and orthopedic surgical implant business to kensey nash corporation kensey nash in the second quarter of  we have completed our transition away from the bioresorbable product line for which we were originally founded 
thin film japan distribution agreement in  we sold the majority of our thin film business to mast 
we retained all rights to thin film business in japan subject to a purchase option of mast  which expired in may  and we received back from mast a license of all rights to thin film technologies in the spinal field  exclusive at least until  and the field of regenerative medicine  non exclusive on a perpetual basis 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a distribution agreement with senko 
under this agreement  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
specifically  the license covers thin film products with the following indications anti adhesion  soft tissue support  and minimization of the attachment of soft tissues 
the distribution agreement with senko commences upon commercialization 
commercialization will occur when one or more thin film product registrations are completed with the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare mhlw 
following commercialization  the distribution agreement has a duration of five years and is renewable for an additional five years after reaching mutually agreed minimum purchase guarantees 
we received a  upfront license fee from senko 
we have recorded the  received as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
under the distribution agreement  we will also be entitled to earn additional payments from senko based on achieving defined milestones 
on september   we notified senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product 
as a result  we became entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  which we received in october and recorded as a component of deferred revenues 
to date we have recognized a total of  in development revenues    and  for the years ended december     and  respectively related to this agreement 
capital requirements and liquidity research and development for the celution system product platform and clinical applications of adipose derived stem and regenerative cell therapies has been and will continue to be very costly 
we anticipate expanding research and development expenses to fund clinical trials which were initiated in  pre clinical research  and general and administrative activities 
as a result  we expect to continue incurring losses in the near future 
over of our research and development expenses of  were related to our regenerative cell technology business  and the majority of those were related to optimizing the celutiontm crs for reconstructive surgery research and development of cardiovascular disease applications 
we believe research and development expenses will continue to increase should we advance more products into and through clinical trials and as we continue our commercial introductions 
we plan to fund this anticipated research and development from existing cash and short term investments  payments  if any  related to potential celution system platform commercialization partnerships  payments  if any  related to potential biomaterial divestitures  potential research grants  and sale of common stock through potential future financings 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand of  and an accumulated deficit of  on february   we entered into an agreement to sell  shares of common stock at per share to green hospital supply  inc in a private placement 
on february  we closed the first half of the private placement with green hospital supply  inc and received  we have agreed to close the second half of the private placement on or before april  results of operations product revenues product revenues relate entirely to our macropore biosurgery segment

during the years ended december    and  we recorded a provision of   and  respectively  related to excess and slow moving inventory 
in and  this inventory was produced in anticipation of stocking orders from medtronic which did not materialize 
the future 
we expect to incur costs related to our products once commercialization is achieved for our japan thin film product line  and now that manufacturing of our celution system platform has begun

during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing a pre clinical study milestone in the second quarter and completing a development milestone in the third quarter 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing a pre clinical study milestone in the first quarter  receiving a ce mark for the celution system  and reaching three additional milestones in the fourth quarter 
one milestone related to the completion of a pre clinical study while the other two were results of product development efforts 
there was no similar revenue in the research grant revenue related to our agreement with the national institutes of health nih 
under this arrangement  the nih reimbursed us for qualifying expenditures related to research on adipose derived cell therapy for myocardial infarction 
to receive funds under the grant arrangement  we were required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the grant agreement between the nih and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to research on adipose derived cell therapy for myocardial infarction  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate protocols established by the nih 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in expenditures  of which  were qualified 
we recorded a total of  in revenues for the year ended december   which included allowable grant fees as well as cost reimbursements 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in qualifying expenditures 
we recorded a total of  in revenues for the years ended december   which include allowable grant fees as well as cost reimbursements 
our work under this nih agreement was completed in  as a result  there were no comparable revenues or costs in macropore biosurgery thin film under a distribution agreement with senko we are entitled to earn payments based on achieving the following defined milestones upon notifying senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product  we were entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  we so notified senko on september   received payment in october of  and recorded deferred revenues of  as of december   of the amount deferred  we have recognized development revenues of   in   in   in  and  prior to 
in addition  we also received a  license fee that was recorded as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
because the  in license fees is potentially refundable  such amounts will not be recognized as revenues until the refund rights expire 
specifically  half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
we are also entitled to a non refundable payment of  once we achieve commercialization 
the future we expect to recognize revenues from our regenerative cell technology segment during as we complete additional research and development activities 
if we are successful in achieving certain milestone points related to these activities  we will recognize approximately  in revenues in the exact timing of when amounts will be reported in revenue will depend on internal and external considerations  including obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for various therapeutic applications related to the celution system platform 
the cash for these performance obligations was received when the agreement was signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us 
additionally  we expect to recognize approximately  in revenues during from the newly awarded nih grant 
we were awarded  late to study adipose derived stem and regenerative cells for vascular disease 
we will continue to recognize revenue from the development work we are performing on behalf of senko  based on the relative fair value of the milestones completed as compared to the total efforts expected to be necessary to obtain regulatory clearance with the mhlw 
obtaining regulatory clearance with the mhlw for initial commercialization is expected in accordingly  we expect to recognize approximately  consisting of  in deferred revenues plus a non refundable payment of  to be received upon commercialization in revenues associated with this milestone arrangement in moreover  we expect to recognize  per year associated with deferred senko license fees over a three year period following commercialization as the refund rights associated with the license payment expire

these expenses  in conjunction with our continued development efforts related to our celution system platform  result primarily from the broad expansion of our research and development efforts enabled by the funding we received from olympus in and and from other investors in and professional services expense which includes pre clinical and clinical study costs decreased by  from to  of which  was attributed to a decrease in pre clinical and clinical study expense primarily due to a transition in focus from pre clinical studies to clinical studies 
although clinical study costs are expected to exceed those for pre clinical studies  they are also typically spread out over a longer period of time 
rent and utilities expense decreased by  from to primarily due the termination of leases at our top gun location in san diego  ca 
these decreases were offset by an increase in travel expense of  and an increase in repair and maintenance expense of  from to the increase in regenerative cell technology expenses from to was due primarily to the hiring of additional researchers  engineers  and support staff 
it was also a result of increased costs for pre clinical and clinical studies conducted in as compared with as well as increased rent and utility expense due to the addition of our new facility during the latter half of expenditures related to the joint venture with olympus  which are included in the variation analysis above  include costs that are necessary to support the commercialization of future generation devices  including the next generation celution device 
these development activities  which began in november  include performing pre clinical and clinical studies  seeking regulatory approval  and performing product development related to therapeutic applications for adipose stem and regenerative cells for multiple large markets

macropore biosurgery general corporate marketing expenditures related to expenditures for maintaining our corporate image and reputation within the research and surgical communities 
expenditures in this area declined to  in as we focused more on our regenerative cell technology business and exited from our spine and orthopedic implant business 
the decrease from the year ended december  as compared to was due to a strategic decision to allocate resources towards our regenerative cell technology marketing  which in turn prompted a reduction in headcount in biomaterials and general corporate marketing 
international sales and marketing expenditures relate to costs associated with developing an international bioresorbable thin film distributor and supporting a bioresorbable thin film sales office in japan 
the decreased spending in as compared to relates to a significant headcount decrease in this marketing group as mhlw approval for commercialization has been delayed from our original expectation

as a result  we have begun efforts to restrain general and administrative expense 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  substantial legal expenses in connection with the university of pittsburgh s lawsuit 
although we are not litigants and are not responsible for any settlement costs  if the university of pittsburgh wins the lawsuit our license rights to the patent in question could be nullified or rendered non exclusive and our regenerative cell strategy could be affected 
the amended uc license agreement signed in the third quarter of clarified that we are responsible for all patent prosecution and litigation costs related to this lawsuit 
stock based compensation expenses as noted previously  we adopted sfas r on january  period figures have not been restated and therefore are not comparable to the and presentation 
stock based compensation expenses include charges related to options issued to employees  directors and non employees 
prior to january   the stock based compensation expenditures connected to options granted to employees and directors in their capacity as board members is the difference between the exercise price of the stock based awards and the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
unearned employee stock based compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options  which generally vest over a four year period from the date of grant

the incremental value of the options due to the modification was  we recorded an expense in the third quarter of to reflect the lump sum cash severance payment and the value of the vested stock options  which constitutes the entire expense related to these options  and no future period charges will be required 
this  was allocated in the table above in equal portions among three departmental categories  consistent with previous allocations of the former coo s compensation expense 
the future 
we will continue to grant options which will result in an expense to our employees and  as appropriate  to non employee service providers 
in addition  previously granted options will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to non vested stock options not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately  these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the fair value of this option was re measured at the end of each quarter  using the black scholes option pricing model  with the movement in fair value reported in the statement of operations as a change in fair value of option liabilities 
this option expired unexercised on december  in reference to the joint venture  the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to us at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
the value of the put has been classified as a liability 
the valuations of the put were completed using an option pricing theory based simulation analysis ie  a monte carlo simulation 
the valuations are based on assumptions as of the valuation date with regard to the market value of cytori and the estimated fair value of the joint venture  the expected correlation between the values of cytori and the joint venture  the expected volatility of cytori and the joint venture  the bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori  the bankruptcy threshold for cytori  the probability of a change of control event for cytori  and the risk free interest rate

we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
over the next two to three years  the joint venture is expected to incur labor costs related to the development of our second generation commercial system as well as general and administrative expenses  offset by royalty income expected to begin in when cytori commercializes its celution crs in europe and celution based stemsource cell bank in japan

additionally  the company believes that without additional capital from operations and other accessible sources of financing it does not currently have adequate funding to complete the development  preclinical activities and clinical trials required to bring its future products to market  therefore  it will require significant additional funding 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to raise additional funds through accessible sources of financing  strategic relationships or through revenue sources  it will be required to significantly reduce or curtail its research and development activities and other operations 
management actively monitors cash expenditures and projected expenditures as we progress toward our goals of product commercialization and sales in an effort to match projected expenditures to available cash flow

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
while our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made  our actual results may differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
if results differ materially from our estimates  we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment 
we believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies 
these are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and  as a result  could have the greatest impact on our future financial results 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from a number of different sources  including but not limited to fees for achieving certain defined milestones under research and or development arrangements 
product sales  and payments under license or distribution agreements 
a number of our revenue generating arrangements are relatively simple in nature  meaning that there is little judgment necessary with regard to the timing of when we recognize revenues or how such revenues are presented in the financial statements 
however  we have also entered into more complex arrangements  including but not limited to our contracts with olympus  senko  and the nih 
moreover  some of our non recurring transactions  such as our disposition of the majority of our thin film business to mast  contain elements that relate to our revenue producing activities 
as a result  some of our most critical accounting judgments relate to the identification  timing  and presentation of revenue related activities 
these critical judgments are as follows multiple element arrangements some of our revenue generating arrangements contains a number of distinct revenue streams  known as elements 
for example  our distribution agreement with senko contains direct or indirect future revenue streams related to a distribution license fee which was paid at the outset of the arrangement  milestone payments for achieving commercialization of the thin film product line in japan  training for representatives of senko  sales of thin film products to senko  and payments in the nature of royalties on future product sales made by senko to its end customers 
emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  governs whether each of the above elements in the arrangement should be accounted for individually  or whether the entire contract should be treated as a single unit of accounting 
eitf indicates that individual elements may be separately accounted for only when the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective evidence of the fair value of the remaining undelivered elements  and if the arrangement contains a general right of return related to any products delivered  delivery of the remaining goods and services is probable and within the complete control of the seller 
in the case of the senko distribution agreement  we determined that a the milestones payments for achieving commercialization and b the future sale of thin film products to senko were separable elements 
that is  each of these elements  upon delivery  will have stand alone value to senko and there will be objective evidence of the fair value of any remaining undelivered elements at that time 
the arrangement does not contain any general right of return  and so this point is not relevant to our analysis 
on the other hand  we concluded that a the upfront distribution license fee  b the revenues from training for representatives of senko  and c the payments in the form of royalties on future product sales are not separable elements under eitf in arriving at our conclusions  we had to consider whether our customer  senko  would receive stand alone value from each delivered element 
we also  in some cases  had to look to third party evidence to support the fair value of certain undelivered elements 
finally  we had to make assumptions about how the non separable elements of the arrangement are earned  particularly the estimated period over which senko will benefit from the arrangement refer to the recognition discussion below for further background 
we also agreed to perform elements under the november  agreements we signed with olympus  including granting the joint venture which olympus is considered to control an exclusive and perpetual manufacturing license to our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  and completing certain pre clinical and clinical studies  assisting with product development and seeking regulatory approval and or clearances toward commercialization of the celution system platform 
we concluded that the license and development services must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in reaching this conclusion  we determined that the license would not have stand alone value to the joint venture 
this is because cytori is the only party that could be reasonably expected to perform certain development contributions and obligations  including product development assistance  certain agreed regulatory filings and generally associated pre clinical and clinical studies necessary for the joint venture to derive value from the license 
recognition besides determining whether to account separately for components of a multiple element arrangement  we also use judgment in determining the appropriate accounting period in which to recognize revenues that we believe a have been earned and b are realizable 
the following describes some of the recognition issues we have considered during the reporting period 
upfront license fees milestones o as part of the senko distribution agreement  we received an upfront license fee upon execution of the arrangement  which  as noted previously  was not separable under eitf accordingly  the license has been combined with the development milestones element to form a single accounting unit 
this single element of  in fees includes  which is potentially refundable 
we have recognized  and will continue to recognize  the non contingent fees allocated to this combined element as revenues as we complete each of the performance obligations associated with the milestones component of this combined deliverable 
note that the timing of when we have recognized revenues to date does not correspond with the cash we received upon achieving certain milestones 
for example  the first such milestone payment for  became payable to us when we filed a commercialization application with the japanese regulatory authorities 
however  we determined that the payment received was not commensurate with the level of effort expended  particularly when compared with other steps we believe are necessary to commercialize the thin film product line in japan 
accordingly  we did not recognize the entire  received as revenues  but instead all but  of this amount is classified as deferred revenues 
approximately   in   in   in and  in has been recognized to date as development revenues based on our estimates of the level of effort expended for completed milestones as compared with the total level of effort we expect to incur under the arrangement to successfully achieve regulatory approval of the thin film product line in japan 
these estimates were subject to judgment and there may be changes to these estimates as we continue to seek regulatory approval 
in fact there can be no assurance that commercialization in japan will ever be achieved  as we have yet to receive approval from the mhlw 
o we also received upfront fees as part of the olympus arrangements although  unlike in the senko agreement  these fees were non refundable 
specifically  in exchange for an upfront fee  we granted the joint venture an exclusive  perpetual license to certain of our intellectual property and agreed to perform additional development activities 
this upfront fee has been recorded in the liability account entitled deferred revenues  related party  on our consolidated balance sheet 
similar to the senko agreement  we expect to recognize revenues from the combined license development accounting unit as we perform our obligations under the agreements  as this represents our final obligation underlying the combined accounting unit 
specifically  we have recognized revenues from the license development accounting unit using a proportional performance methodology  resulting in the de recognition of amounts recorded in the deferred revenues  related party  account as we complete various milestones underlying the development services 
proportional performance methodology was elected due to the nature of our development obligations and efforts in support of the joint venture jv  including product development activities  and regulatory efforts to support the commercialization of the jv products 
the application of this methodology uses the achievement of r d milestones as outputs of value to the jv 
we received up front  non refundable payments in connection with these development obligations  which we have broken down into specific r d milestones that are definable and substantive in nature  and which will result in value to the jv when achieved 
revenue will be recognized as the above mentioned r d milestones are completed 
we established the r d milestones based upon our development obligations to the jv and the specific r d support activities to be performed to achieve these obligations 
our r d milestones consist of the following primary performance categories product development  regulatory approvals  and generally associated pre clinical and clinical trials 
within each category are milestones that take substantive effort to complete and are critical pieces of the overall progress towards completion of the next generation product  which we are obligated to support within the agreements entered into with olympus 
to determine whether substantive effort was required to achieve the milestones  we considered the external costs  required personnel and relevant skill levels  the amount of time required to complete each milestone  and the interdependent relationships between the milestones  in that the benefits associated with the completion of one milestone generally support and contribute to the achievement of the next 
determination of the relative values assigned to each milestone involved substantial judgment 
the assignment process was based on discussions with persons responsible for the development process and the relative costs of completing each milestone 
we considered the costs of completing the milestones in allocating the portion of the deferred revenues  related party account balance to each milestone 
management believes that  while the costs incurred in achieving the various milestones are subject to estimation  due to the high correlation of such costs to outputs achieved  the use of external contract research organization cro costs and internal labor costs as the basis for the allocation process provides management the ability to accurately and reasonably estimate such costs 
the accounting policy described above could result in revenues being recorded in an earlier accounting period than had other judgments or assumptions been made by us 
government grants o we are eligible to receive grants from the nih related to our research on adipose derived cell therapy to treat myocardial infarctions 
revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants are recorded in compliance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in accordance with the criteria established by these eitf issues  the company records grant revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  research arrangements we have with nih  as well commercial enterprises such as olympus and senko  are considered a key component of our central and ongoing operations 
moreover  the government obtains rights under the arrangement  in the same manner but perhaps not to the same extent as a commercial customer that similarly contracts with us to perform research activities 
for instance  the government and any authorized third parties may use our federally funded research and or inventions without payment of royalties to us 
accordingly  the inflows from such arrangements are presented as revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
our policy was to recognize revenues under the nih grant arrangement as the lesser of i qualifying costs incurred and not previously recognized  plus our allowable grant fees for which we are entitled to funding or ii the amount determined by comparing the outputs generated to date versus the total outputs expected to be achieved under the research arrangement 
goodwill impairment testing in late  we purchased stemsource  inc and recognized over  in goodwill associated with the acquisition  of which  remains on our balance sheet as of december  as required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we must test this goodwill at least annually for impairment as well as when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
moreover  this testing must be performed at a level of the organization known as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is at least the same level as a company s operating segments  and sometimes even one level lower 
our two reporting units are  same as  our two operating segments 
specifically  the process for testing goodwill for impairment under sfas involves the following steps company assets and liabilities  including goodwill  are allocated to each reporting unit for purposes of completing the goodwill impairment test 
the carrying value of each reporting unit that is  the sum of all of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit is then compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill may be impaired additional testing is required 
the application of the goodwill impairment test involves a substantial amount of judgment 
for instance  sfas requires that assets and liabilities be assigned to a reporting unit if both of the following criteria are met the asset will be employed in or the liability relates to the operations of a reporting unit 
the asset or liability will be considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we developed mechanisms to assign company wide assets like shared property and equipment  as well as company wide obligations such as borrowings under our ge loan facility  to our two reporting units 
in some cases  certain assets were not allocable to either reporting unit and were left unassigned 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting units by using various estimation techniques 
for example in  we estimated the fair value of our macropore biosurgery reporting unit based on an equal weighting of the market values of comparable enterprises and discounted projections of estimated future cash flows 
clearly  identifying comparable companies and estimating future cash flows as well as appropriate discount rates involve judgment 
on the contrary  we estimated the fair value of our regenerative cell reporting unit solely using an income approach  as at that time we believed there were no comparable enterprises on which to base a valuation 
the assumptions underlying this valuation method involve a substantial amount of judgment  particularly since our regenerative cell business has yet to generate any revenues and does not have a commercially viable product 
the combined value of our goodwill is consistent with the market s valuation 
in  all goodwill that previously had been assigned to our macropore biosurgery reporting unit was derecognized as a result of our sale of our spine and orthopedic product line to kensey nash 
accordingly  there was no need to test this component of our business for goodwill impairment in also in  we completed our goodwill impairment testing for our regenerative cell technology reporting unit using a market based approach 
we concluded that the fair value of this unit exceeded its carrying value  and that none of our reported goodwill was impaired 
again  the manner in which we assigned assets  liabilities  and goodwill to our reporting units  as well as how we determined the fair value of such reporting units  involves significant uncertainties and estimates 
the judgments employed may have an effect on whether a goodwill impairment loss is recognized 
variable interest entity olympus cytori joint venture fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether an entity is a vie and determining its primary beneficiary involves significant judgment 
we concluded that the olympus cytori joint venture was a vie based on the following factors under fin r  an entity is a vie if it has insufficient equity to finance its activities 
we recognized that the initial cash contributed to the joint venture formed by olympus and cytori  would be completely utilized by the first quarter of moreover  it was highly unlikely that the joint venture would be able to obtain the necessary financing from third party lenders without additional subordinated financial support such as personal guarantees by one or both of the joint venture stockholders 
accordingly  the joint venture will require additional financial support from olympus and cytori to finance its ongoing operations  indicating that the joint venture is a vie 
in fact  we contributed  and  in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  to fund the joint venture s ongoing operations 
moreover  olympus has a contingent put option that would  in specified circumstances  require cytori to purchase olympus s interests in the joint venture for a fixed amount of  accordingly  olympus is protected in some circumstances from absorbing all expected losses in the joint venture 
under fin r  this means that olympus may not be an at risk equity holder  although olympus clearly has decision rights over the operations of the joint venture 
because the joint venture is undercapitalized  and because one of the joint venture s decision makers may be protected from losses  we have determined that the joint venture is a vie under fin r 
as noted previously  a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is defined in fin r as the entity that would absorb the majority of the vie s expected losses or be entitled to receive the majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
significant judgment was involved in determining the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
under fin r  we believe that olympus and cytori are de facto agents and  together  will absorb more than of the joint venture s expected losses and residual returns 
ultimately  we concluded that olympus  and not cytori  was the party most closely related with the joint venture and  hence  its primary beneficiary 
our conclusion was based on the following factors the business operations of the joint venture will be most closely aligned to those of olympus ie  the manufacture of devices 
olympus controls the board of directors  as well as the day to day operations of the joint venture 
the application of fin r involves substantial judgment 
had we consolidated the joint venture  though  there would be no effect on our net loss or shareholders equity at december  or for the year then ended 
however  certain balance sheet and income statement captions would have been presented in a different manner 
for instance  we would not have presented a single line item entitled investment in joint venture in our balance sheet but  instead  would have performed a line by line consolidation of each of the joint venture s accounts into our financial statements 
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december  to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
we increased our valuation allowance by approximately  during the year ended december  the valuation allowance includes approximately  related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which  if realized  will eventually be credited to equity and not to income 
at december   we had federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and respectively  if unused 
at december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal credits will begin to expire in  if unused  and  of the state credits will begin to expire in if unused 
the remaining state credits carry forward indefinitely 
in addition  we had a foreign tax loss carryforward of  and  in japan and the united kingdom  respectively 
the internal revenue code limits the future availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation s ownership resulting in a change of control of cytori 
due to prior ownership changes as defined in irc section  a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are limited in their annual utilization

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments  including funds classified as cash equivalents 
investment securities are subject to market rate risk as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from the levels prevailing at december   for example  and assuming average investment duration of seven months  the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce such risks by generally limiting the maturity date of such securities  diversifying our investments and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
while we do not always have the intent  we do currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  believe that reductions in the value of such securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in interest rates would  of course  affect the interest income we earn on our cash balances after re investment 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our activities in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under our japanese thin film agreement with senko  we would receive payments in the nature of royalties based on senko s net sales  which would be yen denominated
