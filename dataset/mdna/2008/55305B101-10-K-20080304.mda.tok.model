application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical to our financial condition and results of operations and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed  and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  home closings financed by third parties and all home closings insured under fha or va government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our wholly owned subsidiary  m i financial corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized interest  real estate taxes  indirect costs  and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
sales incentives  including pricing discounts and financing costs paid by the company  are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives in the form of options or upgrades are recorded in homebuilding costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we defer the application and origination fees  net of costs  and recognize them as revenue  along with the associated gains or losses on the sale of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans sfas 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the fair value of the guarantee is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered  and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with land acquisition and development  and home construction 
inventories are recorded at cost  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land may be impaired 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventories include capitalized interest  real estate taxes  and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimate by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from the estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
the company assesses inventories for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in conducting our quarterly review for indicators of impairment on a community level  we evaluate  among other things  the margins on homes that have been delivered  margins on sales contracts in backlog  projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community  projected margins with regard to future land sales  and the value of the land itself 
we pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward 
from this review  we identify communities whose carrying values may exceed their undiscounted cash flows 
operating communities 
for existing operating communities  the recoverability of assets is measured on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales 
these estimated cash flows are developed based primarily on management s assumptions relating to the community 
the significant assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of assets include the timing of development and or marketing phases  projected sales price and sales pace of each existing or planned community  the estimated land development  home construction and selling costs of the community  overall market supply and demand  the local market and competitive conditions 
management reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
future communities 
for raw land or land under development that management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities  the recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales  consistent with the evaluations performed for operating communities discussed above 
for raw land  land under development or lots that management intends to market for sale to a third party  but that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as land held for sale as discussed below  the recoverability of the assets is determined based on either the estimated net sales proceeds expected to be realized on the sale of the assets or the estimated fair value determined using cash flow valuation techniques 
if the company has not yet determined whether raw land or land under development will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or marketed for sale to a third party  the company assesses the recoverability of the inventory using a probability weighted approach  in accordance with sfas land held for sale 
land held for sale includes land that meets all of the following six criteria defined in sfas management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated  the sale of the asset is probable  and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
in accordance with sfas  the company records land held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions  market analysis and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  as well as actual contracts 
if the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
for all of the above categories  the key assumptions relating to the valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
local market specific factors that may impact our project assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales rates  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors local market and or community presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other local market specific conditions that may be present are considered by personnel in our homebuilding divisions as they prepare or update the forecasted assumptions for each community 
quantitative and qualitative factors other than home sales prices could significantly impact the potential for future impairments 
the sales objectives can differ between communities  even within a given sub market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
furthermore  the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in home sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace  selling strategies  or discount rates could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful 
as of december   our projections generally assume a gradual improvement in market conditions over time  along with a gradual increase in costs 
these gradual increases begin in either or  depending on the market 
if communities are not recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of a community is determined by discounting management s cash flow projections using an appropriate risk adjusted interest rate 
as of december   we utilized discount rates ranging from to in the above valuations 
the discount rate used in determining each asset s fair value depends on the community s projected life  development stage  and the inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flow stream 
for example  construction in progress inventory which is closer to completion will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development 
we believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community 
a higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community  while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates 
however  if homebuilding market conditions and our operating results change  or if the current challenging market conditions continue for an extended period  future results could differ materially from management s judgments and estimates 
consolidated inventory not owned 
we enter into land option agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we typically provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at pre determined prices 
if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity  the company s deposit including letters of credit represents a variable interest in the entity  and we must use our judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include the amount of the deposit in relation to the fair value of the land  the expected timing of our purchase of the land  and assumptions about projected cash flows 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
we also periodically enter into lot option arrangements with third parties to whom we have sold our raw land inventory 
we evaluate these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for product financing arrangements  to determine if we should record an asset and liability at the time we sell the land and enter into the lot option contract 
investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies 
we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for distribution to us in connection with our homebuilding operations 
in our judgment  we have determined that these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities because they have sufficient equity to finance their operations 
we must use our judgment to determine if we have substantive control over these entities 
if we were to determine that we have substantive control over an entity  we would be required to consolidate the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have substantive control or exercise significant influence over an entity include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions  and continuing involvement 
in the event an entity does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations  we would be required to use judgment to determine if we were the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have substantive control or exercise significant influenceover an entity to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
based on the application of our accounting policies  these entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of investments in common stock  and sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company evaluates its investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies llcs for potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the investment s carrying value and the company has determined that the decline in value is other than temporary  the company would write down the value of the investment to fair value 
the determination of whether an investment s fair value is less than the carrying value requires management to make certain assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future contributions to the limited liability company  the timing of distribution of lots to the company from the limited liability company  the projected fair value of the lots at the time of distribution to the company  and the estimated proceeds from  and timing of  the sale of land or lots to third parties 
in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs  the company evaluates the projected cash flows associated with the llc using a probability weighted approach based on the likelihood of different outcomes 
as of december   the company used a discount rate of in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs 
in addition to the assumptions management must make to determine if the investment s fair value is less than the carrying value  management must also use judgment in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the factors management considers are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the limited liability company for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in situations where the investments are equity financed by the partners  and the joint venture simply distributes lots to its partners  the company evaluates other than temporary by preparing an undiscounted cash flow model as described in inventories above for operating communities 
if such model results in positive value versus carrying value  the company determines that the impairment is temporary  otherwise  the company determines that the impairment is other than temporary and impairs the investment 
because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions  it is possible that the company may determine the investment is not impaired in the current period but  due to passage of time or change in market conditions leading to changes in assumptions  impairment could occur 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable income statement or balance sheet line  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guarantee on loans sold to certain third parties and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including environmental indemnifications  guarantees of the completion of land development  a loan maintenance and limited payment guaranty and minimum net worth guarantees of certain subsidiaries 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guarantees and indemnifications could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty accruals are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty accrual for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor required under the company s warranty programs 
accruals are recorded for warranties under the following warranty programs home builder s limited warranty new warranty program which became effective for homes closed starting with the third quarter of  year transferable structural warranty effective for homes closed after april   two year limited warranty program effective prior to the implementationo f the home builder s limited warranty  and year transferable structural warranty effective for homes closed between september  and april  the warranty accruals for the home builder s limited warranty and two year limited warranty program are established as a percentage of average sales price  and the structural warranty accruals are established on a per unit basis 
our warranty accruals are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the accruals include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures included in the above not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates which reflect both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty accrual balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  ohio workers compensation and general liability insurance 
our self insurance limit for employee health care is  per claim per year for fiscal  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  up to  per claim per year 
our self insurance limit for workers compensation is  per claim with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open cases 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and million in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims and other industry specific factors 
the company has recorded expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield  and the expected term of the option 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
derivative financial instruments 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
these irlcs are considered derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these fmbss  options on fmbss and irlcs covered by fmbss are considered non designated derivatives 
in determining fair value of irlcs  m i financial considers the value of the resulting loan if sold in the secondary market 
that value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for along with the value of excess servicing 
neither servicing release premiums nor net normal servicing cash flows are included in determining the value 
this determines the initial fair value  which is indexed to zero at inception 
subsequent to inception  m i financial estimates an updated fair value which is compared to the initial fair value 
in addition  m i financial uses fallout estimates which fluctuate based on the rate of the irlc in relation to current rates 
in accordance with sfas and related derivatives implementation group conclusions  gains or losses are recorded in financial services revenue 
certain irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale are committed to third party investors through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
in accordance with sfas  the irlcs and related best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  which generally are highly effective from an economic standpoint  are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains or losses recorded in financial services revenue 
under the terms of these best efforts whole loan delivery commitments covering mortgage loans held for sale  the specific committed mortgage loans held for sale are identified and matched to specific delivery commitments on a loan by loan basis 
the delivery commitments are designated as fair value hedges of the mortgage loans held for sale  and both the delivery commitments and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in financial services revenue 
income taxes valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of a company s net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset  and existing backlog that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures 
examples of negative evidence may include the existence of cumulative losses defined as a pre tax cumulative loss for the business cycle in our case four years  an expectation of being in a cumulative loss position in a future reporting period  a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits  a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwads expiring unused  and unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorable resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
a company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
at december   after considering a number of factors  most notably our strong earnings history  we did not establish a valuation allowance except for  related to the phase out of income taxes in the state of ohio 
future adjustments to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of our net deferred tax assets 
for example  the valuation allowance could change significantly if the million of net deferred tax assets remaining at december  is not realized during fiscal through federal or state carryback or reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
this could occur if actual levels of home closings and or land sales during are less than currently projected 
additionally  our determination with respect to recording a valuation allowance may be further impacted by  among other things additional inventory impairments  additional pre tax operating losses  or the utlization of tax planning strategies that could accelerate the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
because a valuation allowance can be impacted by any one or a combination of the foregoing factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a meaningful sensitivity analysis associated with potential adjustments to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
additionally  due to the considerable estimates utilized in establishing a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to either increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
income taxes fin the company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in tax returns  and records the associated tax benefit or liability in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
interest and penalties for all uncertain tax positions are recorded within benefit provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations in conformity with sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the company s chief operating decision makers evaluate the company s performance in various ways  including the results of our ten individual homebuilding operating segments and the results of the financial services operation  the results of our three homebuilding regions  and our consolidated financial results 
we have determined our reportable segments in accordance with sfas as follows midwest homebuilding  florida homebuilding  mid atlantic homebuilding and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operating segments that are included within each reportable segment have similar operations and exhibit similar economic characteristics  and therefore meet the aggregation criteria in sfas our homebuilding operations include the acquisition and development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes  and the occasional sale of lots and land to third parties 
the homebuilding operating segments that comprise each of our reportable segments are as follows midwest florida mid atlantic columbus  ohio tampa  florida maryland cincinnati  ohio orlando  florida virginia indianapolis  indiana charlotte  north carolina chicago  illinois raleigh  north carolina the company announced its entry into the chicago market during the second quarter of  and has not purchased any land or sold or closed any homes in this market as of december  in december  we sold substantially all of our assets in our west palm beach  florida market and announced our exit from this market 
the results of operations for this segment for all years presented have been reclassified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas are not included in this segment 
the financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title and insurance agency services for purchasers of the company s homes 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  overview the housing market continued to deteriorate throughout consumer confidence in housing declined  while the mortgage market began to experience a severe tightening  reducing financing availability  which in turn exacerbated existing conditions  lowering demand and new contracts 
the overall market became more and more competitive as the year progressed  and we experienced a great deal of downward pricing through the use of incentives  price reductions and incentivized brokerage fees 
excess inventory of new and existing homes and weakening demand continue to impact us in virtually all of our markets 
all of these factors have led to further price competition and margin compression in all of our markets 
as a result of these conditions  we incurred impairment charges related to both inventory and investments on continuing operations of million 
these charges by region were as follows midwest million  florida million and mid atlantic million 
we also incurred an additional million of inventory impairments in west palm beach  florida  a market we exited in december and are treating as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition to these impairment charges  we wrote off million related to abandoned land transactions and million of intangible assets  and incurred million of severance costs 
however  in the midst of these unprecedented industry conditions  we believe we have made progress on a number of fronts during the year to better position us for the future we reduced our owned inventory position by  generating cash from land sales of million and net cash from operations of million 
as a result of our land sales  we were able to monetize the loss on sale using carry backs for federal income tax purposes and received a million tax refund in the first quarter of we completed a million preferred share offering in s first quarter  which we believe improves our overall capital structure 
as a result of the first two actions  our homebuilding net debt to capital ratio now stands at versus a year ago 
we plan to further reduce our inventory of owned lots with additional land sales  and limit land and lot purchases and land development spending 
we expect to generate positive cash flow during and completely pay off the debt under our homebuilding credit facility by the end of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes is not due until we reduced  and continue to reduce overhead  in an effort to be right sized for anticipated lower volume levels 
while it has been challenging to stay ahead of rapidly adjusting market conditions and resulting revenue reductions  we have reduced our workforce to date by over from our peak in early key financial results for the year ended december   total revenue decreased million from due to a decrease in housing revenue from billion to million 
the decrease in housing revenue was due to a decrease in homes delivered to  in from  in and a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered of  from  in to  in revenue from the sale of land to outside parties increased million from million in to million in our financial services revenue decreased from million in to million in due to a decrease in loan originations  from  in to  in we currently estimate homes delivered to be approximately  with regional breakdown of in the midwest  in florida and in the mid atlantic region 
for the years ended december  and  our gross margin percentages were and  respectively 
excluding impairment charges referred to above and impairment charges  our gross margin percentages for and were and  respectively 
gross margin percentage excluding impairment charges is a non gaap financial measure disclosed by certain of our competitors and has been presented by us because we find it useful in evaluating our operating performance and believe that it helps readers of our financial statements compare our operations with those of our competitors 
income before taxes decreased million  from income of million in to a loss of million in the decrease was driven by the million of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs in certain of our markets 
partially offsetting the decrease in income before taxes was the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million largely driven by a reduction of payroll due to reduced headcount  and a decrease in selling expenses of million due to a reduction in variable selling expenses sales commissions and realtor commissions and advertising expenses as a result of volume declines 
new contracts for were down  from  in to  in as a result of deteriorating market conditions  all of our regions experienced reduced traffic levels  weaker demand  an over supply of inventory and significant competitor discounting 
despite the current conditions  we saw a decrease in our cancellation rate  which was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in as a result of the continued softened market conditions and oversupply of inventory  we experienced an decrease in new contracts in our florida region and a decline in new contracts in our midwest region 
our mid atlantic region new contracts increased due primarily to sales results in our raleigh and washington  dc markets 
as a result of lower refinance volume for outside lenders and increased competition  during we expect to experience continued pressure on our mortgage company s capture rate  which was approximately during and during this could continue to negatively impact earnings 
as discussed above  we are experiencing changes in market conditions that require us to constantly monitor the value of our inventories and investments in unconsolidated llcs in those markets in which we operate  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of charges relating to the impairment of inventory and investment in unconsolidated llcs and million of inventory impairment on our discontinued operation 
we generally believe that we will see a gradual improvement in market conditions beginning in during  we will continue to update our evaluation of the value of our inventories and investments for impairment  and could be required to record additional impairment charges  which would negatively impact earnings  should market conditions deteriorate further or results differ from management s assumptions 
our effective income tax rate for was  compared to for the increase in the effective rate is primarily due to the impact of losing the section deduction taken in previous years that is now disallowed as a result of our loss position and our carryback to those years

seasonality and variability in quarterly results we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
we also have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in our financial services operations  because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations

the reduction in rate reflects differences in the location of state taxable income  clarification of the amount of manufacturing credit available under the american job creation act of  and the change in the state of ohio income tax from one that is income based to one that is based on gross receipts  the recording of which is classified as general and administrative expense

liquidity and capital resources operating cash flow activities during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from our operating activities  as compared to using million of cash in such activities during the net cash generated during was primarily a result of the million net conversion of inventory into cash as a result of home closings as well as land sales  which generated million of cash during versus million in  partially offset by million of land purchases and approximately million of land development costs 
also contributing to cash provided by operating activities was a million decrease in cash held in escrow resulting from fewer escrowed closings at the end of when compared to the end of the principal reason for the generation of cash from operations during compared to our use of cash during was our defensive strategy to reduce our land purchases to better match our forecasted number of home sales driven by challenging market conditions

we fund these operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities  which are primarily unsecured  and  from time to time  issuances of new debt and or equity securities  as management deems necessary 
as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations  we constantly focus on the impact on our balance sheet 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness  and may incur substantial indebtedness in the future  to fund our homebuilding activities

c the company is party to land purchase option agreements to acquire developed lots from sellers who are variable interest entities 
the company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities  and therefore is required under financial accounting standards board interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities to consolidate the entities 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to consolidation of these variable interest entities 
the actual cash payments that the company will make in the future will be based upon the number of lots acquired each period under the option agreements and the related per lot prices in effect at that time 
one of the land purchase option agreements has specific performance provisions 
we are required to purchase million of land in the future  but at this time cannot accurately specify the time period 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this obligation 
d the amount reported herein of million represents principal and interest for a bond obligation incurred in connection with the acquisition of lots in a community in florida 
this obligation will be repaid as the company closes on the lots in this community to third parties 
the estimated payments by period above have been estimated based on the expected timing of closings 
in addition  in connection with the development of certain of the company s communities  local government entities have been established and bonds have been issued by those entities to finance a portion of the related infrastructure 
these community development district obligations represent obligations of the company as the current holder of the property  net of cash held by the district available to offset the particular bond obligations 
as of december   the company has recorded a liability of million relating to these community development district obligations 
however  the actual cash payments that the company will ultimately make will be dependent upon the timing of the sale of those lots within the district to third parties 
because we are unable to estimate the timing of such sales  the amounts have not been included above 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
e the company has obligations with certain subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitment to deliver homes with an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin of  exclusive of impairment charges  plus variable selling costs of of revenue  less costs already incurred on homes in backlog  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
f the company has options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
purchase of properties is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the company and the sellers and therefore the timing of payments under these agreements is not determinable 
the company has no specific performance obligations with respect to these agreements 
g we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions 
as of december   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  million of related accrued interest and million of related accrued penalties 
we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finlizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months 
however  the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable 
the statue of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination of tax years through off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land  and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of llcs  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing in the form of a capital distribution developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities vies  because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors  however  we must evaluate each entity to determine whether it is or is not a vie 
if an entity was determined to be a vie  we would then evaluate whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
these evaluations are initially performed when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
we have determined that none of the llcs in which we have an interest are vies  and we also have determined that we do not have substantive control over any of these entities  therefore  our homebuilding llcs are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million  plus letters of credit and bonds totaling million that serve as completion bonds for the development work in progress and our possible future obligations under guarantees and indemnifications provided in connection with these entities as further discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under the option agreement often meet the criteria for vies  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to these agreements is equal to the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including cash deposits of million  prepaid acquisition costs of million  letters of credit of million and corporate promissory notes of million

interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions of the united states of america and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates and inflation 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased interest rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
toward the end of  interest rates began to decline 
as interest rates decline  homebuyers are more likely to obtain or qualify for mortgages that are acceptable to them  which in turn would make them more likely to purchase homes 
during the past year  we have experienced some detrimental effect from inflation  particularly the inflation in the cost of land that occurred over the past several years 
as a result of declines in market conditions in most of our markets  in certain communities  we have been unable to recover the cost of these higher land prices  resulting in lower gross margins and significant charges being recorded in our operating results due to the impairment of inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs and other write offs relating to deposits and pre acquisition costs of abandoned land transactions 
in recent years  we have not experienced a detrimental effect from inflation in relation to our home construction costs  and we have been successful in the current year in reducing certain of these costs with our subcontractors 
however  unanticipated construction costs or a change in market conditions may occur during the period between the date sales contracts are entered into with customers and the delivery date of the related homes  resulting in lower gross profit margins
