we utilized our existing cash and proceeds from a new  senior secured credit facility to finance the acquisitions 
see liquidity and capital resources for discussion of the credit facility 
seasonality demand for our staffing services historically has been lower during the first and fourth quarters due to fewer business days resulting from client shutdowns and a decline in the number of contract professionals willing to work during the holidays 
this may have particular impact in because of the number of holidays that occur during the normal work week 
as is common in the staffing industry  we run special incentive programs to keep our contract professionals  particularly nurses  working through the holidays 
demand for our staffing services usually increases in the second and third quarters of the year 
in addition  our cost of services typically increases in the first quarter primarily due to the reset of payroll taxes
