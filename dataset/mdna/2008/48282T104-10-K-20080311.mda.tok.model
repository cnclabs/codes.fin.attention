table of contents kadant inc annual report raw materials raw materials  components  and supplies for our significant products are available either from a number of different suppliers or from alternative sources that we believe could be developed without a material adverse effect on our business 
the raw material used in the manufacture of our fiber based granules is obtained from three paper recycling mills 
the mills have the exclusive right to supply papermaking byproducts to our existing granulation plant in green bay  wisconsin  under contracts which expire in december and are renewable every two years by mutual agreement 
although we believe that our relationships with the mills are good  the mills may not agree to renew the contracts upon their expiration 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulty in obtaining sufficient raw material to operate at optimal production levels 
we continue to work with the mills to ensure a stable supply of raw material 
to date  we have been able to meet all of our customer delivery requirements  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future delivery requirements 
if the mills were unable or unwilling to supply us sufficient fiber  we would be forced to find an alternative supplier for this raw material 
patents  licenses  and trademarks we protect our intellectual property rights by applying for and obtaining patents when appropriate 
we also rely on technical know how  trade secrets  and trademarks to maintain our competitive position

other businesses we currently hold several us patents  expiring on various dates ranging from to  related to various aspects of the processing of fiber based granules and the use of these materials in the agricultural  professional turf  home lawn and garden  general absorption  oil and grease absorption  and catbox filler markets 
we also have foreign counterparts to certain of these us patents in canada 
seasonal influences papermaking systems there are no material seasonal influences on this segment s sales of products and services 
other businesses our fiber based granular products business experiences fluctuations in sales  usually in the third and fourth quarters  when sales decline due to the seasonality of the agricultural and home lawn and garden markets 
working capital requirements there are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital 

table of contents kadant inc annual report dependency on a single customer no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues or more than of the papermaking systems segment s revenues in any of the past three years 
revenues from china were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  representing of total revenues for each of and and for backlog our backlog of firm orders for the papermaking systems segment was million and million at year end and  respectively 
we anticipate that substantially all of the backlog at december  will be shipped or completed during the next months 
some of these orders can be canceled by the customer upon payment of a cancellation fee

item a 
risk factors in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we wish to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
our business is dependent on the condition of the pulp and paper industry 
we sell products primarily to the pulp and paper industry  which is a cyclical industry 
generally  the financial condition of the global pulp and paper industry corresponds to the condition of the general economy  as well as to a number of other factors  including pulp and paper production capacity relative to demand 
in recent years  the paper industry in certain geographic regions  notably europe and north america  has undergone a number of structural changes  including decreased spending  mill closures  consolidations  and bankruptcies  all of which have adversely affected our business 
in addition  paper producers have been and continue to be negatively affected by higher operating costs  especially higher energy and chemical costs 
we believe paper companies remain cautious about increasing their capital and operating spending in the current market environment 
as paper companies consolidate in response to market weakness  they frequently reduce capacity and postpone or even cancel capacity addition or expansion projects 
these actions can adversely affect our revenue and profitability globally or in a particular region or product line 

table of contents kadant inc annual report a significant portion of our international sales has  and may in the future  come from china and we operate several manufacturing facilities in china  which expose us to political  economic  operational and other risks 
we have significant revenues from china  operate significant facilities in china  and expect to manufacture and source more of our equipment and components from china in the future 
during and  approximately million and million  respectively  or of our total revenues in each year were from customers in china 
our manufacturing facilities in china  as well as the significant level of revenues from china  expose us to increased risk in the event of changes in the policies of the chinese government  political unrest  unstable economic conditions  or other developments in china or in us china relations that are adverse to trade  including enactment of protectionist legislation or trade or currency restrictions 
in addition  orders from customers in china  particularly for large stock preparation systems that have been tailored to a customer s specific requirements  have credit risks higher than we generally incur elsewhere  and some orders are subject to the receipt of financing approvals from the chinese government 
for this reason  we do not record signed contracts from customers in china for large stock preparation systems as orders until we receive the down payments for such contracts 
the timing of the receipt of these orders and the down payments are uncertain and there is no assurance that we will be able to recognize revenue on these contracts 
we may experience a loss if the contract is cancelled prior to the receipt of a down payment in the event we commence engineering or other work associated with the contract 
in addition  we may experience a loss if the contract is cancelled prior to the receipt of a letter of credit covering the remaining balance of the contract 
typically  the letter of credit represents or more of the total order 
our business is subject to economic  currency  political  and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
during and  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in china and europe 
in addition  we operate several manufacturing operations worldwide  including china  mexico  and brazil 
international revenues and operations are subject to a number of risks  including the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs  adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  impose currency restrictions or enact other protectionist or anti trade measures  it may be difficult to repatriate funds  due to unfavorable tax consequences or other restrictions or limitations imposed by foreign governments  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
although we seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in their local currencies 
in addition  our inability to repatriate funds could adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations 
any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
we are subject to intense competition in all our markets 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include quality  price  service  technical expertise  and product innovation 
our competitors include a number of large multinational corporations that may have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in 
table of contents kadant inc annual report customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products 
competitors technologies may prove to be superior to ours 
our current products  those under development  and our ability to develop new technologies may not be sufficient to enable us to compete effectively 
competition  especially in china  has increased as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand their product lines and manufacturing operations 
our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities 
in  we entered into a five year unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement in the aggregate principal amount of up to million  which includes an uncommitted unsecured incremental borrowing facility of up to an additional million 
we borrowed million under the credit agreement and we have also borrowed additional amounts under other agreements to fund acquisitions and grow our business 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
our indebtedness could have negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to pay dividends on or to repurchase our capital stock  limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing agreements  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete 
our existing indebtedness bears interest at floating rates and as a result  our interest payment obligations on our indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
to reduce the exposure to floating rates  million  or  of our outstanding floating rate debt as of february  was hedged through interest rate swap agreements 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive  and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures  seek additional financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt  or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
restrictions in our credit agreement may limit our activities 
our credit agreement contains  and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain  restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem  or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  create liens  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge  or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our credit agreement 
our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance  which is 
table of contents kadant inc annual report subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates  changes in technology  and changes in the level of competition 
our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under our credit agreement and other loan obligations  which could permit acceleration of the debt under those instruments and require us to repay the debt before its scheduled due date 
if an event of default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our debt agreements  those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under the agreements 
the inability of kadant composites llc to pay claims against it has exposed us to litigation  which if we are unable to successfully defend  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
on october   our kadant composites llc subsidiary composites llc sold substantially all of its assets to ldi composites co 
buyer for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities  resulting in a cumulative loss on sale of million 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  composites llc retained certain liabilities associated with the operation of the business prior to the sale  including warranty obligations related to products manufactured prior to the sale date retained liabilities  and  jointly and severally with its parent company kadant inc  agreed to indemnify the buyer against losses caused to the buyer arising from claims associated with the retained liabilities 
the indemnification obligation is contractually limited to approximately million 
all activity related to this business is classified in the results of the discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements 
composites llc retained all of the cash proceeds received from the asset sale and continued to administer and pay warranty claims from the sale proceeds into the third quarter of on september   composites llc announced that it no longer had sufficient funds to honor warranty claims  was unable to pay or process warranty claims  and ceased doing business 
we are now co defendants in a purported consumer class action  together with composites llc and another defendant  arising from these warranty claims 
in subsequent disclosures in this litigation  plaintiffs claim that such damages exceed million 
a judgment or a settlement of the claims against the defendants could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
for more information regarding our current litigation  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
there also can be no assurance that creditors or other claimants against composites llc will not seek other parties  including the company  against whom to assert claims 
while we believe any such asserted or possible claims against us or the buyer would be without merit the cost of litigation and the outcome  if we were unable to successfully defend such claims  could adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
an increase in the accrual for warranty costs of the discontinued operation adversely affects our consolidated financial results 
the discontinued operation has experienced significant liabilities associated with warranty claims related to its composite decking products manufactured prior to the sale date 
the accrued warranty costs of the discontinued operation are estimated based on the level of claims processed see discontinued operation in the overview section for a detailed description of the methodology used 
the accrued warranty costs of the discontinued operation as of december  represents the low end of the estimated range of warranty costs required based on the level of claims received through the end of composites llc has calculated that the total potential warranty cost ranges from million to approximately million 
the high end of the range represents the estimated maximum level of warranty claims remaining based on the total sales of the products under warranty 
on september   the discontinued operation ceased doing business and has no employees or other service providers to collect or process warranty claims 
composites llc will continue to record adjustments to accrued warranty costs to reflect the minimum amount of the potential range of loss for products under warranty based on judgments entered against it in litigation  which will adversely affect our consolidated results 

table of contents kadant inc annual report our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services 
our most recent acquisition was the kadant jining acquisition in june any such acquisition involves numerous risks that may adversely affect our future financial performance and cash flows 
these risks include competition with other prospective buyers resulting in our inability to complete an acquisition or in us paying substantial premiums over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business  inability to obtain regulatory approval  including antitrust approvals  difficulty in assimilating operations  technologies  products and the key employees of the acquired business  inability to maintain existing customers or to sell the products and services of the acquired business to our existing customers  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  inability to improve the revenues and profitability or realize the cost savings and synergies expected in the acquisition  assumption of significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time  potential future impairment of the value of goodwill and intangible assets acquired  and identification of internal control deficiencies of the acquired business 
we may be required to reorganize our operations in response to changing conditions in the paper industry  and such actions may require significant expenditures and may not be successful 
in the past  we have undertaken various restructuring measures in response to changing market conditions in the paper industry 
we may engage in additional cost reduction programs in the future 
we may not recoup the costs of programs we have already initiated  or other programs in which we may decide to engage in the future  the costs of which may be significant 
in connection with any future plant closures  delays or failures in the transition of production from existing facilities to our other facilities in other geographic regions could also adversely affect our financial operations 
in addition  our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs and position us to maintain or increase our sales 
our fiber based products business is subject to a number of factors that may adversely influence its profitability  including high costs of natural gas and dependence on a few suppliers of raw materials 
we use natural gas in the production of our fiber based granular products  the price of which is subject to fluctuation 
we seek to manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations by entering into short term forward contracts to purchase specified quantities of natural gas from a supplier 
we may not be able to effectively manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
higher costs of natural gas will adversely affect our consolidated results if we are unable to effectively manage our exposure or pass these costs on to customers in the form of surcharges 
we are dependent on three paper mills for the fiber used in the manufacture of our fiber based granular products 
these mills have the exclusive right to supply the papermaking byproducts used in the manufacturing process 
due to process changes at the mills  we have experienced some difficulty obtaining sufficient raw material to operate at optimal production levels 
we continue to work with the mills to ensure a stable supply of raw material 
to date  we have been able to meet all of our customer delivery requirements  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future delivery requirements 
although we believe our relationship with the mills is good  the mills could decide not to renew the contracts when they expire at the end of  or may not agree to renew on commercially reasonable terms 
if the mills were unable or unwilling to supply us sufficient fiber  we would be forced to find an alternative supply for this raw material 
we may be unable to find 
table of contents kadant inc annual report an alternative supply on commercially reasonable terms or could incur excessive transportation costs if an alternative supplier were found  which would increase our manufacturing costs  and might prevent prices for our products from being competitive or require closure of the business 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result 
we seek patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products  and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace 
we own numerous us and foreign patents  and we intend to file additional applications  as appropriate  for patents covering our products 
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us  and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market share 
we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us  including for alleged infringement of third party rights  or in suits in which we may assert our intellectual property rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  as our patents expire  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how to protect our products 
we cannot be sure the steps we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and intellectual property 
of particular concern are developing economies such as china  where the laws  courts  and administrative agencies may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in other countries 
we seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or our competitors may otherwise gain access to our intellectual property 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate and the impact of accounting standards related to revenue recognition  we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant selling  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect our operating results 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include failure of our products to pass contractually agreed upon acceptance tests  which would delay or prohibit recognition of revenues under sab no 
 changes in the assumptions used for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  failure of a customer  particularly in china  to comply with an order s contractual obligations  adverse changes in demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower sales prices of our products  adverse changes in the pulp and paper industry  delays or problems in our introduction of new products  delays or problems in the manufacture of our products  our competitors announcements of new products  services  or technological innovations  contractual liabilities incurred by us related to guarantees of our product performance  
table of contents kadant inc annual report increased costs of raw materials or supplies  including the cost of energy  changes in the timing of product orders  and fluctuations in our effective tax rate 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  under delaware law  and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  require supermajority shareholder voting to effect various amendments to our charter and bylaws  eliminate the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan intended to protect shareholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire our company and to provide our board of directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers 
preferred stock purchase rights have been distributed to our common shareholders pursuant to the rights plan 
this rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
the rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms that our board of directors does not believe are in our best interests and those of our shareholders and may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares

table of contents kadant inc annual report item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in the consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f of this report 
overview company overview we are a leading supplier of equipment used in the global papermaking and paper recycling industries and are also a manufacturer of granules made from papermaking byproducts 
our continuing operations are comprised of one reportable operating segment pulp and papermaking systems papermaking systems  and two product lines reported in other businesses  which include fiber based products and  prior to its sale in april  casting products 
through our papermaking systems segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking and paper recycling industries 
we have a large  stable customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
we believe our large installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business  and which should be less susceptible to the cyclical trends in the paper industry 
through our fiber based products line  we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf and ornamental applications  as well as for oil and grease absorption 
our casting products business manufactured grey and ductile iron castings until its sale on april  in addition  prior to its sale on october   we operated a composite building products business  which is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
international sales during and  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in china and europe 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial position depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents kadant inc annual report revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we enter into arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting pursuant to statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  were million in  million in  and million in the percentage of completion is determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirements 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations to take delivery of the equipment 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our actual results differed from our estimates  or if we were to use different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
under sab no 
 revenue recognition  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  revenues are recognized upon such acceptance 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements eg  installation  we consider the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
if equipment and installation do not meet the separation criteria under eitf no 
 revenues for products sold that require installation  for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality  and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon shipment  with estimated installation costs accrued 
we provide a reserve for the estimated warranty and installation costs at the time revenue is recognized  as applicable 
to the extent that installation becomes a significant component of our business in the future  the judgment associated with the determination of revenue recognition will increase 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of sab no 
affects the amounts reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
under sab no 
 we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on our customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 

table of contents kadant inc annual report we exercise judgment in determining our allowance for bad debts  which is based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical write offs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have in the past  especially in light of business conditions in the paper industry 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows in that period 
warranty obligations for continuing operations 
we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and their applications 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical occurrence rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in warranty occurrence rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
warranty obligations for discontinued operation 
on october   our kadant composites llc subsidiary composites llc sold substantially all of its assets to ldi composites co 
for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities  resulting in a cumulative loss on sale of million 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  composites llc retained certain liabilities associated with the operation of the business prior to the sale  including warranty obligations related to products manufactured prior to the sale date 
all activity related to this business is classified in the results of the discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
through the second quarter of  composites llc recorded an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on its actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates were revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
composites llc s analysis of expected warranty claims rates included detailed assumptions associated with potential product returns  including the type of product sold  temperatures at the location of installation  density of boards  and other factors 
certain assumptions  such as the effect of weather conditions and high temperatures on the product installed  included inherent uncertainties that contributed to variances between actual and expected claims rates 
during the third quarter of  composites llc concluded that the assumptions noted above were not accurately predicting the actual level of warranty claims  making it no longer possible to calculate a reasonable estimate of the future level of potential warranty claims 
accordingly  as no amount within the total range of loss represents a best estimate of the ultimate loss to be recorded  composites llc is required under sfas to record the minimum amount of the potential range of loss for products under warranty 
as of december   the accrued warranty costs associated with the composites business were million  which represent the low end of the range of potential loss for products under warranty based on the level of claims received through the end of composites llc has calculated that the potential warranty cost ranges from million to approximately million 
the high end of the range represents the estimated maximum level of warranty claims remaining based on the total sales of the products under warranty 

table of contents kadant inc annual report composites llc retained all of the cash proceeds received from the asset sale and continued to administer and pay warranty claims from the sale proceeds into the third quarter of on september   composites llc announced that it no longer had sufficient funds to honor warranty claims  was unable to pay or process warranty claims  and ceased doing business 
composites llc will continue to record adjustments to accrued warranty costs to reflect the minimum amount of the potential range of loss for products under warranty based on judgments entered against it in litigation 
stock based compensation 
we issue a variety of stock based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock unit awards  primarily to our key employees and directors 
compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which requires that we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of income  rather than disclose it in a pro forma footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we did not grant any stock options in and for options granted prior to january   we calculated the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we derived the estimated stock price volatility based on a review of our actual historic stock prices commensurate with the expected life of the award 
expected option life our estimate of an expected option life was derived based on a review of our historic option holding periods  including a consideration of the holding period inherent in currently vested  but unexercised options 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option 
risk free interest rate we used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
similar to the analysis for the expected option life  we reviewed historical forfeiture data and have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of december  we reevaluate this analysis quarterly and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  we will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not the tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  we would reverse the related valuation allowance 
our tax valuation allowance totaled million at year end should our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from our estimate  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
we provide a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
should tax return positions that we expect are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  we could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits be sustained  a reduction in our tax provision would result 
it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
at december   we believe that we have appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review 
table of contents kadant inc annual report inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for inventories at one of our us subsidiaries from the lower of cost  as determined by the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  or market to the lower of cost  as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting  or market 
we believe that this change is preferable because the change conforms to a single method of accounting for all our inventories  lifo inventory values have not been materially different than fifo inventory values for any reporting period  and the majority of our competitors use fifo 
had we used fifo instead of lifo for each reporting period for this us subsidiary since its acquisition in  the difference between the lifo and fifo valuation methods and their resulting effects on the consolidated financial statements  would not have been material for each such period 
as a result  we recorded the cumulative change from the lifo to the fifo method of accounting in the fourth quarter of derivatives 
we use derivative instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
when we enter into a derivative contract  we make a determination as to whether the transaction is deemed to be a hedge for accounting purposes 
for contracts deemed to be a hedge  we formally document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the risk being hedged 
in this documentation  we specifically identify the asset  liability  forecasted transaction  cash flow  or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item  and evaluate whether the derivative instrument is expected to reduce the risks associated with the hedged item 
to the extent these criteria are not met  we do not use hedge accounting for the derivative 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive items 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements are recognized in earnings in the period in which the exchange rates change and offset the currency gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
we perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the ineffective portion of a hedge  if any  and changes in the fair value of a derivative not deemed to be a hedge  are recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable rate debt and have designated these agreements as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest payments related to these obligations 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets for unrecognized gains and in other liabilities for unrecognized losses with an offset in accumulated other comprehensive items net of tax 
we use forward currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational cash flow hedges and balance sheet fair value hedges exposures resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
such exposures primarily result from portions of our operations and assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the businesses conducting the operations or holding the assets 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product sales and recorded accounts receivable made in the normal course of business  and accordingly  the hedges are not speculative in nature 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  
table of contents kadant inc annual report such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of using estimates from our long range forecasts 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
no adjustment was required in to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long range forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected based on current and anticipated cost structures 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist 
industry and business outlook our products are primarily sold to the global pulp and paper industry 
the paper industry in north america and europe has been in a prolonged down cycle for the past several years and has undergone important structural changes during that time 
in contrast  the paper industry in china has experienced strong growth over the last several years 
the performance of paper producers in north america and europe had generally improved over the past year 
however  paper producers in those regions continue to be negatively affected by higher operating costs  especially higher energy and chemical costs 
we believe paper companies are still cautious about increasing their capital and operating spending in the current market environment 
as the financial performance of paper companies has improved  they have increased their capital and operating spending  which has had a positive effect on paper company suppliers  including us 
we continue to concentrate our efforts on several initiatives intended to improve our operating results  including increasing sales of paper machine accessories and water management products in china  increasing our use of low cost manufacturing bases in china and mexico  penetrating new markets outside the paper industry  and increasing aftermarket sales  especially in china 
in addition  we continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs  capital expenditures  and working capital 
on may   we acquired all the outstanding stock of the johnson corporation kadant johnson  a leading supplier of fluid handling systems and equipment  including steam and condensate systems  components  and controls 
these products are used primarily in the dryer section of the papermaking process and in the production of corrugated boxboard  metals  plastics  rubber  textiles  and food 
kadant johnson was a privately held company based in three rivers  michigan  with approximately employees 
on june   kadant jining  assumed responsibility for the operation of huayi and  by september   acquired the assets of huayi  including cash  inventory  machinery  equipment  and buildings kadant jining acquisition 
huayi was a supplier of stock preparation equipment in china 
in the last several years  china has become a significant market for our stock preparation equipment 
a large percentage of the world s increases in paper production capacity are in china 
consequently  competition is intense and there is increasing pricing pressure particularly for large systems 
to capitalize on this growing market  we started manufacturing certain of our accessory and water management products in our china facilities in currently  our revenues from china are primarily derived from large capital orders  the timing of which is often difficult to predict 
at times  our customers in china have experienced delays in obtaining financing for their capital addition and expansion projects due to efforts by the chinese government to control economic growth  which are reflected in a slowdown in financing approvals in china s banking system 
these delays  as well as  delays in receiving down payments  could cause us to recognize revenue on these projects in periods later than originally anticipated 
we plan to use kadant jining as a base for increasing our aftermarket business  which we believe will be more predictable

we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we entered into receive variable and pay fixed swap agreements in and to hedge a portion of our variable rate long term debt 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward foreign exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates

the remaining unhedged portion of the debt totaling million and million as of year end and  respectively  is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of year end and  the interest rate on the unhedged portion of our us debt was based on libor and for our foreign debt based on rates established by the people s bank of china

the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses on forward foreign exchange contracts of million and million in and  respectively 
since we use forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
