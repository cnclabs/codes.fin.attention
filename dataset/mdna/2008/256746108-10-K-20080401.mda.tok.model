item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management s discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company  including what factors affect our business  what our net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were in  and  why those net sales  earnings  gross margins and costs were different from the year before  how all of this affects our overall financial condition  what our expenditures for capital projects were in and what we expect them to be in  and where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended february   february  and january  in management s discussion and analysis  we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year compared to the comparable fiscal year and the fiscal year compared to the comparable fiscal year key events and recent developments several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations 
you should keep in mind that on march   we reorganized by creating a new holding company structure 
the new parent company is dollar tree  inc  replacing dollar tree stores  inc  which is now an operating subsidiary 
outstanding shares of the capital stock of dollar tree stores  inc  were automatically converted  on a share for share basis  into identical shares of common stock of the new holding company 
the articles of incorporation  the bylaws  the executive officers and the board of directors of our new holding company are the same as those of the former dollar tree stores  inc in effect immediately prior to the reorganization 
the common stock of our new holding company will continue to be listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol dltr 
the rights  privileges and interests of our stockholders will remain the same with respect to our new holding company 
on february   we entered into a five year million credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility will be based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
our march  million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 
in november  we completed the  square foot expansion of our briar creek distribution center 
including this expansion  we believe that our nine distribution centers will support approximately billion in sales annually 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock 
this authorization was in addition to the november authorization which had approximately million remaining 
at february   we had approximately million remaining under board authorization 
in march  we completed our acquisition of deal stores and related assets 
we paid approximately million for store related assets and million for inventory 
on december   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting date of all previously issued  outstanding and unvested options under all current stock option plans  effective as of december  this decision eliminated non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment revised fas r  on january  compensation expense has been reduced by approximately million over a period of four years during which the options would have vested  as a result of the option acceleration program 
overview our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise 
two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends 
first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions 
second  sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next 
we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales  because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared 
we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales  which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales 
the term expanded also includes stores that are relocated 
at february   we operated  stores in states  with million selling square feet compared to  stores with million selling square feet at february  during fiscal  we opened stores  expanded stores and closed stores  compared to new stores opened  stores expanded and stores closed during fiscal in addition to the new stores opened in  we acquired deal stores on march  in the current year we achieved selling square footage growth 
of the million selling square foot increase in  million was added by expanding existing stores 
the average size of our stores opened in was approximately  selling square feet or about  gross square feet 
the average new store size decreased slightly in from approximately  selling square feet or about  gross square feet for new stores in for  we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately   selling square feet or about   gross square feet 
we believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an improved shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more 
we expect the substantial majority of our future net sales growth to come from the square footage growth resulting from new store openings and expansion of existing stores 
fiscal ended on february  and included weeks  commensurate with the retail calendar 
the rd week in added approximately million in sales 
fiscal and ended on february  and january   respectively  and both years included weeks 
in fiscal  comparable store net sales increased by 
this increase was based on the comparable weeks for both years 
we believe comparable store net sales were positively affected by a number of our initiatives over the past year  including expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores and the roll out of freezers and coolers to more of our stores 
during  we completed the roll out of pin capture debit card acceptance to all of our stores  which has enabled us to accept electronic benefit transfer cards and we now accept food stamps in approximately  qualified stores 
we believe the expansion of forms of payment accepted by our stores has helped increase the average transaction size in our stores 
on october   all of our stores began accepting visa credit as well  which we expect to have a positive impact on future sales 
we continued to experience a slight shift in the mix of merchandise sold to more consumables which we believe increases the traffic in our stores  however  this merchandise has lower margins 
the negative impact from the planned shift toward more consumables was smaller in than in the planned shift in mix to more consumables is partially the result of the roll out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more stores in and at february  we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately  stores compared to approximately stores at february  we believe that this will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers and increasing the average transaction size 
our point of sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores 
we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations and increased inventory turnover for each of the last two years 
inventory turnover improved by approximately basis points in compared to and by approximately basis points in compared to inventory per store has also remained constant at february  compared to february  despite slightly lower than expected fourth quarter sales and the increased merchandise flow due to the earlier easter season in we must continue to control our merchandise costs  inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses 
increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results 
our plans for fiscal anticipate net sales in the billion to billion range and diluted earnings per share of to 
this guidance for is predicated on selling square footage growth of approximately 
the earnings per share guidance for is exclusive of any share repurchase activity in on march   we completed our acquisition of deal stores 
these stores are located primarily in the midwest part of the united states and we have existing logistics capacity to service these stores 
this acquisition also included a few combo stores that offer an expanded assortment of merchandise including items that sell for more than substantially all deal stores acquired continue to operate under the deal banner while providing us an opportunity to leverage our dollar tree infrastructure in the testing of new merchandise concepts  including higher price points  without disrupting the single price point model in our dollar tree stores 
at february   of these stores were selling items priced over  compared to stores at february  we paid approximately million for store related and other assets and million for inventory 
the results of deal store operations are included in our financial statements since the acquisition date and did not have a significant impact on our operating results in fiscal or fiscal results of operations the following table expresses items from our consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of net sales year ended year ended year ended february  february  january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  net sales 
net sales increased  or million  in compared to  resulting primarily from sales in our new and expanded stores 
our sales increase was also impacted by a increase in comparable store net sales for the year 
this increase is based on the comparable weeks for both years 
these increases were partially offset by an extra week of sales in due to the week retail calendar for on a comparative week basis  sales increased approximately in compared to comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores  which we include in the calculation  and  to a lesser extent  are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february  and february  february  february  new stores deal acquisition acquired leases expanded or relocated stores closed stores of the million selling square foot increase in approximately million was added by expanding existing stores 
gross profit 
gross profit margin increased to in compared to in the increase was primarily due to a basis point decrease in merchandise cost  including inbound freight  due to improved initial mark up in many categories in the current year 
this decrease was partially offset by a basis point increase in occupancy costs due to the loss of leverage from the extra week of sales in the prior year and the lower comparable store net sales in the current year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for compared to for the increase is primarily due to the following operating and corporate expenses increased approximately basis points due to increased debit and credit fees resulting from increased debit transactions in the current year and the rollout of visa credit at october  also  in  we had approximately basis points of income related to early lease terminations 
occupancy costs increased basis points primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance costs in the current year 
partially offsetting these increases was an approximate basis point decrease in depreciation expense due to the expiration of the depreciable life on much of the supply chain hardware and software placed in service in operating income 
due to the reasons discussed above  operating income margin was in and income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in the rate for reflects a reduction of tax exempt interest income in the current year due to lower investment levels resulting from increased share repurchase activity and an increase in tax reserves in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
these increases more than offset a slight decrease in our net state tax rate 
fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased  or million  in compared to  resulting from sales in our new and expanded stores  including deal stores acquired in march and the weeks of sales in versus weeks in  which accounted for approximately million of the increase 
our sales increase was also impacted by a increase in comparable store net sales for the year 
this increase is based on a week comparison for both periods 
comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores  which we include in the calculation  and  to a lesser extent  are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones 
the following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended february  and january  february  january  new stores deal acquisition acquired leases expanded or relocated stores closed stores of the million selling square foot increase in  approximately million resulted from the acquisition of the deal stores and million was added by expanding existing stores 
gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to a basis point increase in merchandise cost  including inbound freight 
this increase in merchandise cost was due to a slight shift in mix to more consumables  which have a lower margin  higher cost merchandise at our deal stores and increased inbound domestic freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for as compared to for the increase is primarily due to the following payroll and benefit related costs increased basis points due to increased incentive compensation costs resulting from better overall company performance in as compared to and increased stock compensation expense  partially offset by lower workers compensation costs in operating and corporate expenses decreased basis points primarily as the result of payments received for early lease terminations in operating income 
due to the reasons discussed above  operating income margin decreased to in compared to in income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the decreased tax rate for was due primarily to increased tax exempt interest on certain of our investments in liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores  expand our distribution network and operate existing stores 
our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in september and october 
historically  we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
the following table compares cash related information for the years ended february   february   and january  year ended year ended year ended february  february  january  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million compared to last year due to increased working capital requirements in the current year and increases in the provision for deferred taxes  partially offset by improved earnings before depreciation and amortization in the current year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million compared to last year 
this decrease is due to million of increased proceeds from short term investment activity in the current year to fund increased capital stock repurchases and million used in the prior year to acquire deal assets 
these were partially offset by increased capital expenditures in the current year resulting from the briar creek distribution center and the corporate headquarters expansions 
net cash used in financing activities increased million due primarily to increased stock repurchases in the current year partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in the current year resulting from the company s higher stock price earlier in the year 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to increased earnings before depreciation and better payables management in  partially offset by approximately million of rent payments for february made prior to the end of fiscal the million decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to was the result of a million increase in net proceeds from short term investments which were used to help fund stock repurchases and the deal acquisition in in  we purchased an additional million  net  of investments in a restricted account to collateralize certain long term insurance obligations 
additional uses of cash for investing activities consisted of million for the deal acquisition in and an increase of million in capital expenditures due primarily to new store growth and the installation of freezers and coolers to certain stores in the million increase in cash used in financing activities in compared to primarily resulted from million in stock repurchases in compared to million in this increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from stock option exercises in resulting from our higher stock prices in as compared to at february   our long term borrowings were million and our capital lease commitments were million 
we also have million and million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements  under which approximately million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at february  on february   we entered into a five year million credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
our march  million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 
in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through march in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
this amount was in addition to the million remaining on the march authorization 
then  in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock 
this authorization was in addition to the november authorization which had approximately million remaining at the time 
in december  we entered into two agreements with a third party to repurchase approximately million of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement 
the first million was executed in an uncollared agreement 
in this transaction we initially received million shares based on the market price of our stock of as of the trade date december  
a weighted average price of was calculated using stock prices from december  march  this represented the calculation period for the weighted average price 
based on this weighted average price  we paid the third party an additional million on march  for the million shares delivered under this agreement 
the remaining million was executed under a collared agreement 
under this agreement  we initially received million shares through december   representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high end of the price range of the collar 
the number of shares received under the agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock  net of a predetermined discount  during the time after the initial execution date through march  the calculated weighted average market price through march   net of a predetermined discount  as defined in the collared agreement  was 
therefore  on march   we received an additional million shares under the collared agreement resulting in million total shares being repurchased under this agreement 
on march   we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase million of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement 
the entire million was executed under a collared agreement 
under this agreement  we initially received million shares through april   representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high end of the price range of the collar 
the number of shares was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock during the four months after the initial execution date 
the calculated weighted average market price through july   net of a predetermined discount  as defined in the collared agreement  was 
therefore  on july   we received an additional million shares under the collared agreement resulting in million total shares being repurchased under this agreement 
on august   we entered into an agreement with a third party to repurchase million of our common shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement 
the entire million was executed under a collared agreement 
under this agreement  we initially received million shares through september   representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high end of the price range of the collar 
the number of shares received under the agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of our common stock  net of a predetermined discount  during the time after the initial execution date through a period of up to four and one half months 
the contract terminated on october  and the weighted average price through that date was 
therefore  on october   we received an additional million shares resulting in million total shares repurchased under this agreement 
we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal  approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal and approximately million shares for approximately million in fiscal at february   the company had approximately remaining under board authorization 
funding requirements overview we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal to total approximately million  which includes capital expenditures  initial inventory and pre opening costs 
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal are between and million  including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores  the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately stores and completion of the expansion to our home office and data center in chesapeake  va 
we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at february   including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  and our commitments  excluding interest on long term borrowings in millions contractual obligations total thereafter lease financing operating lease obligations capital lease obligations long term borrowings revolving credit facility revenue bond financing interest on long term borrowings total obligations commitments total expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in expiring in thereafter letters of credit and surety bonds freight contracts technology assets total commitments lease financing operating lease obligations 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases 
the commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to february  for stores that were not yet open on february  capital lease obligations 
our capital lease obligations are primarily for distribution center equipment and computer equipment at the store support center 
revolving credit facility 
in march  we entered into a five year revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility provides for a million line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit 
interest is assessed under the line based on matrix pricing which currently approximates libor  plus 
this rate was at february  the facility also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the facility  payable quarterly 
the facility  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
the facility also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
we used availability under this facility to repay the million of variable rate debt and to purchase short term investments 
as of february   we had million outstanding on this facility 
on february   we entered into a five year million credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including up to million in available letters of credit  and a million term loan 
the interest rate on the facility will be based  at our option  on a libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee  calculated as a percentage  as defined  of the amount available under the line of credit  payable quarterly 
the term loan is due and payable in full at the five year maturity date of the agreement 
the agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually 
the agreement  among other things  requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness 
our march  million unsecured revolving credit facility was terminated concurrent with entering into the agreement 
revenue bond financing 
in may  we entered into an agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation under which it issued million of variable rate demand revenue bonds 
we used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition  construction and installation of land  buildings  machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in olive branch  mississippi 
at february   the balance outstanding on the bonds was million 
these bonds are due to be fully repaid in june the bonds do not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable 
the bonds contain a demand provision and  therefore  outstanding amounts are classified as current liabilities 
we pay interest monthly based on a variable interest rate  which was at february  interest on long term borrowings 
this amount represents interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the revenue bond financing using the interest rates for each at february  commitments letters of credit and surety bonds 
in march  we entered into a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement  which provides million for letters of credit 
in december  we entered into an additional letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement  which provides million for letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at february  we also have approximately million of letters of credit or surety bonds outstanding for our self insurance programs and certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores 
freight contracts 
we have contracted outbound freight services from various carriers with contracts expiring through february the total amount of these commitments is approximately million 
technology assets 
we have commitments totaling approximately million to primarily purchase store technology assets for our stores during derivative financial instruments we are party to one interest rate swap  which allows us to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on the demand revenue bonds 
the swap is based on a notional amount of million 
under the million agreement  as amended  we pay interest to the bank that provided the swap at a fixed rate 
in exchange  the financial institution pays us at a variable interest rate  which is similar to the rate on the demand revenue bonds 
the variable interest rate on the interest rate swap is set monthly 
no payments are made by either party under the swap for monthly periods with an established interest rate greater than a predetermined rate the knock out rate 
the swap may be canceled by the bank or us and settled for the fair value of the swap as determined by market rates and expires in because of the knock out provision in the million swap  changes in the fair value of that swap are recorded in earnings 
for more information on the interest rate swaps  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk beginning on page of this form k 
on march   we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swaps are used to manage the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our million variable rate term note 
under these agreements  we pay interest to financial institutions at a fixed rate of 
in exchange  the financial institutions pay us at a variable rate  which approximates the variable rate on the debt  excluding the credit spread 
we believe these swaps are highly effective as the interest reset dates and the underlying interest rate indices are identical for the swaps and the debt 
these swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these swaps expire in march critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates 
certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates 
following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical 
inventory valuation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average basis 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted average basis 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments  including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could  under certain circumstances  result in costs not being recorded in the proper period 
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  quantities of slow moving or seasonal  carryover merchandise on hand  historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside of our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual  historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted  if necessary  for current economic conditions 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and september of each year  therefore  the shrink accrual recorded at february  is based on estimated shrink for most of  including the fourth quarter 
we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately basis points in our dollar tree stores for the last two years 
however  we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition 
we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent 
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis 
accrued expenses on a monthly basis  we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses  self insurance programs  store level operating expenses  such as property taxes and utilities  and certain other expenses 
our freight and store level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results 
our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted annually based on a review performed by a third party actuary 
these actuarial valuations are estimates based on historical loss development factors 
certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them 
the related accruals are adjusted as management s estimates change 
differences in management s estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual 
our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low 
historically  the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates  including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing  applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management s projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual 
in addition  we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws  including relevant case law  and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and  if so  judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded 
we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate
