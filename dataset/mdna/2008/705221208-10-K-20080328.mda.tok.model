item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information elsewhere in this form k 
overview peco ii  inc was organized in for the purpose of acquiring the assets of itt s communications power product business 
today  we provide solutions to our telecommunications customers through a variety of products and services in order to meet their cost  quality  productivity and capacity challenges 
as part of this process  we design and manufacture communications specific power products 
we also provide on site e i  systems integration  installation  maintenance  and monitor services to our customers 
our power systems provide a primary supply of power to support the infrastructure of communications service providers  including local exchange carriers  long distance carriers  wireless service providers  internet service providers and broadband access providers 
our power distribution equipment directs this power to specific customer communications equipment 
our systems integration business provides complete built to order communications systems assembled and installed pursuant to customer specifications and incorporating other manufacturers products 
market conditions remain uncertain and difficult 
in the recent past  several of our customers have engaged in mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  such as sbc acquiring at t  at t acquiring bell south and cingular  alltel acquiring western wireless  and sprint acquiring nextel 
also  both sprint nextel and alltel spun off their local wireline businesses to focus on their core wireless businesses 
currently  major wireline companies are focusing their capital expenditure spending on fttc fiber to the curb and fttn fiber to the node for both broadband and video services distribution  while wireless companies are focusing their capital expenditure spending on migration of acquired systems to the standards of the acquiring carrier  integrating networks  improving area coverage  deploying g data services and have begun to announce plans to deploy wimax networks 
while the telecommunications market is extremely volatile  capital expenditure spending has expanded by the mid single digits in and analysts have projected further growth in and we believe this growth forecast provides us with an opportunity to capitalize on our customers capital expenditure plans 
in  we targeted the capital expenditure growth in the wireless market 
we successfully ramped the product  which was created to serve the wireless base station market  including both cabinet and hut applications  to volume production 
the was well received by the market  and is standardized at wireless operators 
this success was offset by the decline in purchases of wireless equipment from one of our major customers starting in late the acquisition of delta products us and canadian telecom power business added more cell site power solutions to our portfolio 
the hds product provides customers with either v or v operation using a horizontal distribution architecture 
customer preferences for distribution architecture vary by region  so the hds offers a true complement to the vertical style used by peco ii plants 
between the two  we are positioned to offer the right solution regardless of customer preference 
our r d investment extended beyond traditional cell site applications 
we modified our e inverter system to address a specific application at a major wireline carrier 
we also assimilated the hds large office power system from the delta acquisition 
this true phase power solution positions us to provide solutions for wireline central offices and wireless mobile switching centers 
our services group focused on hardening our solution portfolio to meet the power needs of out tier i customer base 
the revenue decline in was driven by reduced spending at one of our major customers due to m a related activity 

table of contents our services division continues to provide multi vendor engineering and installation services for all major power product brands 
this capability is both respected and valued in the marketplace 
our strong power e i services reputation has provided many opportunities for introducing new power products as well as a real user feedback channel on deployed products 
this feedback continues to aid us with designing and improving products to meet the industry evolving needs 
looking forward  we will continue to focus our efforts on delivering the service solutions our customers have come to expect from working with peco ii 
this dedication has enabled us to minimize customer turn over to a minimum 
we will continue to expand our services footprint on those opportunities that make the best utilization of our current available resources  and or those that position us for success as our industry matures to the next level 
critical accounting policies accounting in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition product revenues are recognized when customer orders are completed and shipped  title passes to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales sometimes include multiple items including services such as installation 
in such instances  product revenue is not recognized until installation is complete and the product is made available for customer use 
service revenues on engineering and installation contracts and the costs for services performed are primarily recorded as the work progresses on a percentage of completion basis 
management believes that all relevant criteria and conditions are considered when recognizing sales 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which include intangible assets  goodwill  and plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following sustained underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  their physical condition or the strategy for the company s overall business  
table of contents negative industry or economic trends  declines in stock price of an investment for a sustained period  the company s market capitalization relative to net book value  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit  or a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  unanticipated competition  and a loss of key personnel 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
product and service goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indications arise 
during the fourth quarter of each year  the company performs the annual impairment test for goodwill which did not result in any impairment for and during  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to the product segment goodwill 
the impairment charge was due to the product goodwill recognized as part of the delta acquisition being fully impaired  the decline in the peco ii stock price in  and the continued weakness in carrier spending for the wireless segment 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
inventory costs consist of purchased product  internal and external manufacturing costs  and freight 
management regularly reviews inventory for obsolescence or excessive quantities and records an allowance accordingly 
various factors are considered in making this determination  including recent usage history  forecasted usage and market conditions 
we continually review the inventory for obsolescence or excessive quantities and accrue accordingly 
at a minimum  all part numbers are reviewed quarterly 
we identify potential obsolete or excess inventory by identifying parts with no usage for a year and excess parts greater than the last twelve month usage or two times future six month requirements  whichever is greater 
management reviews the inventory identified as potentially obsolete or excess to determine the appropriate allowance 

table of contents deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the taxable entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
we previously accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no share based employee compensation cost for stock options was recognized in consolidated net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be different in the future 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the company recognizes share based compensation expense during the requisite service period for each award 
generally  stock options with a vest schedule of three years are expensed based upon a graded vesting schedule of during the first year  during the second year and during the third year 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items and the percentage of net sales from our consolidated statement of operations 
years ended december  net sales product services cost of goods sold product services product segment asset impairments gross margin product services operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative impairment of product segment goodwill real estate impairment loss from operations loss from joint venture loss from operations after joint venture interest income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this reduction was driven primarily by reduced spending at a major wireless customer for products and a major wireline customer for services 
net sales in our product segment decreased by million  with the result being million for the year ended december  as compared to million for year ended december  as of december   our product backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  had increased to million from million at december  net sales in our service segment decreased by million  resulting in million for year ended december  as compared with million for year ended december  as of december   our service backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  was million down million from year ended december  of million 

table of contents gross margin 
gross margin dollars increased to million in as compared to a million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in as compared to in this improvement was realized in both product and services segments as we begin to see the benefits of the operational improvements instituted in a portion of the improved gross margin includes the million of impairment recovery from the sale of previously impaired equipment 
as such  operationally the company improved its gross margin cost structure by million as a result of the company wide cost reduction initiatives implemented earlier in the year 
the product gross margin stayed flat at million in as compared to the product gross margin included additional excess and obsolescence reserves of thousand  an additional thousand in warranty costs  and also thousand gain from impairment recovery from the sale of previously impaired equipment 
gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased to in which includes the impacts of the impairment recovery as noted above  compared to in the service segment gross margin increased to million in as compared with the million in service gross margin as a percentage of service sales was in as compared to in this increase reflects the improved productivity of the services business resulting from business process improvements implemented in early research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million 
as a percentage of net product sales  research  development and engineering expense decreased to in from in the decrease represents the completion of nebs testing  which is required by many of our customers  and the completion of several new products that occurred in q selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased to in from in although as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative increased from the prior year due to decline in revenue  the costs decrease is primarily attributed to the results of the company s cost reduction programs implemented in interest income 
interest income  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in of this amount  interest expense was thousand in compared to thousand in the decrease in interest income  net  in the current year was due primarily to less income from investments offset by decreased interest expense due to the reduced use of the company s line of credit 
income taxes 
as a result of our significant continued operating losses in recent years  we have not been subject to significant income taxes and have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
as such  our effective income tax rate was a negative in compared to an effective rate of in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in the first two quarters of  the company experienced growth in line with the rest of the industry  while the remainder of the year we experienced a significant downturn in customer orders 
we believe this downturn was the result of mergers and consolidations that continue in the telecom industry 
net sales in our product segment increased by million  with the result being million for the year ended december  as compared to million for year ended december  the upward trend resulted from increased orders from a major wireless carrier along with the additional revenues from the delta acquisition 
as of december   our product backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales 
table of contents orders not yet recognized as revenue  had decreased to million from million at december  this decrease further reflects the decrease in firm orders received in the second half of net sales in our service segment increased by million  resulting in million for year ended december  as compared with million for year ended december  the service revenue increase was primarily due to the addition of a new region awarded by a major wireless customer 
as of december   our service backlog  which represents total dollar volume of firm sales orders not yet recognized as revenue  was million remaining flat with the prior year 
gross margin 
gross margin dollars decreased million to million in as compared to a million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in the product gross margin decreased to million in as compared to which had million 
the decrease in product gross margin included new and ongoing events  which included supply agreement amortization costs resulting from the delta transaction of thousand  and several one time events  which included delta transition acquisition costs of thousand  outsourcing inventory and fixed asset impairments of thousand  additional excess and obsolescence reserves of thousand  specific product lower of cost or market write down of thousand  and an additional thousand of additional warranty costs 
in addition  we recognized thousand of unabsorbed factory productions costs as a result of the decrease in orders 
gross margin as a percentage of product sales decreased to in which includes the adjustments above  compared to a in if the one time events were eliminated our gross margin would have seen an improvement over the service segment gross margin decreased to million in as compared with the million in service gross margin as a percentage of sales was in as compared to in the decrease in margin was primarily attributed to a new job outside of the united states mainland that required additional startup costs and a high learning curve 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of thousand 
as a percentage of net product sales  research  development and engineering expense decreased to in from in this percentage decrease was due to the increased sales volume along with decreased expense 
many of the projects completed in had already incurred the majority of the expense in resulting in a decrease of research and development expenses in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense increased to in from in this percentage increase was due to recognition of stock based compensation expense of thousand  non capitalized due diligence costs of thousand  amortization of customer relationship costs due to delta transaction of thousand  investment in the development of a manufactures representative group within our sales organization  and additional compensation costs 
interest income 
interest income  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in of this amount  interest expense was thousand in compared to thousand in the increase in interest income  net  in the current year was due primarily to additional cash invested from the sale of our manufacturing facility and the increase in interest rates on investments offset by decreased interest expense from due primarily to the payoff of certain long term debts during income taxes 
as a result of our significant continued operating losses in recent years  we determined a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required 
as such  our effective income tax rate was in compared to an effective rate of negative in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs for the foreseeable future will be for working capital and operations 
as of december   available cash and cash equivalents approximated million 
based on available funds and current plans  management believes that the company s available cash  borrowings and amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next months 
the assumptions underlying this belief include  among other things  that there will be no material adverse developments in the business or market in general 
there can be no assurances however that those assumed events will occur 
if management s plans are not achieved  there may be further negative effects on the results of operations and cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
working capital was million at december   which represented a working capital ratio of to  compared to million at december  our investment in inventories and accounts receivables was million and million at december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
our budgeted capital expenditures for is million as we remain focused on conserving cash 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at days at december   as compared to days at december  at december   inventory days on hand  which represents gross inventory excluding impairments or reserves  was days  as compared to days on hand at december  cash flows provided by operating activities were thousand in  compared to which had cash flows used by operating activities of million 
this positive cash flow was primarily the result of other non cash charges included in net loss primarily related to the goodwill impairment and decreases in accounts receivable offset by operating losses and increases in inventory 
we saw positive inflow of cash from investing activities resulting from the sale of excess property and equipment offset by capital expenditures 
from financing activities  we also had a positive inflow from the transfer of restricted cash offset by the repayment of our line of credit and payoff of our capital lease 
this is peco s first year of positive operating cash flow since we have an available line of credit agreement with national city bank for borrowing up to million 
in prior years  certain amounts of cash and cash equivalents were required as collateral based on the available borrowings and were reflected as restricted cash in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  during  the terms of the bank s security interest in the collateral account were amended to a formula based calculation that is dependent upon the outstanding amount of the line 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit 
therefore  the balance of the collateral account is free from restriction and is reflected in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  we believe that cash and cash equivalents  anticipated cash flow from operations  and our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we do not currently plan to pay dividends 
since february   we have not been in compliance with the nasdaq stock market s marketplace rule c  which requires the company to maintain a per share minimum closing bid price 
we had been granted until february  to regain compliance  but were unable to do so 
on february   nasdaq notified us that unless we requested an appeal of this determination  trading of our common shares would be suspended at the opening of businesses on february   and our securities would be removed from listing on nasdaq 
on february   we notified nasdaq that we were appealing the nasdaq determination of noncompliance with marketplace rule c to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
we presented the panel with our plan to regain compliance by seeking shareholder approval of a reverse split of our common shares at a ratio of for shares at the company s annual meeting of shareholders to be held on may  the hearing on the appeal by panel was on march   but a decision has not been rendered by the date of this annual report on form k 
if our common shares are delisted from nasdaq  it may be more difficult for us to raise additional capital as needed in the future 

table of contents we have operating leases covering certain office facilities  and equipment that expire at various dates through future minimum annual lease payments required during the years ending in through under non cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year are thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the following table provides a summary of our debt obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease payments  and certain other material purchase obligations as of december  in thousands total operating lease payments other purchase obligations total our operating lease obligations are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

we do not have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities that are not reflected in our financial statements 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency fluctuations 
we have not entered into interest rate or foreign currency transactions 
our foreign currency exposure was immaterial as of december   and our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our revolving line of credit facility 
however  at december   we had no borrowings under this facility 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to floating interest rate risk 
we believe a rate increase would have a minimal impact upon our net loss
