fiscal marked a year in which we positioned cache to report sustained growth in sales and profitability 
during the fall  with our merchandise assortments resonating with our core customers  the acquisition of avd  the launch of the cache accents program and the exit of the lillie rubin business completed  we began to implement marketing initiatives aimed at increasing customer loyalty and awareness of our cache brand 
we also extended cache s reach by appealing to a higher income consumer after the launch of cache luxe in fiscal finally  we began to take advantage of sourcing opportunities through the acquisition of avd which will produce higher gross margins for our company 
nonetheless  we were disappointed in our fourth quarter performance  as we did not experience the expected lift in sales during late december 
the company opened cache stores in fiscal and closed five cache stores

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventories 
our finished goods inventories at our retail stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation  which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
for our avd division  which makes up approximately of total inventory  the raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  using the first in first out valuation method 
the company ensures that the raw materials  work in process and finished goods are properly valued by taking into account any obsolescence and recording a reserve in accordance with our established policy 
finite long lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite long lived assets  we perform an analysis by store of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
no impairment charges were incurred in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to a one store  which the company closed in early in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of  for one store  which was closed in january goodwill and intangible assets 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
on december  sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment 
during fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of avd  the company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs annual impairment testing which considers the company s fair value to determine whether an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the company s recorded goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary 
as a result of this testing  the company concluded that there was no such impairment loss necessary in fiscal this is reevaluated annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if necessary  using similar testing 
self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for fiscal  and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we maintain stop loss insurance coverage which covers us for benefits paid in excess of limits as defined in the plan 
gift cards  gift certificates and credits 
the company sells gift cards and gift certificates gift cards and issues credits to its customers when merchandise is returned 
the company recognizes sales from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer and income when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage since the company has determined that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as abandoned property 
the company determines gift card breakage income based upon historical redemption patterns 
breakage income represents the balance of gift cards  for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
at that time  the company will recognize breakage income for those gift cards 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company formed a new subsidiary to handle all gift card sales and maintain the liability related to gift cards 
as a result of transferring all existing obligations to the newly formed subsidiary  the company recognized million of breakage income  within net sales  in the third quarter related to gift cards sold issued since the inception of the gift card program 
an additional  of breakage income was recognized in the fourth quarter of the company recorded  of breakage income in fiscal there was no breakage income recognized in fiscal revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter transaction or upon receipt by a customer 
sales of merchandise via our website are recognized at the expected time of delivery to the customer 
our customers have the right to return merchandise 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated returns 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns and record  as a reduction to sales  a provision for estimated product returns  which is determined based on historical experience 
charges or credits to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision were approximately   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales at the time of shipment 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
the company records revenues net of applicable sales tax 
in connection with the acquisition of avd  the company also acquired the rights to the mary l trademark 
mary l products are sold in upper tier department stores and as a result  mary l sales are included under net sales when the merchandise is shipped to the department stores 
mary l sales are recorded net of any returns  chargebacks  discounts and allowances 
we also maintain a reserve as a reduction to sales for potential returns  chargebacks  discounts and allowances 
the company reserved  for such items for fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  cache introduced a co branded customer credit card program 
under this program  the company receives from the issuing bank a non refundable credit card activation fee for each new account that is opened and activated 
these fees are initially deferred and recognized in consolidated net sales as revenue over the life of the contract 
during fiscal  the company received approximately  in connection with activated cards 
the amount of fee income recorded in connection with activated credit cards was insignificant in fiscal the company also offers its credit card holders a program whereby points can be earned on net purchases made with the co branded credit card 
five reward points are awarded for each dollar spent at cache and one reward point is awarded for each dollar spent at non cache businesses 
cardholders whose credit card account is not delinquent  in default or closed will be automatically eligible to receive a cache gift card upon accrual of  reward points 
the issuing bank bears the cost of the reward program and is responsible for the administration and management of the program 
the company also receives from the issuing bank and visa usa inc a sales royalty  which is based on a percentage of net purchases made by cardholders at cache or other businesses 
cache has determined that since it has not incurred any significant or recurring costs in relation to the co branded credit card program the sales royalties earned in connection to the agreement will be recorded under net sales 
the fees that are incurred by the company are cardholder incentives  which are funded from the fees paid by the issuing bank and visa usa inc the amount of sales royalty income recorded was insignificant in fiscal income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when tax contingencies become probable  a liability for the contingent amount is estimated based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions  as well as various tax filing positions 
as of december   the company does not have any material probable tax contingencies 
effective december   the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based upon its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
the cumulative effect of adoption of fin did not result in any adjustment in the company s liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
although the company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the company s accrued position 
accordingly  the company s provisions on federal  state and local tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
as of december   the company does not believe that its estimates  as otherwise provided for  on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
the company had previously reached agreement with the irs and closed the audit of fiscal year  with no change to the tax return 
the irs is currently finalizing its audit of the fiscal tax return 
the company anticipates there will be no change to the tax return 
as for state and local income taxes  with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to seasonality 
we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during the fourth quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during the third quarter july  august and september

net sales decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in fiscal net sales  as compared to fiscal reflects million reduction in net sales primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales declined in the fourth quarter  which caused comparable store sales for the year to decrease

gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  or  below the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from 
this decrease in gross profit was the combined result of lower net sales and an increase in markdowns  which was partially offset by an increase in initial markup as compared to fiscal also reducing gross profit was an increase in freight charges and our production facility costs  which rose and respectively in fiscal  as compared to fiscal this increase was offset by a decrease in our buying costs  which declined in fiscal  as compared to fiscal store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or above the prior fiscal year

the increase in depreciation expense is partially attributable to the increase in new stores  as well as an increase in store remodels 
we anticipate store operating expenses will decrease  as a percent of net sales in future years  as comparable store sales rise in our newer locations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate level payroll expense of  professional fees and legal settlements of  and was partially offset by a reduction in freight expense of  as well as a reduction in telephone expense of  due to the implementation of the new store communication system 
other income expense 
other income increased to million from million 
the increase is attributable to a legal settlement award and a landlord reimbursement for a store closing totaling  partially offset by lower interest income of  and interest expense charges of  related to the note payable recorded in connection with the acquisition of avd 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million from million  a decrease of million  below the same period last year 
the overall effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to an increase in tax free interest from municipal bond investments  in fiscal also contributing to the reduction in effective rate during fiscal was lower taxable income in fiscal several non recurring charges in fiscal  such as stock offering costs and non deductible incentive stock options caused the fiscal tax rate to be higher than our historical tax rate 
we anticipate the fiscal effective tax rate to approximate

as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased to million from million  as compared to the same period last year 
weeks ended december  fiscal compared to weeks ended december  fiscal net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase reflects million of additional net sales as a result of a increase in comparable store sales  excluding the comparable sales decline for lillie rubin sales 
the increase also included million of breakage income  as a result of the conversion of our gift card system from a paper based to a card based system 
the remainder of the increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable new cache and cache luxe store sales  partially offset by a decrease in lillie rubin sales  due to the exit from this business 
the improvement in net sales was driven by an increase in dress sales  primarily shorter length dresses  as dress sales increased to of total sales from in fiscal accessory sales continued to improve  increasing to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the combined result of higher net sales and increased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from

also contributing to higher gross margins in fiscal was a decrease in buying and occupancy expenses of  as a percent of sales  as compared to fiscal store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  store operating expenses increased to from 
the increase in store operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in stores opened over the past two years  as well as due to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of million

net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased to million from million  a decrease of million or  below the same period last year 
quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during our fourth fiscal quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during our third fiscal quarter july  august and september 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters during the two year period ended december  we derived this data from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the construction of new stores and inventory for new stores as well as the remodeling of existing stores 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had working capital of million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
the following table sets forth our cash flows for the period indicated in thousands weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  a decrease in inventories of million was primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand in stores  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million was primarily due to a reduction in prepaid rents as compared to fiscal  an increase in accrued liabilities of million was primarily due to higher customer credits and share repurchase liability  as compared to fiscal and  from non cash stock based compensation expense  which were partially offset by an decrease in accounts payable of million  reversal of deferred rent of million was primarily from new store openings and a decrease in deferred income taxes of million was primarily due to timing of depreciation 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  million from non cash lillie rubin exit costs  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  million from non cash stock based compensation and a decrease in accounts receivable of  million  partially offset by accounts payable decrease of million  primarily due to reduction in the number of vendors and the increase in direct purchases paid via letter of credit 
inventories increased million  while we reversed deferred rent of million and recorded in non cash gift card breakage of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in deferred taxes and  an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts were used for the purchase of marketable securities  the payment for equipment and leasehold improvements in new and remodeled stores  as well as improvements to the pos system and for the acquisition of our largest vendor  avd 
our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately to million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily for the repurchase of our common stock of million 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from stock issuances and stock option exercises  as well as excess tax benefits from option exercises of million 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to cash provided from the proceeds of common stock issuances 
we have a line of credit with bank of america  na  successor in interest to fleet bank  na permitting us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum annual rate equal to the bank s prime rate  currently at february   less 
the agreement relating to this facility contains certain financial and other covenants 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness or create or incur liens on our assets 
while this facility is unsecured  if a default occurs under the facility  we are required to grant the lender a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
we have been in compliance with all financial loan covenants  during the fiscal periods presented 
this facility currently expires in november we believe that cash flow from operations  our current available cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due in period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations employment contracts   purchase obligations   operating leases     note payable     total      payments due in period total within year years years after years in thousands commercial commitments standby letters of credit total we issue standby letters of credit primarily for the importation of merchandise inventories 
the operating leases included in the table on the page do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which represented approximately of minimum rent expense in fiscal  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum rent expense in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear the risk in two specific ways 
first  the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  the statement of income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowing under our credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet  if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
