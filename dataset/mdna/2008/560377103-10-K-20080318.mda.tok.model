therefore  no assurances can be given that the outcomes stated in such forward looking statements and estimates will be achieved 
annual performance summary in last year s form k  we stated that was a pivotal year for management and the board of directors 
that proved to be true 
during the year  we successfully implemented our change in strategy by divesting our unregulated and unprofitable business lines  shown below as discontinued operations  and embraced a strategy of performing utility and utility related services 
the success of this simple yet profound shift is evident in our financial performance for the year 
net income and earnings per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts income loss from continuing operations regulated electric utility other income from continuing operations loss income from discontinued operations unregulated engineering services unregulated software technology unregulated energy marketing other loss from discontinued operations net income loss basic income loss per share the other line in continuing operations includes activities of the holding company including corporate costs directly associated with unregulated operations and common costs not allocated to the regulated utility  mam utility services group and inter company eliminations 
other in discontinued operations is inter company eliminations 

table of contents our total revenues increased while our operating expenses decreased due to meeting our objectives of streamlining operations and lowering corporate overhead costs 
the end result was a dramatic increase in our operating income over and we worked on lowering our overall debt balances  which reduced net interest expenses by nearly 
in  income from continuing operations was approximately four times greater than and almost three times greater than the bottom line is a dramatic improvement in our net income available to shareholders  which produced consolidated net income of million in  compared with a significant loss in this transformation led to a striking improvement in our stock price  which increased more than two and a half times during the year  ending calendar year at per share and reaching a high closing price of on december  this price was an eighteen year high for the company  and nearly an all time high 
this trend dramatically increased our average volume of shares and attracted a number of new investors 
overview of company strategy while we celebrate our successes of  we are not content with just this progress 
it is of critical importance that we operate efficiently and continue to pursue investments to further enhance the company s performance and the future interests of our shareholders 
to that end  our strategy focuses on two key areas efficiently managing and maximizing our regulated utility operations  and utilizing our core management competencies to pursue other unregulated opportunities in utility related services 
utility operations maine public service company  our regulated electric transmission and distribution utility  has been serving customers in our territory since incorporating in for the past years  it has been our objective to provide our customers with safe  reliable and competitively priced electricity service 
mps remains focused on managing and investing in our utility asset infrastructure 
mps made substantial investments in our core electrical system  and anticipates maintaining this level of investment over the next few years 
capital expenditures for were approximately million 
for through  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million per year  with each year s capital budget being reviewed and approved by our board 
these capital expenditures are relatively large compared to past years as a result of matching our strong cash flows during the next four years from our regulatory asset stranded cost collections with our capital improvement plans 
the investments in these assets will help provide regulated returns to our shareholders during their useful life  assuming favorable regulatory treatment 
our valued employees at mps take pride in providing quality customer service while seeking opportunities to improve efficiencies 
these efficiencies include implementing automated meter reading for the majority of our customers as well as automating our electrical equipment to protect against system damage  improving response to power outages  and lowering overall costs by performing functions electronically instead of traveling to remote locations 
while we are optimistic about the future for mps  we recognize that our utility has challenges similar to other small geographically remote utilities  as well as some challenges unique to our company 
these challenges include  but are not limited to relatively slow customer growth  approximating per year  low customer densities  currently connected electrically to canada  not the united states  slow economic growth within our region  
table of contents difficulty in attracting and retaining quality employees due to our geographic location  rapidly amortizing regulatory assets  aging infrastructure  climate and weather conditions in our service territory  and federal and state regulations 
even with these challenges  we believe we can be successful in providing a quality return to our shareholders 
by aggressively managing our regulated assets and providing high quality customer service  we believe we can continue to provide our customers with safe  reliable and competitively priced transmission and distribution service while providing a competitive regulated rate of return for our shareholders 
to offset some of these challenges  mps is pursuing the development of a large transmission line  which would connect our service territory to the new england electrical grid 
the construction of this transmission line  known as the maine power connection mpc  is being jointly pursued by mps and central maine power company  the largest electric utility in the state of maine 
coincident with potential development of this line is the siting of additional electricity generation within and adjacent to our service territory 
this confluence of factors could have several benefits to mps including increasing transmission revenues from use of the line by electricity generators  increasing mps s asset base  enhancing the competitive electricity market in northern maine  attracting potential economic development to our region in the form of new industrial  commercial  and residential customers  providing a unique conduit for generators in canada to potentially ship their product to the southern new england market where electricity supply is needed  providing a larger scale of transmission users which may stabilize or reduce rates for current transmission customers  enhancing electric system stability and security for existing customers  connecting much needed green power such as wind  and other renewable electricity producing resources to enhance the power mix for the new england grid  and providing mps s sister company  mam usg  with additional opportunities to provide shareholder returns 
this mpc project is being undertaken simultaneously with an on going system impact study at iso ne  which was triggered by interconnection requests in connection with proposed wind generation projects 
the company has submitted notice to iso ne that  subject to certain conditions  it seeks to become a member of iso ne 
among the conditions is the requirement that the cost of the transmission project be included in the iso ne regional transmission rates 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this request  and it is possible that the conditions necessary for membership will not be met 
it is also possible that mps will seek to have all or a portion of the mpc project costs covered by the parties requesting interconnection pursuant to its large generation interconnection agreement and tariff 
unregulated services a key component of our new strategy is to provide complementary services to our regulated utility operations by leveraging our core competencies 
we formed an unregulated subsidiary in september to pursue these initiatives 
this subsidiary  mam utility services group  will provide electrical contracting  engineering  planning  procurement  and project management services to developers  generators  and others in the private and public sectors 
mam usg is currently in the process of negotiating contracts to provide these services 

table of contents while this subsidiary is in its early developmental stages  we believe that it offers a growth component for our shareholders in addition to the stable annuity provided by the regulated utility 
discontinued operations we consider our accomplishments during in divesting our discontinued operations to be a significant success 
our prioritized efforts to divest the unregulated software technology  engineering and real estate companies were largely completed during the year 
as of december   the only assets remaining from our prior strategy diversifying into a broader range of businesses is limited to the ownership of mecel properties and one share of maricor properties 
we are working diligently to divest these remaining investments  and anticipate completion of these sales by the end of dividend policy with the improvement in our cash flows during  the increase in consolidated earnings  and the related pay down of total debt  the company will likely be in a position to reinstitute a dividend to common shareholders toward the end of or early in cash priorities for  as discussed by management and the board  are as follows investment in mam usg projects that provide adequate returns for shareholders generally defined to be at or above average regulated rates of return  repayment of remaining unregulated debt related to previous strategy approximately million at december   and re establishment of a dividend to common shareholders  when fiscally prudent and adequate cash flows are available after consideration of all cash priorities noted above 
similar to the dividend policy stated in the form k  dividends are subject to declaration by the board  which establishes the amount of each quarterly common stock dividend and fixes the record and payment dates 
common stock dividends  when declared  are generally paid on the first day of january  april  july  and october 
our prior dividend was suspended in after consecutive quarters of paying a dividend 
cash flows in  we expect cash flows provided by operating activities will come from mps  the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility  as well as mam usg  the electrical service provider to developers  generators  and others in the private and public sectors 
cash flows at mps will remain higher than our net income would indicate  due to the collection of previously deferred regulatory assets being collected 
these cash flows are stranded cost free cash flows 
the largest regulatory asset is deferred fuel  which is expected to be collected through this asset represents past cash expenditures that will be amortized as collected in rates over time 
therefore  while the portion of revenue associated with recovery of this stranded cost is a cash inflow  the related amortization of the deferred fuel asset is non cash 
the stranded cost free cash flows will be utilized in accordance with our cash priorities listed above 
an estimate of these cash inflows  net of income taxes  is listed below in thousands of dollars this table presents the regulatory treatment from mpuc docket no 
stranded cost rates from january  through december   were set by this docket 
a projection of the recovery period for the balance of stranded costs remaining at december   was also included in the docket  however  the 
table of contents schedule for recovery of these costs will not be approved by regulatory order until the next stranded cost rate case  anticipated to be filed in also  other factors  such as our capital expenditures being included as income earning regulated assets  costs of providing our regulated services  and competitiveness of rates at the time  could necessitate filing a distribution rate case during or soon after the stranded cost free cash flow period  which may result in significant rate changes for our customers 
we cannot predict at this time whether this impact will be positive or negative to mps s net income 
due to its infancy  the impact of mam usg on cash flow is difficult to predict 
however  any contracts signed are expected to have positive incremental cash flows and related earnings for mam on a consolidated basis 
taxes other than income taxes other than income consist of property and payroll taxes 
this expense decreased from million in to million in taxes other than income were also approximately million in income tax expense benefit the tax provision for the regulated entity was approximately million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase is due to the improvement in mps earnings in  resulting from both increased revenue and reduced expenses 
the income tax benefit for unregulated continuing operations decreased from million in and  in to  in  primarily due to the reduction in the loss for this segment 
other income deductions other income deductions consists of equity in the earnings of maine yankee  mepco and maricor properties  interest and dividend income  and other  smaller non operating income and expense items 
the  loss in is representative of the company s on going  non operating activity 
in  the equity in income of associated companies included the profit recognized on the issuance of one share of maricor properties to ashford  which resulted in income of  this additional income was partly offset by the  write off of unrecoverable cancelled transmission plant 
interest charges interest charges decreased  from million in to million in most of this decrease  approximately  is a result of the increased stranded cost carrying charges  primarily on the deferred fuel balance 
with this balance at its maximum at december   the carrying charges recognized on the balance  an offset to interest expense  were also at their highest 
interest expense also decreased  due to the repayments of debt during  primarily the million mam note with bank of america 
from to  interest charges increased  from  to million 
the increase is due to higher average balances outstanding  including the higher rate mam debt

mps anticipates that its system will require such higher levels of capital expenditures for the next several years 
detailed analysis of changes in financial condition by operating segment regulated utility operations continuing operations the following discussion includes the operations of mps and me nb net income regulated electric utility in thousands earnings per share from regulated electric utilities mps contributed or more to earnings per share in than in this improved performance is due to a combination of increases in revenue and decreases in expenses  explained more fully below

medium and small commercial customer revenue volume increased  increasing revenue by approximately  rate increases increased medium and small commercial customer revenue by approximately  the large commercial customers were the only customers for which revenue decreased from to  falling  or 
volume increased slightly  up mwh or  but this increase was more than offset by lower average rates 
the reduction in average rates is a result of a shift in the mix of large commercial customers  our lowest rate industrial customers made up a greater percentage of our large commercial sales volume in than in there are many positive and negative factors which may have an impact on our future financial statements 
for example  while the fuel cost trends may lead to more difficulty in accounts receivable collections  the actual uncollectible experience in remained consistent with the past 
further  two mills classified as large commercial customers announced temporary shutdowns during the length of the shutdowns and their ultimate impact on regulated utility operating revenue in is undetermined at this time 
this loss of revenue is partly offset by an increase in transmission wheeling revenue from additional generation 
the final net impact of each of these factors is not yet known  but management is continuously monitoring collections and the overall economy of its service territory for the potential impact on revenue 
a significant contributor to the overall increase in mps revenue was the  or increase in other regulated operating revenue 
the majority of this increase was due to additional wheeling revenue 
mps s transmission rates are based on the company s revenue requirement transmission expenses plus the allowed return on assets less the wheeling revenue earned 
the rates go into effect on july each year  and are calculated from the financial results of the previous calendar year 
the additional wheeling revenue earned during will offset the revenue requirement in the establishment of the rates that will go into effect on july  this additional wheeling revenue was partly offset by the decrease in revenue from billable work from to overall  regulated retail revenue increased approximately  or from to  due to the rate increase 
the impact of the revenue increase was partly offset by the approximately  mwh or decrease in volume year over year 
residential customer revenue was the majority of the increase in revenue dollars from to  up  similarly  medium and small commercial customer revenue increased  and  respectively 
in each of these classes of customers  the volume decrease was approximately 
the decrease in volume is due to the warmer weather experienced in the utility s service territory  primarily during the first quarter of large customer revenue decreased approximately  due to two large commercial customers that were not operating for a portion of as of the end of  both customers were back in operation 
other regulated operating revenue increased  or from to during  mps obtained work on various billable projects  including the evergreen wind farm project in mars hill  maine  which contributed to this increase

workers compensation insurance premiums decreased  due to improved claims experience 
pension and post retirement medical expenses decreased  due to the decrease in pension expense as a result of the december   pension freeze  offset by the k make up contributions 
holding company management costs decreased  or from lower common costs  due to the reduction in the overall size and cost of mam management and external consulting arrangements from to maintenance expenses also decreased  down  or 
the majority of the decrease is the  decrease in expense associated with our financial system hosting contract 
as part of the distribution rate case  the costs of this contract are split one third mam unallocated reported in other continuing operations and two thirds mps 
this split began july   and was in effect for all of  compared to half of the renegotiation of the contract  described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  also reduced the overall cost of the contract 
offsetting these decreases were increases in regulatory and licensing expenses  and other operation and maintenance expenses  as follows regulatory and licensing expenses increased  or  due to higher regulatory assessments in these assessments are expected to continue at these rates or higher in other expenses increased  or over prior year 
bad debt expense increased  or from to in light of the economy of the region and rising energy costs  we will continue to closely monitor our collections experience

in  bad debt expense was adjusted to recognize that mps bears no risk associated with the collection of sos receivables  resulting in a negative expense of  in  bad debt expense increased  returning to more normal levels 
regulatory expenses increased  year over year 
the distribution rate case increased regulatory expense by approximately  from a combination of internal costs which were immediately expensed  and amortization of the external legal costs that were deferred and will be amortized over the next three years 
the oatt process  including the update of the formula calculation  increased expense approximately  while the assessment for the power pact program increased approximately  with the freeze of pension service and salary accruals effective december   a one time curtailment expense of  was recorded in in accordance with sfas these increases were offset by the  decrease in holding company management costs 
the decrease was a result of the change in interpretation of how the common cost allocation percentages are calculated  as a result of the distribution rate case  which lowered the allocation to mps from approximately in to approximately in also  the overall common cost pool decreased approximately  from to  as a result of decreased labor expense from the decentralization of the human resource  information technology and accounting functions

critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s most critical accounting policies for continuing operations include regulatory assets and liabilities  revenue recognition  income taxes and pension and post retirement medical expenses 
certain accounting policies were also critical to the company s discontinued operations  including goodwill and intangible assets  but will not be critical to the company s on going operations 
the critical accounting policies are described in detail below 
continuing operations regulatory assets and liabilities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company capitalizes  as regulatory assets  incurred and accrued costs that are probable of recovery in future electric rates 
it also records  as regulatory liabilities  obligations to refund previously collected revenue or to spend revenue collected from customers on future costs 
unfunded future income taxes and deferred income taxes are amortized as the related temporary differences reverse 
unamortized loss on debt retirements is amortized over the lives of the related debt issues 
nuclear plant obligations  deferred fuel costs  other regulatory assets and other regulatory liabilities are amortized over various periods in accordance with mps s current rate plans 
mps earns a return on substantially all regulatory assets for which funds have been spent 
the company believes mps s electric transmission and distribution operations continue to meet the requirements of sfas  and regulatory assets associated with those operations  as well as any generation related costs the mpuc has determined to be recoverable from ratepayers  also meet the criteria 
at december   million of regulatory assets remained on mps s books 
these assets will be amortized over various periods in accordance with mpuc approved rate orders 
revenue recognition mps records an estimate for electricity delivered  but not yet billed to customers 
this estimate requires mps to make certain assumptions 
a change in those assumptions could cause the amounts reported as revenues to change 

table of contents in july  mps began recording the difference between the approved tariff rate for two large industrial customers and their current special discount rates  under contracts approved by the mpuc  as accrued revenue 
the resulting deferred asset will be subsequently collected in rates as approved by the mpuc

pension and other post retirement benefit plans mps has pension and other post retirement benefit plans  principally health care benefits  covering substantially all of its employees and retirees 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer s accounting for pensions  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer s accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets are subject to various assumptions 
the primary assumptions include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  health care cost inflation rates  expected years of future service under the pension benefit plans and the methodology used to amortize gains or losses 
changes in those assumptions could also have a significant effect on the company s non cash pension income or expense  or the company s post retirement benefit costs 
for additional information on the company s benefit plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements  benefit programs 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires an asset and liability approach to accounting and reporting income taxes 
sfas prohibits net of tax accounting and requires the establishment of deferred taxes on all differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their basis for financial reporting 
for the years ended december   and  management evaluated the deferred tax asset valuation and determined no valuation allowance was needed 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective on a catch up basis for fiscal years beginning after december  this guidance interprets sfas  accounting for income taxes  and clarifies the existing guidance regarding recognition of uncertain tax positions 
under fin  a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position can only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits and relevant administrative practices 
the amount of the tax benefit allowed to be recognized is limited to the greatest amount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than likely of being realized 
the guidance also notes that these tax benefits can become recognized or derecognized as new information becomes available 
for additional information on the company s income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
mps has deferred investment tax credits and amortizes the credits over the remaining estimated useful life of the related utility plant 
mps records regulatory assets or liabilities related to certain deferred tax liabilities or assets  representing its expectation that  consistent with current and expected ratemaking  these taxes will be recovered from or returned to customers through future rates 

table of contents discontinued operations goodwill and acquired intangibles the company s acquisitions of res  m r  eastcan and pace resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affected the amount of amortization expense and impairment expense the company incurred 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that the company  on an annual basis  calculate the fair value of the reporting units containing the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units  management relied on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
if actual fair value is less than the company s estimates  goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings 
for impairment testing purposes  the reporting unit was defined as the acquired operations 
for these acquisitions  the operations acquired became the mechanical and electrical engineering components of tmgc and tmgne 
all goodwill associated with these acquisitions was written off during  concurrent with the company s adjustment for discontinued operations 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases used for office and field equipment  vehicles and computer hardware and software  accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see item of this form k  note to consolidated financial statements  commitments  contingencies and regulatory matters  under off balance sheet arrangements for a summarization of payments for leases for a period in excess of one year for the years ended december  and table of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands of dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations capital lease obligations financial system hosting contract consulting arrangments employment agreements total interest payments presented above include the estimated interest payments required on mps s fixed rate  long term debt 
interest payments on variable rate short and long term debt have been excluded from this presentation  as the amount cannot be quantified at this time 
mps has one lease for a right of way with an undefined term 
because the amount of the liability cannot be determined  this lease has been excluded from the more than years column 
this lease payment is approximately  per year 

table of contents capital lease obligations include both required principal and interest payments 
consulting arrangements consist of outsourced engineering and information technology consulting 
operating capital and liquidity mam s operating capital and liquidity has significantly improved during for three primary reasons 
collection of previously deferred regulatory assets stranded cost free cash flows  proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations assets  and improved financial performance of continuing operations 
collection of regulatory assets the cash collections from mps customers for previously deferred regulatory assets  or stranded cost free cash flows  began january  as stated previously in this section  those collections for  net of deferred tax payments  were million 
the collections of these previously deferred items will continue through for a total cash flow  net of deferred tax obligations  of approximately million  with the majority collected between january  and december   which total approximately million  net of deferred tax obligations 
in accordance with utility industry practice  these deferred regulatory assets are presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the heading regulatory assets  and are not reported as current assets 
however  the portion of these cash flows  net of deferred income taxes  will be approximately million which will be available to satisfy current obligations 
proceeds from sales of discontinued operations assets the proceeds from the sale of discontinued assets totaled approximately million canadian  or million us 
these proceeds were collateral for loans with katahdin trust company and were used to repay the million line of credit and  of the million note 
with the discontinuance of these operations  less working capital requirements were used to fund these unprofitable ventures during starting in  limited working capital will be needed related to the discontinued operations 
any of these obligations will be satisfied by the holding company  mam  and include the continuance of professional liability insurances and building lease obligations 
these cash requirements for and beyond are not expected to be material to our overall cash flows 
improved financial performance of continuing operations the overall financial performance of continuing operations dramatically improved 
net income from continuing operations increased from  in to million in similarly  net income for was million  compared with a million loss in these improvements are largely a result of mps financial performance  the write off of goodwill and intangible assets in  and the realignment of corporate structure and related overhead costs at mam 
cash flow performance the company s cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december   to  at december  net cash flow provided by operating activities increased dramatically  up approximately million from to for the three reasons described above 
the company s statements of consolidated cash flows  of the company s consolidated financial statements as presented in item of this form k  reflects the company s liquidity and sources of operating capital 
cash flow provided by operating activities in was million  while the net income for the year was million  due to the improved financial performance and the discontinuance of unprofitable operations 

table of contents the change in deferred regulatory and debt issuance costs was million 
in  there were additional deferrals of wheelabrator sherman ws stranded cost  as the payments we made for the output of the ws plant exceeded the recovery we were allowed 
this trend reversed in  as mps no longer had the obligation under the ws contract and was allowed under regulation to begin the collection of these previously deferred regulatory assets beginning january  net cash flow used by financing activities totaled million for debt retirements 
in  million of net cash flow was used for investing activities 
the company invested million in fixed assets at mps for its electrical system infrastructure

in june  this line was fully paid with the proceeds from the sale of the assets of tmgc 
as part of the refinancing of short term borrowings during  mam and certain of its subsidiaries agreed to certain financial and other covenants  such as debt service coverage and earnings before interest and taxes ebit ratios 
in the event of a default  the various lenders could require immediate repayment of the debt 
a default could also trigger increases in interest rates  difficulty obtaining other sources of financings and cross default provisions within the debt agreements 
a default on the mps line of credit with bank of america is a cross default on the mam line of credit with bank of america 
in addition  mam has guaranteed a tmg facility with katahdin trust company and a maricor properties term loan with rbc 
mam and mps have met all debt covenants for the year and expect to be in compliance with all debt covenants for the foreseeable future

this waiver agreement included interim revisions to the interest coverage ratio covenants for and revised covenants for thereafter 
it also included a conversion of the bank of america million line of credit from a revolving credit agreement to a million term note and retained the rbc million letter of credit 
this revised agreement became effective march   and was reported in our form k

with this conversion  minimum principal balances must be repaid at a rate of  per month  beginning january  on february   million was repaid on the bank of america term loan  as cash was available for early repayment without penalty 
we estimate mam cash flows will be sufficient to fully repay the remaining balance of the term note during leaving only the letter of credit outstanding pending a sale and subsequent lifting of the rbc million letter of credit by the purchaser of mam s investment in maricor properties

we anticipate these rate changes to be effective in march or april the amendments include various reductions in interest rates on the lines of credit and decreased letter of credit fees on the mps and mam bank of america financing 
the letter of credit fees are estimated to save  over the remaining term of the bonds  through the savings related to the interest rate reductions on the lines of credit are dependent on the level of borrowing under those lines
