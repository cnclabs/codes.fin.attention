this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview opnet technologies  inc is a provider of software products and related services for managing networks and applications 
our software products and related services address application performance management  network operations  capacity management  and network research and development 
our customers include corporate enterprises  government and defense agencies  network service providers  and network equipment manufacturers 
our software products and related services are designed to help our customers make better use of resources  reduce operational problems and improve competitiveness 
we operate in one reportable industry segment  the development and sale of computer software programs and related services 
our operations are principally in the united states  and we have subsidiaries in australia  belgium  france  germany  the united kingdom and singapore 
the wholly owned subsidiary in singapore was registered in august we primarily depend upon our direct sales force to generate revenue in the united states 
sales outside the united states are made through our international sales team as well as third party distributors and value added resellers  who generally are responsible for providing technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our revenue is derived from three primary sources new software licenses  software license updates  technical support and services  and professional services  which include consulting and training services for customers without current maintenance agreements 
new software license revenue represents all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software and fees associated with hardware necessary to run our software  and excludes revenue derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates  technical support  and services revenue 
our software master license agreement provides our customers with the right to use our software either perpetually  which we refer to as perpetual licenses  or during a defined term  generally for one to four years  which we refer to as term licenses 
for the twelve months ended march   perpetual licenses represented approximately of software license revenue 
substantially all of our software license arrangements include both perpetual and or term licenses and software license updates  technical support  and services 
software license updates  technical support  and services revenue represent fees associated with the sale of unspecified license updates  technical support and when and if available training under our maintenance agreements 
we offer professional services  under both time and material and fixed price agreements  primarily to facilitate the adoption of our software products 
we consider our consulting services to be an integral part of our business model as they are centered on our software product offerings 
because our consulting services facilitate the adoption of our software product offerings  we believe that they ultimately generate additional sales of software licenses 
the key strategies of our business plan include increasing sales to existing customers  increasing deal size by selling modules and introducing new software products  improving our sales and marketing execution  establishing alliances to extend our market reach  increasing our international presence and increasing profitability 
we have focused our sales  marketing  and other efforts on corporate enterprise and united states government opportunities  and to a much lesser extent  service provider and network equipment manufacturer 
table of contents opportunities 
our focus and strategies are designed to increase revenue and profitability 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the amount and timing of revenue growth  we expect to need to closely control the increases in our total expenses as we implement these strategies 
in march  we launched an initiative to extend our market reach by establishing sales alliances with third parties called the synergy program 
the synergy program is designed to increase the penetration of our software products into mid sized organizations 
the synergy program s initial focus will be on selling our application performance management software products  including ace live that provides end user experience monitoring and real time application performance analytics  as we believe these software products are particularly well suited for channel distribution 
in march  we restructured our worldwide distribution agreement with cisco systems  or cisco 
under the terms of the restructured agreement  cisco will distribute our software products as opnet branded software products 
in april  we entered into a multi year worldwide distribution agreement with computer associates that built upon the referral agreement entered into with computer associates in november of under the terms of the agreement  computer associates is distributing our it guru systems planner solution as a ca branded solution and we are collaborating with computer associates to offer professional services and support 
in november  we entered into a global sales and marketing referral agreement with computer associates 
under the terms of the agreement  computer associates began marketing our systems performance and capacity modeling technologies as opnet branded software products 
computer associates began sales of our products under this agreement in the third quarter of fiscal acquisition of specified assets of network physics on october   we completed the acquisition of specified assets of network physics for a total purchase price of  we paid the purchase price in cash from working capital 
as a result of the acquisition  we acquired technology that enabled us to accelerate the release of our ace live software product  which had been in development since the summer of and were under development to address the appliance based end user monitoring market 
in addition to the technology acquired from network physics  we also acquired several non executive employees to provide us with greater engineering depth and technical expertise 
we did not acquire network physics value added reseller agreements or associated relationships  which generated substantially all of their revenue 
the purchase of specified assets of network physics did not constitute the purchase of a business for purposes of sec reporting or for purposes of financial reporting under sfas  business combinations or eitf no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
most key attributes of network physics necessary for continuity of operations did not remain with the acquired assets after the acquisition including a portion of the non executive employee base  executive employees  market distribution systems and customer maintenance contracts 
furthermore  the transferred set of network physics activities could not sustain normal operations for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
management believes that financial information related to network physics prior to the acquisition would not be material or relevant to an understanding of our operations subsequent to the asset acquisition for several key reasons 
first  value added resellers used by network physics to market and distribute their products to customers and generate substantially all of their revenue were not acquired 
second  significant changes were made to the purchased technology in order to distribute the technology to our customers 
third  our decision to purchase specified assets of network physics was based on the end user appliance based market opportunity that we believe exists and the complementary nature of our existing performance management software products to 
table of contents the end user appliance based market and was not based on the nature and amount of revenue historically generated by network physics 
finally  we did not acquire the rights to any continuing revenue stream including customer maintenance contracts 
summary of our fiscal financial performance during fiscal  our income from operations and net income decreased as compared to fiscal the decrease in profitability was primarily the result of an increase in total operating expenses and a decrease in license revenue  which have higher gross margins than our other sources of revenue 
the increase in operating expenses was largely the result of increased personnel costs and costs related to acquiring technology necessary to pursue our growth strategies 
the decrease in license revenue was predominantly the result of a decrease in license sales to united states and international government customers 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of march  decreased as compared to march  largely due to the acquisition of specified assets of network physics for a total cash purchase price of  our deferred revenue as of march  increased as compared to march   largely due to an increase in sales of software license updates  technical support and services arrangements 
the following table summarizes information on some of our key financial and operating metrics 
fiscal fiscal amount change percentage change dollars in thousands  except per share data operations data total revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross profit as a percentage of total revenue gross margin total operating expenses loss income from operations loss income from operations as a percentage of total revenue operating margin net income diluted net income per common share total employees period end total average employees total consultants period end total period end quota carrying sales persons excluding managers and inside sales representatives financial condition and liquidity data cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities period end cash flows from operating activities total deferred revenue period end we achieved growth in total revenue during fiscal driven by growth in revenue from software license updates  technical support and services and professional services  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from new software licenses 
the growth in revenue from software license updates  technical support and services and professional services was generated by growth in sales to corporate enterprises  and to a lesser extent  sales to united states government customers 
the decrease in revenue from new software licenses was largely due to a decrease in sales to unites states and international government customers 
while total revenue generated from sales to united states government customers increased in absolute dollars by during fiscal  the percentage of revenue from united states government customers decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal 
table of contents our international revenue increased to  or of total revenue  for fiscal we expect revenue from sales outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
international revenue in fiscal benefited from a more experienced direct sales force and our increased focus on sales to corporate enterprises 
sales to corporate enterprises accounted for the largest portion of our international revenue during fiscal we believe that continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our sales  marketing and customer service functions in international markets 
during fiscal  gross profit increased to  while our gross profit increased in absolute dollars during fiscal  our gross margin decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in our gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue of  in fiscal  which is a more profitable source of our revenue 
the decrease in license revenue was largely the result of a decrease in license sales to united states and international government customers  which was partially offset by an increase in license sales to corporate enterprise customers 
as a software company  we believe that our business model has the potential to generate operating margins of or more 
our operating margin decreased to negative during fiscal from positive during fiscal the decrease in operating margin was largely the result of an increase in research and development expenses of  an increase in sales and marketing expenses of  and a decrease in license revenue of  trends that may affect our business and future results while we anticipate a challenging economic environment in the near term  we believe the recent expansion of our network applications portfolio into the appliance based end user monitoring space  recent enhancements to our core software products  such as panorama  and our focus on improving the productivity of our sales force and controlling operating expenses has us well positioned to improve our profitability as compared to fiscal the demand for our software products and related services by corporate enterprise and united states government customers has been much stronger than the demand from service providers and network equipment manufacturers  which is consistent with our expectations 
we believe that lower business activity with service providers and network equipment manufacturers is primarily due to the challenging economy in which these businesses operate  which we expect to continue  at least in the near term 
consequently  our revenue growth and profitability depend  in significant part  upon our ability to sell in a challenging economic environment and the economic health of corporate enterprises and united states government agencies 
we intend to take advantage of our market position and expanded software product portfolio to increase both total revenue and new software license revenue 
we anticipate the following trends and patterns over the next several quarters total revenue 
we currently expect future growth in total revenue to come from sales to corporate enterprise customers and the united states government 
based on historic patterns of demand  we expect revenue from sales to service providers and network equipment manufacturers to fluctuate from quarter to quarter with the potential for periods of declining license revenue 
our ability to increase professional service revenue will depend upon our ability to generate revenue from contracts with the united states government and to attract and retain additional qualified consultants  including those with security clearances 
as a result of these factors  we believe that we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue 
international revenue 
our international sales are affected by the mix of direct and indirect sales channels and our focus on increasing sales to corporate enterprises 
we believe that these factors affect the timing of sales orders as well as our ability to forecast future revenue 
we expect overall international revenue growth in fiscal  however  we expect to continue experiencing quarterly fluctuations of international revenue 

table of contents gross profit margin 
we anticipate modest increases in the cost of professional services primarily from hiring additional consultants to support demand for our services 
our overall gross profit margin will be affected by the profitability of individual consulting engagements as well as the amount of gross profit from the sale of new software licenses and software license updates  technical support and services  which have substantially higher gross margins than the gross margin on professional services revenue 
our ability to increase gross profit margin will depend largely upon our ability to increase revenue generated from the sale of new software licenses  which declined by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development will be required to maintain our competitive position and broaden our software product lines  as well as enhance the features and functionality of our current software products 
we made significant personnel investments in research and development during fiscal we expect that the absolute dollar amount of these expenses will continue to grow but generally decrease as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
our ability to decrease these expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will depend upon increases in our revenue growth  among other factors 
sales and marketing expenses 
we depend upon our direct sales model to generate revenue and believe that increasing the size of our quota carrying sales team is essential for long term growth 
we plan to add quota carrying sales persons during fiscal to pursue our growth strategies 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to sales and marketing in the future 
we made significant personnel investments in sales and marketing during fiscal we expect that the absolute dollar amount of these expenses will continue to grow but generally decrease as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase as we continue to expand our operations  however  we expect the dollar amount of these expenditures to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
our general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal our ability to decrease these expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will depend upon increases in our revenue growth  among other factors 
operating margin 
since a significant portion of our software license arrangements close in the latter part of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in the short term to respond to lower than expected revenue  which would adversely impact our operating margin and earnings 
our operating margin decreased to negative during fiscal from positive during fiscal we remain committed to increasing profitability and long term growth 
we do not believe that significant changes to our cost structure are necessary at this time  but we intend to closely control expenses and focus on near term increases in profitability by increasing sales of new software licenses 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and 
table of contents deferred revenue  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  software development costs  and income taxes 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from three primary sources new software licenses  software license updates  technical support and services  which include software license update  certain training provided and offered on a when and if available basis to customers  and technical support  and professional services  which include consulting and custom training services for customers without a current maintenance agreement 
we recognize revenue based on the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
new software license revenue new software license revenue represents all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software  and excludes revenue derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates  technical support and services revenue 
our new software license revenue consists of perpetual and term license sales of software products 
for the twelve months ended march   perpetual licenses represented approximately of software license revenue 
new software license revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the software has occurred  iii the software license fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we define each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for license arrangements with end users  it is our customary practice to have a written software license agreement  which is signed by both the end user and us  and a purchase order or equivalent 
a written contract can be executed based on the customer specific format or on the standard shrink wrap software master license agreement 
for those end users who have previously negotiated a software license agreement with us  the initial software license agreement is used as evidence of a written contract 
sales to distributors  resellers  and value added resellers  which we collectively refer to as resellers  are primarily made outside of north america and are evidenced by a master reseller agreement governing the relationship  which is signed by both the reseller and us  together with a purchase order on a transaction by transaction basis 
to further evidence an arrangement  our master reseller agreement requires that the reseller provide us copies of the end user s purchase order and executed copies of the end user s software master license agreements 
delivery has occurred 
physical delivery of our software products to end users or resellers  which are collectively referred to as customers  is generally considered to have occurred upon the transfer of media containing our software products to a common carrier usually fob shipping point based on standard agreement terms 
software products may also be delivered electronically to end users 
electronic delivery is deemed to occur after end users have been provided with access codes that allow them to take immediate possession of the software 
if a software arrangement includes undelivered software products or services that are essential to the functionality of delivered software products  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these software products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to any adjustments or refund of any portion of their license fees paid  acceptance provisions  cancellation privileges  or rights of return 
our normal payment terms for our software products and services currently range from net days to net days and primarily vary based on the country in which an agreement is executed 
payments that extend beyond our normal payment terms from the contract date but that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history 
table of contents on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenue from such arrangements is recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customer s ability to pay 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
in instances when any of the four criteria are not met  we defer recognition of software license revenue until the criteria are met 
when the sale of the software product requires us to make significant enhancements  customization or modifications to the software that are essential to its functionality  software license revenue and consulting fees are recognized using contract accounting under sop we estimate the percentage of completion  under sop  based on its estimate of total hours to complete the project as a percentage of total hours incurred and the estimated hours to complete 
the process of estimation inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of software license revenue and professional services revenue under certain contracts and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements  including skill level and experience of project managers  staff assigned to engagements and continuity and attrition level of professional services staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if it is required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or if it expects to incur a loss on the project 
software license updates  technical support and services revenue software license updates  technical support and services revenue represents fees associated with the sale of license updates  training  and technical support  all provided on a when and if available basis except technical support under our maintenance agreement 
payments for software license updates  technical support and services on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
license updates consist of the right to unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis and are typically entered into in connection with the initial software license purchase 
license updates  technical support and services may be renewed upon expiration of the term 
customers can purchase license updates separately from technical support and services 
revenue from license updates  technical support and services is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which typically include new software licenses  consulting services  training and maintenance agreements sold together  are allocated to each element in the arrangement primarily using the residual method based upon the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
discounts  if any  are applied to the delivered elements  usually software licenses  under the residual method 
for periodic unspecified product updates and technical support agreements  vsoe is based upon either the renewal rate specified in each contract or the price charged when sold separately 
for consulting services and training for customers without a current maintenance agreement  vsoe is based upon the rates charged for these services when sold separately 
if we are unable to establish vsoe for an undelivered post contract support  or pcs  element  for example  in a two year term license where the license term and pcs are coterminous and no pcs renewal period exists  all revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
for income statement classification purposes  our allocation methodology is based on vsoe of fair value for our professional services which is determined by the price charged when sold separately  and the contractually stated renewal rates for our pcs  generally to of the license fee paid on perpetual licenses 
we use the residual method to allocate any remaining arrangement fee to new software license revenue 

table of contents professional services revenue professional services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and training for customers without a current maintenance agreement and is recognized as the services are performed 
when we enter into consulting service arrangements that include significant modifications to the software that are essential to the customer s use and the arrangement is bundled with software  revenue under the entire arrangement is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
for income statement classification purposes  we have developed a revenue allocation methodology for these arrangements that is consistent with the residual method used  and described under sop  when services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
in these circumstances  revenue is allocated to the various elements of the arrangement based on our vsoe of fair value and the residual amount is allocated to new software license revenue 
we sell new software licenses  license updates  technical support and services agreements to distributors at predetermined prices 
sales to distributors are not contingent upon resale of the software to the end user 
in most cases  we provide license updates  technical support and services agreements directly to distributors and the distributors provide support to the end customer 
revenue from sales to distributors is recorded at the amounts charged to the distributor and in the same manner as new software license  license updates  technical support and services sales sold through our direct sales force 
amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are classified as deferred revenue 
income taxes 
effective april   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
as a result of the implementation  we recognized a increase to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the portion of the increase that was accounted for as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet was the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of april  was of this total  net of federal benefit on state issues represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
at march   the gross unrecognized benefit was  of which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows unrecognized tax benefits at april  gross increases tax positions in prior period gross decreases tax positions in prior period gross increases current period tax positions settlements lapse of statute of limitations foreign currency translation adjustment unrecognized tax benefits at march  the following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open under the statute of limitations and are subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions that we operate australia fy fy belgium fy fy france fy fy germany fy fy united kingdom fy fy united states fy fy united states fy fy maryland fy fy new york fy fy 
table of contents our continuing practice is to recognize interest  if any  related to income tax matters in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations and penalties as part of general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
in conjunction with the adoption of fin  we recognized and for the payment of interest and penalties  respectively  at april  which is included in accrued interest on the balance sheet 
during fiscal  we recognized in potential interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions 
the total accrued interest and accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions at march  is and  respectively 
we believe it is reasonably possible that significant changes in the liability for uncertain tax positions will occur in the next twelve months as a result of final decisions related to the voluntary payments of our state and local income taxes and lapse of statute of limitations 
in the aggregate  we believe the liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by in the next twelve months 
the income tax provision includes income taxes currently payable plus the net change during the year in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the differences between the carrying value under gaap and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
judgments and estimates are required in the calculation of the deferred tax assets  valuation allowance  accrual of contingencies  research and development tax credits  and foreign tax credits 
stock based compensation 
on april   we adopted sfas r  which revised sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
prior to fiscal year and the adoption of sfas r  we followed the intrinsic value method of accounting for our stock based employee compensation arrangements as defined by accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have identified our accounting for stock based compensation as a critical accounting policy  as this policy affects the reported amount of stock based compensation expense and involves the use of management s judgments and estimates 
stock based compensation expense in connection with our application of sfas r was and  for fiscal and  respectively 
sfas r requires an entity to recognize an expense within its income statement for all share based payment arrangements  which includes employee stock option plans  restricted stock grants  and employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
we have elected to continue straight line amortization of stock based compensation expense for the entire award over the service period since the awards have only service conditions and graded vesting 
our stock options and nonvested stock do not contain performance conditions 
there have been no modifications to awards in or we adopted sfas r under the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after april  as well as to the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of april  stock based compensation for unvested awards granted prior to april   is based upon the grant date fair value of such compensation as determined under pro forma provisions of sfas no our stock option programs are accounted for as equity awards 
the expense is based on the grant date fair value of the options granted  and is recognized over the requisite service period 
to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  consistent with that used for pro forma disclosure under sfas no the black scholes model estimates the per share fair value of an option on its date of grant based on the following the option s exercise price  the price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  the estimated dividend yield  a risk free interest rate  the estimated option term  and the expected volatility 
for the risk free interest rate  we use a us treasury bond due in a number of years equal to the option s expected term 
to estimate expected volatility  we analyzed the historic volatility of our common stock 
there were no stock options granted in fiscal 
table of contents compensation cost for stock option grants is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 
compensation cost is recognized within the income statement in the same expense line as the cash compensation paid to the respective employees 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options 
the impact on compensation costs due to changes in the expected forfeiture rate will be recognized in the period that they become known 
as of march   nonvested stock based deferred compensation associated with stock options totaled  which we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
our restricted stock grants are accounted for as equity awards 
the expense is based on the price of our common stock  and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we did not grant any restricted stock prior to february the restricted stock agreements do not contain any post vesting restrictions 
we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options 
as of march   nonvested stock based deferred compensation associated with restricted stock totaled  which we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  provides all eligible employees to collectively purchase up to a total of shares of our common stock 
an employee may authorize a payroll deduction up to a maximum of of his or her compensation during the plan period 
the purchase price for each share purchased is the lesser of of the closing price of the common stock on the first or last day of the plan period 
the plan period for the espp ends in january and july of each year 
the expense is calculated based on the difference between the fair market value of the shares purchased at the close of each plan period and the discounted price paid by the employee  and that expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the plan period 
as of march   nonvested stock based deferred compensation associated with espp totaled and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
auction rate securities 
as of march   we held auction rate securities  or ars  totaling  at par value  which are classified as available for sale securities and short term and long term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet 
contractual maturities for these ars extend through november with an interest rate reset date approximately every days 
the ars are primarily collateralized by united states government backed student loans and were rated aaa at march  historically  the carrying value of ars approximated fair value due to the frequent successful auctions that reset the interest rates 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  our ars have experienced failed auctions 
while we continue to earn and receive interest on these marketable securities at the maximum contractual rate  we determined that the estimated fair value of these ars no longer approximate par value 
since there is little or no active market data for our ars  we developed our own assumptions to determine the fair value of the securities 
we assumed that the fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received if we sold the ars in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we prepared our fair value analysis to determine the exit price by focusing on the structure of each ars  the collateral underlying each ars  the cash flow characteristics  and the current trading environment of such securities 
we also considered the valuation prepared for us by a third party valuation firm 
with regard to the structure of each ars  we charted the cash flows pertaining to the ars and modeled the net present value 
while we believe that the estimates we used are reasonable  should any of these factors change  our estimates may also change  which could affect the valuation of our ars 
in addition  we performed extensive research on the collateral underlying the ars and the trading environment for such financial products 
it is our view that a number of factors have contributed to the recent market disruption real and perceived decline in value of collateralized assets and other financial instruments  increased defaults on home mortgages and bankruptcies  tightening of credit among lenders  increasing commodity prices and the weakening of the united states dollar  and fears of a united states recession 
based on our analysis and our belief that the ars are of high credit quality  we determined that the fair value of the ars at march  was  and recorded a temporary impairment charge of we 
table of contents currently intend  and believe we have the ability  to hold the ars for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in the market 
accordingly  we believe that the impairment is temporary 
we recorded the temporary impairment charge to other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also classified  of the ars as long term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for the limited circumstances when the customer disputes the amounts due us 
our methodology for determining this allowance requires significant estimates 
in estimating the allowance  we consider the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  should any of these factors change  our estimates may also change  which could affect the amount of our future allowance for doubtful accounts as well as future operating income 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances could be required 
as of march  and  accounts receivable totaled  and  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of and  respectively 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 
we account for our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of acquired technology related to our acquisitions of a software product for modeling voice communications in december  altaworks in october  and purchased technology we purchased from radview software  ltd 
in december  sqmworks  inc in april and network physics  inc in october our intangible assets also consist of customer relationships and acquired workforce we purchased from network physics  inc related to the purchase of specified assets of network physics in october the acquired and purchased technology are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives of three to five years 
our customer relationship and workforce intangible assets we purchased from network physics  inc are amortized on an accelerated depreciation basis over their expected useful lives of four and one half years and five years  respectively 
we use the projected discounted cash flow method in valuing our acquired technology and purchased customer relationships using certain assumptions including revenue growth  cost levels  present value discount rate  and working capital requirements 
we use the lower of the amount of cash paid or the present value of projected discounted cash flows to value purchased technology 
the workforce asset associated with the purchase of specified assets of network physics  inc was valued on a replacement cost basis 
while we believe the assumptions used to value our acquired technology related to acquisitions are reasonable  actual results will likely differ from those assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to change for a variety of internal and external factors 
we will periodically review the value of acquired technology and purchased intangible assets for reasonableness in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if changes in our assumptions at the time of future periodic reviews indicate that the carrying value of our acquired technology and purchased intangible assets exceeds their fair value and we determine that carrying amounts can not be recovered  it would result in impairment losses 
as of march  and  intangible assets totaled  and  net of accumulated amortization of  and  respectively 
no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for acquisitions exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we perform an annual review no later than our fourth quarter to identify any facts or circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
the review is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections and the market capitalization of our common stock 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of march  and and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment 
as of march  and  goodwill was  no impairment losses have been recorded to date 

table of contents accounting for software development costs 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to our customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the working model stage

provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates were negative  positive  and positive for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in book income and an increase in permanent book to tax differences such as tax exempt interest income 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of the reduced benefit of research and development tax credits and adjusting projected foreign tax credits and projected research and development tax credits to the actual amount of the credits computed in conjunction with completing and filing our fiscal tax return in december of fiscal the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and varies from period to period due principally to the amount of income before taxes from various tax jurisdictions  tax exempt interest income  foreign tax expense  and the amount of tax credits available to us in each period from incremental research expenditures 
future provisions for taxes will depend  among other things  on the mix and amount of worldwide income  the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions and the amount of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits and other items for which we are eligible

during the three months ended march   the auction rate securities became subject to adverse market conditions  and the liquidity typically associated with the financial markets for such instruments became restricted as auctions for auction rate securities began to fail 
as a result of the failed auctions  we classified  of our auction rate securities as long term marketable securities  and we determined that the auction rate securities were temporarily impaired and recorded a temporary impairment charge in other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet of at march  cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from net income  as adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense  tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in cash resulting from an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  deferred revenue and accounts payable and accrued expenses  which was partially offset by an decrease in cash resulting from a decrease in net income and an increase in prepaid expenses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risks and believe that the risk is minimal 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our cash equivalents  marketable securities or notes payable 
at march   we had  in cash and cash equivalents and  in short term and long term marketable securities 
prior to march   the long term marketable securities were classified as short term marketable securities 
the long term marketable securities consisted of highly rated auction rate securities with maturities in excess of one year 
the majority of these auction rate securities were collateralized by united states government backed student loans and were rated aaa at march  during the three months ended march   the auction rate securities became subject to adverse market conditions  and the liquidity typically associated with the financial markets for such instruments became restricted as auctions began to fail 
as a result of the failed auctions  we determined that the auction rate securities were temporarily impaired and recorded a impairment charge at march  based on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of march   a one percentage point increase or decrease in the interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately a majority of our revenue transactions outside the united states are denominated in local currencies and the majority of operating expenses associated with our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies  therefore  our results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound and the european union euro 
we currently do not hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
due to the limited nature of our foreign operations  we do not believe that a change in exchange rates would have a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations
