item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
executive summary our business we are an international offshore energy company that provides reservoir development solutions and other contracting services to the open energy market as well as to our own oil and gas properties 
our oil and gas business is a prospect generation  exploration  development and production company 
employing our own key services and methodologies we seek to lower finding and development costs  relative to industry norms 
industry overview and major influences the offshore oil and gas industry originated in the early s as producers began to explore and develop the new frontier of offshore fields 
the industry has grown significantly since the s with service providers taking on greater roles on behalf of the producers 
industry standards were established during this period largely in response to the emergence of the north sea as a major province leading the way into a new hostile frontier 
the methodology of these standards was driven by the requirement of mitigating the risk of developing relatively large reservoirs in a then challenging environment 
these standards are still largely adhered to today for all developments even if they are small and the frontier is more understood 
there are factors we believe will influence the industry in the coming years increasing world demand for oil and natural gas  global production rates peaking  globalization of the natural gas market  increasing number of mature and small reservoirs  increasing ratio of contribution to global production from marginal fields  increasing offshore activity  and increasing number of subsea developments 
our business is substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and natural gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and natural gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration  drilling and production operations 
the level of capital expenditure generally depends on the prevailing views of future oil and natural gas prices  which are influenced by numerous factors  including but not limited to worldwide economic activity  
table of contents demand for oil and natural gas  especially in the united states  china and india  economic and political conditions in the middle east and other oil producing regions  actions taken by the opec  the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  the cost of offshore exploration for and production and transportation of oil and gas  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain external capital for exploration  development and production operations  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  technological advances affecting energy exploration production transportation and consumption  weather conditions  environmental and other governmental regulations  and tax policies 
activity summary over the last few years we continued to evolve the helix model by completing a variety of transactions and events that have had  and we believe will continue to have  significant impacts on our results of operations and financial condition 
in  we substantially increased the size of our shelf contracting fleet and deepwater pipelay fleet through the acquisition of assets from torch offshore  inc and acergy us inc for a combined purchase price of million 
we also acquired a significant mature property package on the gulf of mexico ocs from murphy oil corporation for million cash and assumption of abandonment liability of million 
finally  we established our reservoir and well technology services group through the acquisition of helix energy limited for million and the assumption of million of liabilities 
in  we acquired remington  an exploration  development and production company  for approximately billion in cash and stock and the assumption of million of liabilities 
we changed our name from cal dive international  inc to helix energy solutions group  inc  leaving the cal dive name in our shelf contracting subsidiary  and in december completed a carve out initial public offering of that company  selling a stake and receiving pre tax net proceeds of million from cal dive and a pre tax dividend of million from additional borrowings under the cal dive revolving credit facility 
during we committed to four capital projects which will significantly expand our contracting services capabilities conversion of the caesar into a deepwater pipelay vessel  upgrading of the q to include drilling capability  conversion of a ferry vessel into a dp floating production unit helix producer i and construction of a multi service dp dive support well intervention vessel for the north sea well enhancer 
during  we successfully completed the drilling of exploratory wells in our owned noonan and danny prospects located in garden banks block in the gulf of mexico 
first production for noonan is expected in the second half of and danny is expected in the first half of in june  cal dive and horizon announced that they had entered into an agreement under which cal dive would acquire horizon for approximately million 
cdi issued an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock and paid approximately million in cash in the merger 
the cash portion of the merger consideration was paid from cdi s cash on hand and from borrowings under its new million credit facility consisting of a million senior secured term loan and a million senior secured revolving credit facility  each of which is non recourse to helix 
as a result of cdi s equity issued  we recorded a million gain  net of million of taxes 
the gain was calculated as the difference in the value of our investment in cdi immediately before and after cdi s stock issuance 
the transaction closed on december  
table of contents results of operations our operations are conducted through the following lines of business contracting services operations and oil and gas operations 
we have disaggregated our contracting services operations into three reportable segments in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  our reportable segments consist of the following contracting services  shelf contracting  production facilities  and oil and gas 
contracting services operations include services such as deepwater pipelay  well operations  robotics and reservoir and well technology services 
shelf contracting operations represent cal dive  in which we owned at december  all material intercompany transactions between the segments have been eliminated in our consolidated results of operations

revenues 
during the year ended december   our revenues increased by as compared to contracting services revenues increased primarily due to improved contract pricing for the pipelay  well operations and rov divisions 
shelf contracting revenues increased primarily as a result of the initial deployment of certain assets we acquired through the torch  acergy and fraser acquisitions that came into service subsequent to the first quarter of as well as the horizon assets acquired in late these increases were partially offset by two vessels cdi did not operate one owned and one chartered in that were in operation in and an increased number of out of service days for regulatory drydock and vessel upgrades for certain vessels in our shelf contracting segment 
oil and gas revenues increased during as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increases in oil and natural gas production 
the production volume increase of over was mainly attributable to properties acquired in connection with the remington acquisition  which closed on july  gross profit 
the contracting services gross profit increase was primarily attributable to improved contract pricing for the pipelay  well operations and rov divisions 
the gross profit increase within shelf contracting was primarily attributable to increased gross profit derived from the initial deployment of certain assets we acquired subsequent to the first quarter  offset by increased out of service days referred to above  lower vessel utilization as a result of seasonal weather in the fourth quarter  and increased depreciation and deferred drydock amortization 
the oil and gas gross profit decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the following factors impairment expense of approximately million all recorded in fourth quarter related to our proved oil and gas properties primarily as a result of downward reserve revisions and weak end of life well performance in some of our domestic properties  an increase of million in depletion expense in because of higher overall production based on a full year of activity from the remington acquisition as compared to only half a year of impact in 
table of contents including approximately million of increased fourth quarter depletion due to certain producing properties experiencing significant proved reserve declines  approximately million of impairment expense million in fourth quarter related to our unproved properties primarily due to management s assessment that exploration activities for certain properties will not commence prior to the respective lease expiration dates  approximately million additional impairment expense in fourth quarter  as we increased our future abandonment liability at december  for work yet to be done for certain properties  partially offset by estimated insurance recoveries of million related to properties damaged by hurricanes katrina and rita  approximately million of plug and abandonment overruns related to properties damaged by the hurricanes  partially offset by insurance recoveries of million million of overruns in fourth quarter  offset by million of insurance recoveries  the gross profit decrease was partially offset by lower dry hole expense in of million  of which million was related to our south marsh island well  as compared to million dry hole expense in related to the tulane prospect and two deep shelf wells commenced by remington prior to the acquisition 
as a result of our unsuccessful development well in january on devil s island  we expect to expense an additional million in the first quarter of costs incurred as of december  related to this well were charged to income in and were included in the impairment expense described above 
gain on sale of assets  net 
gain on sale of assets  net  increased by million during as compared to on september   we sold a working interest in the phoenix oilfield green canyon blocks  the boris oilfield green canyon block and the little burn oilfield green canyon block to sojitz for a cash payment of million and recognized a gain of million in we also recognized the following gains in million related to the sale of a mobile offshore production unit  million related to the sale or interest in camelot  and million related to the sale of assets owned by cdi 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses of million were million higher than the million incurred in the increase was due primarily to higher overhead to support our growth and increased incentive compensation accruals 
further  in june  cdi recorded a million charge for a cash settlement with the department of justice 
selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were for both and equity in earnings of investments  net of impairment charge 
equity in earnings of investments increased by million during as compared to equity in earnings related to our investment in independence hub increased million as we reached mechanical completion in march and began receiving demand fees and tariffs as production began in the third quarter 
in addition  equity in earnings of our investment in deepwater gateway increased by million in as compared to due to higher throughput at the marco polo tlp 
these increases were offset by second quarter equity losses from cdi s investment in otsl and a related non cash asset impairment charge together totaling million 
net interest expense and other 
we reported net interest and other expense of million in as compared to million in the prior year 
gross interest expense of million during was higher than the million incurred in as a result of our term loan and revolving loans  which closed in july  and cdi s revolving credit facility  which closed in december offsetting the increase in interest expense was million of capitalized interest and million of interest income in  compared with million of capitalized interest and million of interest income in the same prior year period 
we expect interest expense to increase in as a result of the senior unsecured notes we issued in december and the term loan cdi entered into as a result of the horizon acquisition
