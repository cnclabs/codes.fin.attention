the bay club was closed in august and the new restaurant is expected to open in summer sales of non core property in  we sold approximately acres of upcountry maui land in five land sales transactions 
these properties primarily consist of land that was deemed unsuitable for precision cultivation of pineapple and were also not suitable for creating new holistic development communities 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated years ended december  change in millions  except share amounts consolidated revenues net income basic earnings per common share we reported net income of million for compared to million for for  basic earnings per common share were compared to for consolidated revenues of million were or million lower in compared to the reduction in revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in agriculture segment revenues as a result of the restructuring that began in the second quarter of and to a million decrease in the resort segment revenues  largely because of the closure of the village course in february  and the temporary closure of other facilities during in  we recognized over million in pre tax profit from the sale of non core land parcels and the land underlying the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel 
we also recognized over million of income from our investment in kapalua bay holdings  llc 
losses from the agriculture and resort segments largely offset much of these gains 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million compared to million for the major components of the difference in general and administrative expenses were as follows years ended december  change in millions salaries and wages employee incentives and stock compensation professional and other outside services depreciation and asset write offs employee severance expense other net total the reduction in salaries and wages in compared to is due primarily to agriculture re training charges that are included in at the end of june  we began to operate our new fresh fruit packing facility  which is less labor intensive 
in  some of the agriculture segment employees were taken out of operations and retrained for other work as the operations moved toward a less labor intensive process and  in  we incurred employee severance charges of million as a result of the reduction in the agriculture segment work force 
the increase in professional services in primarily reflects increases in actuarial services  largely because of the restructuring of the agriculture business in in  we also incurred outside consultant costs to evaluate and manage construction issues on our kahului properties 
the increase in employee incentives and stock compensation was primarily due to restricted stock vesting in for certain officers and a payment of million to david c 
cole  our chairman  president ceo because of an amendment to mr 
cole s stock option agreement with the company that reduced the value of the stock options 
the stock option agreement was amended to eliminate adverse tax consequences to our chairman imposed by section a of the internal revenue code 
the reduction in depreciation expense charged to general and administrative expense is primarily due to acceleration of depreciation charges in for some of our agriculture segment assets because of changes in our business and acceleration of depreciation charges for our accounting systems that were replaced in general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to our operating segments 
such allocations are made on the basis of our management s evaluation of services provided to the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for interest incurred in was  of which  was capitalized to construction projects 
capital projects in included the honolua store renovation  the kapalua mountain activity center  and planning  design and entitlement work for various capital projects at kapalua resort 
in  interest incurred was  of which  was capitalized to construction projects 
capital projects under construction in included honolua ridge phase ii  honolua village at kapalua resort  the fresh fruit packing facility and offices  and replacement of our accounting systems 
our effective interest rate on borrowings was in compared to in agriculture years ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment produced an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for were million or lower than  primarily due to a reduction in sales of processed products 
the principal reason for the increased operating loss is due to net charges totaling approximately million that were recorded in related to the restructuring of our pineapple operations 
in addition  the operating losses in reflect the time related constraints to restructuring our pineapple operations  such as the growing period of our pineapple crop 
effective as of june   we ceased the production of substantially all solid packed pineapple products note to consolidated financial statements 
with the cessation of solid pack canned products  we began to focus our business on the sale of fresh premium pineapple 
results for included million of accelerated depreciation charges related to assets where the estimated useful lives were reduced because of changes in our pineapple operations  million of employee severance cost  million of charges related to re training employees  and  of material and supply write offs 
these agriculture segment charges in were related to the move to the new fresh processing facility that went into operation in july fresh and processed operations the case volume of fresh pineapple sales was lower by for and revenue per case sold was higher by in compared to reflecting higher per unit sales revenues 
improved pricing was due to improved fruit quality in the lower case sales volume in reflects premature ripening of fruit in  which also produces lower quality fruit 
revenues from fresh pineapple sales represented approximately of the agriculture segment net sales for  compared to approximately for  reflecting the refocusing of our business on the fresh fruit market 
the case volume of processed pineapple sales was lower for as compared to primarily reflecting our plans to cease substantially all solid pack production after june  the average sales prices for our processed pineapple products decreased by approximately for compared to  primarily because we sold relatively more juice in  which has a lower sales value than canned fruit 
the agriculture segment cost of sales was lower by approximately in compared to as a result of lower sales volume of processed product 
per unit cost of sales was higher as a result of significantly lower canned product production due to the discontinuation of processing and selling solid pack pineapple 
shipping and marketing cost was approximately the same in as compared to as a result of higher per unit shipping costs being more than offset by lower sales volume 
per unit shipping costs were higher because of higher warehousing costs and higher ocean and surface transportation costs primarily reflecting higher fuel costs 
resort years ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for resort segment revenues were million or lower for compared to hotel and condominium room occupancies at the kapalua resort and  to a somewhat lesser extent for maui in general  largely drive resort activity as reflected by increased golf play and merchandise sales 
in early april  the kapalua bay hotel held its final guest night and the hotel was permanently closed  resulting in approximately fewer rooms available at the kapalua resort 
in addition  the room ritz carlton  kapalua hotel closed in july for extensive renovations 
the hotel partially re opened in december as expected  the reduction in available rooms has negatively affected the number of paid rounds of golf and retail sales 
the closure of the village course at the end of february and closure of the back nine of the bay course for a comprehensive re seeding of the greens in august also had a negative impact on resort operating results 
the bay course re opened in december  but the renovation will continue in and on the final greens without a course closure 
golf  retail and villas revenues from golf operations and paid rounds of golf both decreased by approximately for compared to average green and cart fees increased by approximately in compared to resort retail sales for were approximately lower than in addition to the closure of facilities at kapalua resort as mentioned above  retail sales were negatively affected by lower average square footage of retail space in reflecting the closure in may of our logo shop  kids shop and home store comprising approximately  square feet in the kapalua shops following the closure of the adjacent kapalua bay hotel for the development of the residences at kapalua bay  and the closure of our  square foot kapalua collections in our honolua village center in july to make room for a resort wide welcoming  information and real estate sales center 
revenues from the kapalua villas were approximately lower in compared to  reflecting a decrease in occupied rooms partially offset by a higher average room rate 
the lower occupancy rate appears to be a trend throughout the maui travel markets and was exacerbated by the closure of the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel  which is used as an amenity by our kapalua villas guests 
there were approximately fewer rooms available in partially reflecting units under renovation under our kapalua gold program to upgrade and standardize the units in our rental program 
community development years ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating profit the community development segment reported an operating profit of million for compared to million for revenues from this operating segment of million in were  higher than revenues and operating profit for include our sale of the land underlying the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel in march  which resulted in revenues and operating profit of approximately million see note to consolidated financial statements 
our equity in the income of kapalua bay holdings  llc was million in compared to a loss of million in in  the joint venture began to recognize revenues and profits on the percentage of completion method from the whole and fractional residential condominiums 
the percentage of completion of the six residential buildings in this project ranged from to as of the end of in connection with profit recognition under the percentage of completion method  we began to recognize a proportionate amount of the unrealized appreciation of the fair value of the land and other non monetary contributions and other deferred costs related to the joint venture 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
real estate sales our honolua ridge phase ii subdivision consists of agricultural zoned lots  which began selling in august through the end of  lot sales have closed escrow  eight of which closed in revenues of million were recognized in compared to revenues of million from this project in in  we were accounting for revenues and profit from honolua ridge phase ii on the percentage of completion method and the project was substantially complete as of december  in  we sold approximately acres of upcountry maui property in five land sales transactions and recognized revenues of million and a pre tax gain of approximately million from these land sales 
in  we recognized revenues of million and a pre tax gain of million from the sale of approximately  acres of upcountry maui land 
the land sold in and had previously been earmarked as non core to our strategic plans 
real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors 
results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends for this segment 
comparison of years ended december  and consolidated years ended december  change in millions  except per share amounts consolidated revenues net income earnings per common share we reported net income of million per share for compared to net income of million per share for consolidated revenues were million for  a decrease of from million for the reduction in revenues in was due to a million decrease from the agriculture segment  million from the community development segment  partially offset by a million increase from the resort segment

these employees were removed from the pineapple operations in connection with the transition to a less labor intensive operation that is more focused on fresh fruit 
the remaining increase in salaries and wages were the result of increases in personnel and wage adjustments 
the increase in employee severance cost reflects the reduction in the agriculture segment work force in september and october of  severance accruals for the planned closure of the village course that occurred on february  and management changes in the decrease in professional and other outside services primarily reflects costs incurred in to maintain and adjust the accounting system that was being used by our agriculture segment 
a decision was made in the fourth quarter of to replace accounting information technology systems and standardize our primary accounting systems and processes used by all of our businesses 
in addition  the decrease in professional and other outside services costs in is due to higher costs incurred in to prepare us for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of in  after planning the construction of a fresh fruit packing facility adjacent to our kahului cannery  we changed the estimated useful life of the affected assets and began the acceleration of depreciation of those assets 
plans regarding the construction of a new cannery and can plant were revised in january  and accordingly  we prospectively revised depreciation charges on the cannery and plant 
in  we began the execution of our plans to replace all of our accounting systems and we began the acceleration of depreciation for those assets 
these accounting system assets were fully depreciated in the first half of  as the new accounting system was placed in service as of the beginning of the third quarter of in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for the write off of inventory  machinery  equipment  and deferred costs primarily because of changes in our businesses 
the reduction in medical insurance premium expense in primarily reflects the reduction in the agriculture segment work force 
general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with our management s evaluation of the services provided to the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for interest incurred in was  of which  was capitalized to construction projects 
our major capital projects under construction in included honolua ridge phase ii  honolua village at kapalua resort  the fresh fruit packing facility and offices  and replacement of our accounting systems 
in  interest incurred was  of which  was capitalized 
our effective interest rate on borrowings was in compared to in agriculture years ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for were million or lower than primarily due to lower case volume of processed pineapple sales that was only partially offset by higher case volume of fresh pineapple sales 
operating losses reported by the agriculture segment for and include million and million  respectively  for asset write offs and accelerated depreciation charges related to assets where the estimated useful lives were reduced because of changes in our pineapple operations 
the agriculture segment also recorded million for employee severance cost in primarily as a result of production efficiencies gained by the operation of the new fresh fruit packing plant and charges of  related to materials and supplies inventories that were considered obsolete with the change to the new packing facility that went into operation at the end of june in addition  the agriculture segment recorded million of charges related to re training employees in compared to million of re training charges in processed and fresh operations the case volume of fresh pineapple sales increased by and the average revenue per case of fresh pineapple sold increased by less than in compared to revenues from fresh pineapple sales were approximately of the agriculture segment product revenues for  compared to approximately for the case volume of processed pineapple sales decreased by in as compared to primarily reflecting our strategy to reduce supply to selected retail market segments 
the agriculture segment cost of sales was lower by in compared to  primarily reflecting the reduced sales volume of processed pineapple partially offset by the increased sales volume of fresh pineapple 
the average per unit cost of sales for processed pineapple was higher in compared to because of the reduced tonnage of fruit being processed  while the average per unit cost of sales for fresh pineapple was lower primarily reflecting efficiencies that the operation is beginning to realize with the operation of the new fresh packing facility 
in and  there were partial liquidations of lifo last in  first out inventories for our processed pineapple products  resulting in lower costs from prior years being charged to cost of sales 
based on current costs  the operating loss for the agriculture segment for and would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
agriculture segment shipping and marketing costs decreased by about in compared to  principally reflecting a lower volume of processed pineapple  partially offset by higher average cost for shipping and higher volume of fresh fruit shipments 
the average shipping and selling cost for our fresh pineapple was lower in compared to primarily because in we shipped approximately of our fresh product to the mainland united states by ocean transportation as compared to air freight  which is more costly compared to in changes in our cultivation practices  harvesting methods  and post harvest handling have extended the shelf life of fresh fruit products enabling us to increase our reliance on surface transport to reach north american markets 
resort years ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to million for resort segment revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of  as a result of higher revenues from the kapalua villas and from our golf operations primarily due to rate increases 
the operating loss for includes  of employee severance expense  primarily reflecting the planned february  closure of the village course and management changes 
the operating loss for also includes higher expenses in particular for advertising and promotions  utilities and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the plantation course was closed from april through july of for renovation of the greens and bunkers 
the closure of that golf course for four months in negatively impacted the operating results from resort operations in compared to hotel and condominium room occupancies at the kapalua resort and  to a somewhat lesser extent  for maui in general  largely drive resort activity as reflected by increased golf play and merchandise sales 
in early april  the kapalua bay hotel held its final guest night and the hotel was permanently closed 
this closure resulted in approximately fewer available rooms at kapalua resort and as expected  negatively affected the number of paid rounds of golf and retail sales in golf  retail and villas revenues from golf operations increased by for compared to overall  paid rounds of golf decreased by  and average green and cart fees increased by in compared to resort retail sales for were about lower than sales in lower retail sales reflect the closure of the kapalua bay hotel and the closure of our logo shop  kids shop and home store in may  and our kapalua collection store in march these shops were adjacent to the hotel and represented approximately  square feet of retail area 
in mid october  our new  square foot kapalua collections store featuring upscale resort wear opened at the honolua village center in our central resort area 
revenues from the kapalua villas increased in compared to  primarily reflecting an increase in the average room rates  partially offset by a lower number of occupied rooms 
the increase in average room rates was due to a greater number of direct bookings and a more aggressive pricing strategy across all channels and product categories 
community development years ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating profit the community development segment reported an operating profit of million for compared to million for revenues from this operating segment were million for compared to million for in  we recognized revenues of million and a pre tax gain of million from the sale of approximately  acres of non core upcountry maui land
