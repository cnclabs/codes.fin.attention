as a result of that storm  many counties in kansas  including some counties where the company has wells  lost power for the entire month of january 
producing wells in those counties were unable to produce without electricity to run the well pumps during the power outage 
consequently in january the company saw production and revenue decline from monthly levels in late none of the company s producing wells were physically damaged by the ice storm or by non no cash dividends have been declared or paid by the company for the periods presented 
on july   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

the company has expended approximately million of these funds subsequent to year end on the methane project and completing the ten well program 
production during the absence of power  but the storm did substantially adversely impact production levels and sales in the first two months of while at the same time causing an increase in expenses 
eventually new poles and lines were rebuilt on a locally massive scale and electrical power was restored  and the company experienced a rebound of production commencing in march in the company produced  barrels of oil in kansas compared to  in  a decrease of  barrels for the year 
additionally  the wells in the eight well program former series a reached the reversionary flip point in april this is the point at which the company started receiving of the participant s interest plus our original interest of for an approximate total net interest to the company equal to an interest

the other three wells that were drilled in were then completed in in march  the tenth and final well in the ten well program was both drilled and completed as a producer 
as of the date of this report  nine of ten wells drilled in the ten well program have been completed as producers and are producing approximately barrels per day 
during the first half of the company expects the reversionary flip point for the twelve well program former series b now converted to a six well program  to be achieved 
gas prices received for sales of gas from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in  per mcf in and per mcf in oil prices received for sales of oil from the swan creek field averaged per barrel in  and per barrel in  and 
per barrel in production costs and taxes in increased to  from  in and  in the difference is due to increased work overs to increase production  increased taxes  and overall cost increases of supplies in the industry

actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers 
natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the customers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  day rate rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized 
no ceiling write downs were recorded in  or oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  were determined by laroche petroleum consultants  ltd 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells 
management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs  discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 
quarterly  management accretes the discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority 
the assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position  without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged 
if an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely to be recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority  is recorded 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
consistent with the requirements of fin  the company adopted fin on january  the company does not expect the interpretation will have an impact on its results of operations or financial position

in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
under the standard  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
it clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company continues to evaluate the impact the adoption of this statement could have on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities as amended sfas 
sfas permits entities to elect to report eligible financial instruments at fair value subject to conditions stated in the pronouncement including adoption of sfas discussed above

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company did not enter into any hedging agreements in to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations

some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
