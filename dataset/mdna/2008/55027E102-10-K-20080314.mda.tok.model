table of contents part i item business overview luminex corporation develops  manufactures and sells proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences industry 
the life sciences industry depends on a broad range of tests  called bioassays  to perform diagnostic tests  discover and develop new drugs and identify genes 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  protein analysis and biomedical research 
our products are described below under products 
luminex has established a position in the life sciences industry by developing and delivering products that meet customer and partner needs in specific market segments 
these needs are addressed by our proprietary technology  xmap technology  which allows the end user in a laboratory to perform biological testing in a multiplexed format 
multiplexing allows for many different laboratory results to be generated from one sample at one time 
this is important because our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
until the availability of multiplexing technology such as xmap  the laboratory professional had to perform one test on one sample in a sequential manner  and if additional testing was required on that sample  a second procedure would be performed to generate the second result  and so on until all the necessary tests were performed 
by using xmap technology  these end users have the opportunity to become more efficient by generating multiple simultaneous results per sample 
using the products luminex has available today  up to simultaneous analyte results can be generated from a single sample 
with products we are currently developing  the capacity of potential simultaneous analytes may increase significantly  and provide the company with the ability to address unmet customer and partner needs in existing and new market segments 
luminex has adopted a business model built around strategic partnerships 
information about our strategy is described under business strategy 
the company has licensed our xmap technology to other companies  who then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that they sell to the end user 
luminex develops and manufactures the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sells these products to our partners 
our partners sell xmap instrumentation  xmap based reagent consumable products or xmap based testing services  which run on the xmap instrumentation  to the end user customer  typically a testing laboratory 
when our partners sell an xmap based consumable product or xmap based testing service to their customer  luminex obtains a royalty on the sales from the partner 
the company was founded on this model  and our success to date has been due to this model 
as of the december   luminex had approximately strategic partners  of which have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our technology  and these partners have sold and placed  xmap based instruments in laboratories worldwide 
a fundamental component of the company s strategy over the past two years has been to augment the partnership model with a distribution model  designed to take advantage of our increasing installed base of xmap based instrumentation 
the company established the luminex bioscience group  which we refer to as lbg  in  with the charter of developing products that would be complementary to our partners products  that we would take responsibility for manufacturing on their behalf and that our partners would then sell to the end user  thereby leveraging both our existing distribution channels and our existing installed base of instrumentation 
lbg introduced their first two products in late  on schedule  and launched several assay products in 
table of contents on march   we completed our acquisition of tm bioscience  now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and known as luminex molecular diagnostics  of toronto  canada 
tm bioscience was a molecular diagnostics company 
tm bioscience had focused its resources on building a commercialization engine for the design  development  manufacture  marketing and selling of genetic tests  also referred to as dna based tests  nucleic acid tests or molecular diagnostics

questions regarding the public reference room may be directed to the sec at industry background the life sciences industry uses bioassays to detect the presence and characteristics of certain biochemicals  proteins or nucleic acids in a sample 
drug discovery  genetic analysis  pharmacogenomics  clinical diagnostics and general biomedical research all use bioassays 
for example  bioassays can be used to measure the attraction  or affinity  between a chemical compound and a disease target for drug discovery and development  assist physicians in prescribing the appropriate tailored drug therapy based on the patient s unique genetic makeup  a process known as pharmacogenetics  detect genetic variations  such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  and measure the presence and quantity of biochemicals in a patient s blood  other body fluid or tissue to assist physicians in diagnosing  treating or monitoring disease conditions 
the life sciences customer can purchase bioassays in the form of complete off the shelf kits  develop them internally or utilize a customized service to meet their specific needs 
although it is important to note that our xmap technology is relevant to only a subset of the total life sciences market  industry reports estimated the total global market for tools and consumables used in drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research to have been approximately billion in and is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 
based on estimates contained in strategic studies performed in and updated in  the key segments on which we are currently focused represent a potential market of approximately billion in end user sales with an anticipated annual growth rate of approximately 

table of contents the table below briefly describes the key bioassay technologies in the life sciences industry key technologies description markets served biochips microarrays high density arrays of dna fragments or proteins attached to a flat glass or silicon surface biomedical research and select clinical diagnostics automated immunoassays automated test tube based instruments used for detecting antibodies  proteins and other analytes clinical diagnostics gels and blots physical separation of molecules or analytes for visualization clinical diagnostics and biomedical research real time pcr quantitative tests which monitor the progress of polymerase chain reaction pcr during the amplification reaction instead of post reaction nucleic acid testing in clinical diagnostics and biomedical research microfluidics chips miniaturized liquid handling system on a chip biomedical research microtiter plate based assays plastic trays with discrete wells in which different types of assays are fixed drug discovery  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research genotyping technologies dna primers or probes designed to identify small differences between dna targets using methods such as ligation assays  cleavage assays hybridization assays drug discovery  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research our xmap technology our xmap technology combines existing biological testing techniques with advanced digital signal processing and proprietary software 
with our technology  discrete bioassays are performed on the surface of color coded microspheres 
these microspheres are read in a compact analyzer that utilizes lasers and high speed digital signal processing to simultaneously identify the bioassay and measure the individual assay results 
the key features of xmap technology include the following multi analyte multi format xmap technology has been designed to simultaneously perform up to distinct bioassays in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample 
moreover  unlike most existing technologies that are dedicated to only one type of bioassay  xmap can perform multiple types of assays including enzymatic  genetic and immunologic tests on the same instrumentation platform 
flexibility scalability xmap technology allows flexibility in customizing test panels 
panels can be modified to include new bioassays in the same tube by adding additional microsphere sets 
it is also scalable  meaning that there is no change in the manufacturing process and only minimal changes to the required labor to produce a small or large number of microsphere based tests 
throughput our technology is currently able to perform up to tests in a single tube permitting up to  unattended tests to be detected in less than an hour with only a small amount of sample 
rapid sample analysis permits efficient use for high throughput applications 

table of contents ease of use most xmap bioassays are simple to perform 
a test sample is added to a solution containing microspheres that have been coated with reagents 
the solution is then processed through our xmap technology system which incorporates proprietary software to automate data acquisition and analysis in real time 
cost effective by performing multiple assays at one time  xmap technology is designed to be cost effective for customers compared to competitive techniques such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa or real time pcr 
by analyzing only those assays in which a customer is interested  xmap is also more cost effective than most competing microarray technologies 
in addition  microsphere based bioassays are inexpensive compared to other technologies such as biochips 
polystyrene microspheres  approximately microns in diameter  are a fundamental component of the xmap technology 
we purchase and manufacture microspheres and  in a proprietary process  dye them with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve up to distinct colors 
the specific dye proportions permit each color coded microsphere to be readily identified based on its distinctive fluorescent signature 
our customers create bioassays by attaching different biochemical reactants to each distinctly colored microsphere set 
the microsphere sets can then be combined in test panels as required by the user  with a current maximum of tests per panel 
customers can order either standard microspheres or magnetic microspheres 
to perform a bioassay using xmap technology  a researcher attaches biochemicals  or reagents  to one or more sets of color coded microspheres  which are then mixed with a test sample 
this mixture is injected into the xmap analyzer  where the microspheres pass single file in a fluid stream through two laser beams 
the first laser excites the internal dyes that are used to identify the color of the microsphere and the test being performed on the surface of the microsphere 
the second laser excites a fluorescent dye captured on the surface of the microspheres that is used to quantify the result of the bioassay taking place 
our proprietary optics  digital signal processors and software record the fluorescent signature of each microsphere and compare the results to the known identity of that color coded microsphere set 
the results are analyzed and displayed in real time with data stored on the computer database for reference  evaluation and analysis 
xtag technology developed by luminex molecular diagnostics lmd consists of several components including multiplexed pcr or target identification primers  dna tags  xmap microspheres  and data analysis software 
xtag technology permits the development of molecular diagnostic assays for clinical use by hospital and reference laboratories 
xtag technology has been applied  in particular  to human genetic assays  pharmacogenetic assays  and infectious disease assays 
business strategy our primary goal continues to be the establishment of luminex as an industry leader and xmap technology as the industry standard for performing bioassays by transforming luminex from a technology based company to a more market driven  customer focused company 
to achieve this goal  we have implemented and are pursuing the following strategies focus on key market segments the key market segments identified as a result of our strategic studies have been i profile oriented screening and secondary screening  ii rna profiling and transcriptional screening  iii genetic disease and molecular infectious disease testing  and iv immunodiagnostics

the fda classifies medical devices intended for human use into three classes 
for class i devices  general controls for example  labeling and good manufacturing practices provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness 
class ii devices are products for which general controls do not provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls for example  guidelines and patient registries 
class iii devices are products for which neither general nor special controls provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness 
generally  class iii includes devices that support or sustain human life  are for uses that are substantially important in preventing impairment of human health  are used as a stand alone assay for patient screening or diagnosis of disease  or present a potential  unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
we manufacture a version of the luminex and luminex the luminex integrated system is and the luminex integrated system is  respectively for use with diagnostic assay kits that are available through our strategic partners 
for fda purposes  the luminex is and luminex is are considered a component of our partners kit products 
depending on the particular kit s regulatory classification into class i  ii  or iii and its intended use  kits manufactured by our strategic partners that are used in conjunction with our technology may be subject to fda clearance or approval before they can be marketed and sold 
after incorporating the luminex is or luminex is into their products  our strategic partners are required to make various premarket submissions such as premarket approval applications  premarket notifications and or investigational device exemption applications to the fda for their products and are required to comply with numerous requirements and restrictions prior to clearance or approval of the applications 
there can be no assurance that the fda will file  clear or approve our strategic partners submissions 
we manufacture kit products that are intended for research use only applications as well as kits that are of the regulatory classification of class ii exempt in our austin  texas facility 
additionally  lmd manufactures kit products that are ivd cleared as well as intended for research use only and investigational use only applications 
in  we submitted a device master file dmf with information about the luminex is to the fda 
the dmf was updated in to include the luminex is 
our strategic partners can reference the dmf in their premarket submissions 
in  the fda reviewed our dmf while reviewing one of our strategic partner s submissions  and asked questions of the company about the content of the dmf 
it is possible that the fda may ask questions about our dmf each time one of our strategic partners submits an application to the fda referencing our dmf 
although we intend to respond to the fda s questions in a timely fashion  there can be no assurance that our responses will be acceptable to the fda 
updates to the dmf are provided to the fda as required 
in december  we submitted to the fda our request for k clearance on our lx is 
on december  the fda received our k k submission for the luminex is system 
once the instrument receives k clearance  all future diagnostic assay kits subject to fda clearance will reference the k for the instrument in their respective applications eliminating the need for the fda to review the device master file with each submission 

table of contents our instruments use lasers to identify the bioassays and measure their results 
therefore  we are required to ensure that our products comply with fda regulations pertaining to the performance of laser products 
these regulations are intended to ensure the safety of laser products by establishing standards to prevent exposure to excess levels of laser radiation 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations 
we  and our strategic partners  may be subject to periodic inspection by the fda for  among other things  compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations 
these regulations  also known as the quality system regulations  govern the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use 
additionally  our strategic partners may be subject to other premarket and post market controls such as labeling  complaint handling  medical device reporting  corrections and removals reporting  and record keeping requirements 
if the fda has evidence demonstrating that a company is not in compliance with applicable regulations  it can detain or seize products  request or  in certain circumstances  require a recall  impose operating restrictions  enjoin future violations  recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice  and assess civil and criminal penalties against the company  its officers  or its employees 
other regulatory agencies may have similar powers 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the united states 
these range from comprehensive preapproval requirements for medical products to simpler requests for product data or certification 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
there can be no assurance that we  and our strategic partners  will be able to obtain any approvals that may be required to market xmap technology products outside the united states 
lbg and lmd produce ce marked products which are subject to the eu directive 
ce marking is self declaration  not issued by a third party 
ce marking is based on mandatory european directives adopted and enforced in all member countries of the european union eu 
a product that is not ce marked is automatically considered to be non compliant 
the law is enforced through market surveillance by appointed national enforcement agencies 
imported products are checked for compliance at customs offices 
the state food and drug administration  pr china sfda is the government regulation authority in charge of safety management of drug  food  health food and cosmetics for the peoples republic of china

european ivd directive the eu s regulation of in vitro medical devices is under the in vitro diagnostic directive ivdd ec of october  as implemented in the eu member states 

table of contents the principle behind the directive is that no in vitro device or accessory may be placed on the market or put into service unless it satisfies the essential requirements set forth in the directive 
devices considered to meet the essential requirements must bear the ce marking of conformity when they are placed on the market 
the responsibility for placing the ce marking on the device lies with the manufacturer 
a manufacturer placing devices on the market in its name is required to notify its national competent authorities 
luminex corporation has declared that the lx is and the lx is are classified as a self declaration device and is in conformity with article  article  annex i essential requirements  and annex iii  and the additional provisions of ivdd ec 
however  there can be no assurance that the eu member states will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations 
as the european marketplace continues to be material to our operations  failure by the company or its strategic partners to comply with the directive could have a material adverse effect on our business 
environmental we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
in the course of our business  we are involved in the handling  storage and disposal of certain chemicals and biohazards 
the laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment 
some of these environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability  rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party 
such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination  including remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of  or conditions caused by  us or others  or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on  under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigation  remediation and monitoring requirements under federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities 
we do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted  we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future  or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
moreover  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact our strategic partners  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated component companies 
employees as of march   we had a total of employees and contract employees  as compared with as of december  at december  we had employees  including contract employees 
the increase from to is mainly due to the employees acquired effective march  upon the completion of the tm bioscience acquisition 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have not experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that relations with our employees are good
