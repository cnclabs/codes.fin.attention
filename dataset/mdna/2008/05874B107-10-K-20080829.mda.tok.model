bally gaming equipment and systems gaming equipment we design  manufacture  assemble  sell  maintain and operate a full range of technology based gaming devices and related equipment  parts and conversion kits 
these devices are normally configured to specific requirements based on a customer s particular order 
gaming devices are differentiated by a number of factors including  but not limited to  game theme  cabinet style  pay table  game layout  betting denomination and minimum maximum betting amount 
our gaming devices include a variety of innovative features and layouts in both video and mechanical reel formats 
our gaming devices come in several different cabinet styles with some devices featuring high profile top boxes with various game features and varying sizes geared towards specific market niches 
the gaming products we create are the result of comprehensive product development efforts that include extensive internal and third party testing 
we also perform market tests of our products with the cooperation of casino operators to assess reliability and player appeal 
we offer a number of different cabinet designs  from a standard upright to dramatic tower units to our new bar top cabinet 
our alpha elite cabinet series features interchangeable video and mechanical reel configurations and is recognized for its modularity  meaning that gaming operators can easily convert one game into another without having to invest in a whole new device 
in addition to easily changing the cabinet from one game to another  the modularity of our cabinets allows gaming operators to convert cabinets from video to mechanical reel games and easily replace top boxes  button decks  and other key parts  protecting gaming operators previously invested capital 
the modularity of our cabinets  combined with the use of common parts  also makes maintenance easier for our customers  providing labor saving benefits to gaming operators  while enabling a quicker manufacturing turn around

this technology allows the player to immediately stop all of the reels at once by tapping the spin button  thus enabling the player to establish their own rhythm of game play rather than have the game dictate the pace of play 
each gaming device contains an operating system referred to as a game platform 
the game platform manages the software needed to run the device 
game platforms and the related computer systems are constantly updated and revised to keep pace with the ever increasing complexity of modern game play requirements 
the change in game play requirements is driven by  among other things  changes in consumer demand  capacity  security and regulation 
in fiscal  we completed the successful migration from our legacy platforms  including the v and evo  to the linux based alpha os platform 
alpha os is now the platform for our video and mechanical reel gaming device product offerings and  as a result  marketing of our legacy products has generally been discontinued 
the alpha os platform is designed to separate the gaming operating system from the game layer  which enables game development in a much shorter time 
alpha os is also designed to incorporate bonusing  free spin  scatter and other advanced game features  while providing internal and third party developers with a secure  easy to use programming environment that incorporates an advanced set of development tools 
moreover  alpha os is designed to support networked and server based gaming initiatives  including download of game results and game content and configuration management 
additionally  our layered architecture and modular design allows for adaptability and simplified requirement changes 
alpha os is designed to support gaming standard association gsa standards and is compatible with most common accounting  ticketing and bonusing systems 
alpha os also supports various game bonusing  multi denomination  multi game and multi pay table game configurations and can operate with stand alone  local and wide area progressive products

certain equipment within gaming devices such as video monitors  bill validators  logic boards and printers are typically replaced  whether as a result of part failures or new technology offerings by our suppliers 
these sales may also include game conversion kits that provide our customers the opportunity to offer a new theme or variant on the existing product without the necessity of purchasing an entirely new gaming device 
we generally offer a day parts and labor warranty for new gaming devices 
we provide several after sale services to our customers including customer education programs  a hour customer service telephone hot line  a web site for technical support  field service support programs and spare parts programs

product development we believe providing gaming devices  content and systems with high entertainment value and key operational advantages coupled with a high level of customer service is important to gaining market share 
our global product development for new and emerging technologies  including many networked floor of the future solutions  is primarily led through the bally innovation lab 
this lab focuses on emerging and paradigm shifting technologies through research and development of new gaming technologies  features  and products and was designed to accelerate the commercial deployment of the most cutting edge gaming devices  content and systems technologies 
our product development process for our gaming devices and content includes both hardware and software 
major areas of hardware development include cabinet style  technical capability  interfaces  peripheral devices  and coin and currency handling 
hardware development efforts are focused on player appeal  product reliability and ease of maintenance 
development cycles for hardware can range from a few days for simple enhancements to more than a year for new electronics or new mechanical packages 
the software development process for new game content  which includes graphics development  is continuous and requires a significant commitment of human resources 
creativity in software development is an important element in the market success and player appeal of our gaming devices

we conduct one on one meetings with our customers to demonstrate our products at their locations  host customers to private demonstrations in our offices or at offsite venues  and participate in a number of trade shows domestically and internationally each year 
in certain cases  we participate in responding to competitive requests for proposals from private and public entities seeking to purchase gaming equipment 
for casino enterprise system sales  we offer our customers the option of signing separate hardware and software maintenance agreements at the time of sale

the sale of enterprise systems is often a long process  at times extending beyond one year 
typically  a potential systems customer will participate in a formal evaluation and selection of a system vendor 
the level of sales available to us at any point in time can vary materially due to a number of factors  including the capital budgets of our customers  availability of new product modules  timing associated with regulatory approvals  and the success and features contained in the products sold by our competitors 
the price paid for a full system can vary materially from customer to customer depending on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the size of the gaming operation and the number of functions contained in the system specified 
product markets we believe that the total installed base of gaming devices in the united states is between  and  units 
this total includes land based  riverboat  native american casinos and video lottery markets 
new sales opportunities for gaming devices in the united states and canada are primarily driven by replacement of existing units  new casino openings or expansions and the legalization of gaming in new markets

the market for our casino enterprise systems includes new casino openings  expansions and upgrades of existing facilities and the competitive replacement of other systems 
we also generate new system sales through the introduction of new hardware and software products 
in many cases  domestic regulations require the implementation of a system as part of their operational requirements while international markets have only recently begun the full implementation of such systems 
we believe  as international markets begin to mature and become more competitive  the use of systems will become more common 
competition and product demand the demand for gaming devices  content and systems varies depending on the level of new construction and renovation of casinos as well as market conditions that might generate the need for new and replacement equipment and product innovation

risk factors investing in our common stock involves risks 
prospective investors in our common stock should carefully consider  among other things  the following factors and other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and the notes to those statements  prior to making an investment decision 
we have identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements we may make from time to time 
our success in the gaming industry depends in large part on our ability to develop innovative products and systems 
if we fail to keep pace with rapid innovations in product design and deployment  or if we are unable to quickly adapt our development and manufacturing processes to release innovative products or systems  our business could be negatively impacted 
our success is heavily dependent on our ability to develop and sell new products and systems that are attractive not only to our customers  namely casino operators and other gaming enterprises  but also to their customers  the end players 
furthermore  if our gaming devices deployed in gaming operations do not meet or sustain revenue and profitability expectations they may be replaced by our competitor s devices 
therefore  our future success depends upon our ability to continue to design and market technologically sophisticated products that meet our customer s needs regarding  among other things  ease of use and adaptability  but also that are unique and entertaining such that they achieve high levels of player appeal and sustainability 
if our competitors continue to develop new game content and technologically innovative products and systems and we fail to keep pace  our business could be adversely affected 
the demands of our customers and the preferences of the end players are continuously changing 
as a result  there is constant pressure to develop and market new game content and technologically innovative products 
as our revenues are heavily dependent on the earning power and life span of our games and because newer game themes tend to have a shorter life span than more traditional game themes  we face increased pressure to design and deploy new and successful game themes to maintain our revenue stream and remain competitive 
while we feel we have been successful at developing new and innovative products  our ability to do so could be adversely affected by a decline in the popularity of our gaming products with players  a decision by our customers or the gaming industry in general to cut back on purchases of new gaming devices  content or systems in anticipation of newer technologies  an inability to roll out new games  services or systems on schedule as a result of delays in regulatory product approval in the applicable jurisdictions  or otherwise  and an increase in the popularity of competitors games 
our success also depends upon our ability to continuously implement manufacturing processes that generate cost efficiencies and to adapt our manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products 
because our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past  we must continually refine our production capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation 
if we cannot adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations  or if we are unable to make upgrades to our production capacity in a timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
the gaming industry is intensely competitive 
we face competition from a number of companies  some of whom have greater resources  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our business could be negatively impacted 
bally gaming and systems competition among gaming machine manufacturers is intense and is primarily based on the amount of profit our products generate for our customers in relation to our competitors products 
additionally  we compete on the basis of price and financing terms made available to customers  the appeal of game content and features to the end player  and the features and functionality of our hardware and software products 
there are a number of established  well financed companies producing gaming devices  game content and systems that compete with our products 
certain of these competitors may have access to greater capital resources than we do  and as a result  may be better positioned to compete in the marketplace 
the casino enterprise systems market is crowded  with igt and aristocrat comprising the primary competition 
the competition is intense due to the number of providers  as well as the limited number of casino operators and jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result of consolidation among the casino operators  the level of competition among providers has increased significantly as the number of potential customers has decreased 
pricing  accuracy  reliability  product feature and function are among the factors affecting a provider s success in selling its system 
casino operations among the principal competitive factors in the casino industry are the stature  age and location of the facility  the nature  variety and quality of the amenities and customer services offered  and the continuous development  implementation and success of a variety of marketing programs 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi  faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market and  to a lesser degree  indirect competition from those serving the gulf coast region 
a new casino project adjacent to the rainbow casino is under construction and is scheduled to open in november  and a nearby competitor property recently expanded its casino and added slot machines and the market s largest live poker room 
in addition  there may be other new casinos constructed in the vicksburg market in the future 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg 
as the overall size of the potential customer base for the vicksburg market is limited  we also face competition from casinos in nearby locations 
these properties may further dilute the market from which we and the other vicksburg casinos draw most of our patrons 
some of these sites may also be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  may enjoy a competitive advantage over our casino 
consumer spending on leisure activities is affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  as well as other factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
the demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers disposable incomes  and thus can be affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  both of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
unfavorable changes in general economic conditions including recession  economic slowdown  or higher fuel or other transportation costs  may reduce disposable income of casino patrons or result in fewer patrons visiting casinos 
as a result  we cannot ensure that demand for our products or services will remain constant 
continued adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world  including a general tightening of the availability of credit  increasing interest rates  increasing energy costs  acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters  declining consumer confidence or significant declines in the stock market could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on leisure activities adversely affecting our business 
to the extent there is a change in ownership of any of our customers or further consolidation within the casino industry  our business could be negatively impacted 
we are heavily dependent on the casino industry 
demand for our products is primarily driven by the replacement of existing products as well as the expansion of existing casinos and the opening of new properties and new jurisdictions 
casino operators in the gaming industry recently underwent a period of consolidation 
because a significant portion of our sales come from repeat customers  to the extent the industry further consolidates or one of our customers is sold to or merges with another entity that utilizes the products and services of one of our competitors or that reduces spending on our products or causes downward pricing pressures  our business could be negatively impacted 
business combinations of this nature could lead to a cancellation of orders  slow the replacement cycle or negatively impact pricing and purchasing decisions 
events within the industry leading or contributing to a decline in demand for our product  such as mergers or consolidations  could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to attract or retain the management or employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry 
the competition for qualified personnel in the gaming industry is intense 
our future success depends on the retention and continued contributions of our key management  finance  marketing  development and staff personnel  many of whom would be difficult or impossible to replace 
our success is also tied to our ability to recruit additional key personnel in the future 
we may not be able to retain our current personnel or recruit any additional key personnel required 
the loss of services of any of our personnel or our inability to recruit additional necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the gaming industry is heavily regulated and changes in regulation by gaming authorities may adversely impact our ability to operate in our existing markets or expand our business 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming devices  development of systems and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities 
our ability to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions or our ability to expand into new jurisdictions could be adversely affected by delays in adopting legislation to permit or expand gaming in new and existing jurisdictions  unfavorable public referendums  such as referendums to increase taxes on gaming revenues  unfavorable legislation affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators  adverse changes in or findings of non compliance with applicable governmental gaming regulations  delays in approvals from regulatory agencies  a limitation  conditioning  suspension or revocation of any of our gaming licenses  unfavorable determinations or challenges of suitability by gaming regulatory authorities with respect to our officers  directors  major stockholders or key personnel  and the adoption of new laws and regulations  or the repeal or amendment of existing laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  internet gaming 
public opinion can also exert a significant influence over the regulation of the gaming industry 
a negative shift in the public s perception of gaming  whether in individual jurisdictions or on a more general level  could affect future legislation 
among other things  such a shift could cause jurisdictions considering the legalization of gaming to abandon such a proposal  thereby limiting the number of new jurisdictions into which we could expand 
negative public perception could also lead to the implementation of new restrictions in jurisdictions in which we currently operate  thereby adversely affecting our operations 
although the laws  rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements  virtually all jurisdictions  including those into which we may expand in the future  require licenses  permits  qualification documentation  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval to engage in gaming operations or the manufacture and distribution of gaming devices 
our officers  directors  major stockholders and key personnel are also subject to significant regulatory scrutiny 
in the event that gaming or governmental authorities determine that any person is unsuitable to act in such capacity with respect to bally  we could be required to terminate our relationship with such person 
to our knowledge  we and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary to conduct our activities in the various jurisdictions that we operate 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits or approvals will be renewed in the future  or that new forms of approval necessary to operate in emerging or existing markets will be granted 
our intellectual property protections may be insufficient to properly safeguard our technology 
the gaming industry is constantly employing new technologies in both new and existing markets 
we rely on a combination of patent and other technical security measures to protect our products  and continue to apply for patents protecting such technologies 
notwithstanding these safeguards  our competitors may still be able to obtain our technology or imitate our products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products similar or superior to ours 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or invalidity 
expenses incurred with respect to monitoring  protecting and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
competitors and other third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights  or may allege that we have infringed on their rights 
monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive  and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights 
we may also incur significant litigation expenses protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of intellectual property  reducing our ability to fund product initiatives 
these expenses could have an adverse effect on our future cash flows and results of operations 
we are currently subject to litigation regarding patent infringement which  if resolved adversely to us  could have a material impact on our business 
if we are found to infringe on the rights of others we could be required to discontinue offering certain products or systems  to pay damages  or purchase a license to use the intellectual property in question from its owner 
litigation can also distract management from the day to day operations of the business 
there can be no assurances that certain of our products  including those with currently pending patent applications  will not be determined to have infringed upon an existing third party patent 
the intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products or entering new markets 
the gaming industry is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies  which requires us to continuously introduce new products using these technologies and innovations  as well as to expand into new markets that may be created 
therefore  our success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies 
however  to the extent technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of others  including our competitors  we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies 
if the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies  our financial condition  operating results or prospects may be harmed 
our gaming operations  particularly our wide area progressive networks and centrally determined systems  may experience losses due to technical difficulties or fraudulent activities 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware errors and fraudulent manipulation of our products and systems 
to the extent any of our gaming devices or software experience errors or fraudulent manipulation  our customers may replace our products and services with those of our competitors 
in addition  the occurrence of errors in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming devices or software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities  including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses or disciplinary action 
additionally  in the event of such issues with our gaming devices or software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other areas to rectify the problem 
we have a material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  which could adversely affect our ability to manage and to report our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows accurately 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  management conducts assessments of our internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could  among other things  adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
in performing our most current assessment  management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june  for a detailed description of the material weakness  see item a  controls and procedures 
we have taken and will continue to take certain measures to strengthen our internal controls  as set forth under item a  controls and procedures 
however  additional work still remains to address the identified material weakness 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal controls as our business evolves  we may not be able to  among other things  accurately report our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
any such failure could lead to  among other things  an additional sec enforcement action  additional securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which could adversely affect our business and prospects 
the ongoing sec investigation could adversely affect us 
the sec is conducting a formal inquiry into certain matters surrounding allegations relating to the former securities class action litigation and our methods of revenue recognition 
in accordance with its normal practice  the sec has not advised us when its investigation may be concluded  and we are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation 
while we are cooperating fully with the investigation  adverse developments in connection with the investigation  including any expansion of the scope of the investigation  could negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations 
in connection with any sec investigation  it is possible that we will be required to  among other things  pay fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct  further restate our financial statements or suffer other penalties  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
unfavorable political developments  weak foreign economies and other foreign risks may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on international markets for a portion of our revenues 
as of june   bally gaming and systems had million of receivables  or of our total receivables  from customers in foreign countries 
we expect that receivables with respect to foreign sales will continue to account for a portion of our total revenues 
as a result  our business in these markets is subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies  expropriation  nationalization and limitation on repatriation of earnings  currency exchange fluctuations  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  social  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  ability to finance foreign operations  changes in consumer tastes and trends  tariffs and other trade barriers  acts of war or terrorism  and us government requirements for export 
there can be no assurances that any of these international developments  or others  would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our bank loan agreement imposes significant restrictions 
failure to comply with these restrictions could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our debt  which we may not be able to repay or refinance 
we do not expect to remain in compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio beginning in september and we may not be able to obtain new financing on equal or better terms or obtain a waiver to cure the default 
our bank loan agreement contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries  and engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates 
in addition  our bank loan agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios  including a fixed charge coverage ratio and certain leverage ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios  meet our debt service obligations or reduce our total debt is dependent upon our future performance  which may be affected by events beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with such restrictions and limitations  or that they will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  or engage in other business activities that would otherwise be in our interest 
the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio as of the date of the end of each fiscal quarter includes as a component of the calculation of fixed charges for such period all payments of principal scheduled to be made during the subsequent twelve month period 
because the term portion of our bank loan matures as of september  the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio for the period ending september  will include the entire unpaid principal amount of our term loan as a component of the calculation of fixed charges 
as a result  beginning on september   we do not expect to remain in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio 
we have initiated discussions with lenders seeking to refinance the term loan and obtain a new revolving credit facility 
we have also initiated discussions with our existing lenders regarding obtaining a waiver that would cure the default 
while we do not anticipate significant difficulties in obtaining new financing or a waiver  because of the current conditions of the credit markets there can be no assurances that we will obtain such financing or a waiver  or that any new financing will be on equal or better terms than those of our current bank loan agreement 
any new financing may be subject to higher interest rates  may include less favorable financial ratios or may require us to agree to additional or more severe restrictions on our business activities as compared to those of our current bank loan agreement 
a breach of any of our covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios under the bank loan agreement or under any replacement loan agreement could result in a default under such loan agreement 
in the event of any such default  the lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under such loan agreement  together with any accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  as well as require us to apply all available cash to repay the amounts 
if we were unable to repay the indebtedness upon its acceleration  the lenders could proceed against the underlying collateral 
there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay the amount in full  that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the indebtedness or that we would be able to obtain a waiver to cure the default 
virtually all of our debt is subject to variable interest rates  and therefore rising interest rates could negatively impact our business 
borrowings under our bank loan agreement bear interest at a variable rate 
in addition  we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future 
carrying indebtedness subject to variable interest rates makes us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reduces our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
increases in interest rates on this indebtedness would increase our interest expense  which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to service our debt as well as our ability to grow the business 
current borrowings  as well as potential future financings  may substantially increase our current indebtedness 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate the cash flows necessary to permit us to meet our fixed charges and payment obligations with respect to our debt 
we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to meet these fixed charges and payment obligations 
should we incur additional debt  among other things  such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to expand our business  market our products and make investments and capital expenditures  adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions and other sources  and create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels 
any inability to service our fixed charges and payment obligations  or the incurrence of additional debt  would have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and business generally 
an inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could negatively affect expected levels of operations and new product development 
future revenue may not be sufficient to meet operating  product development and other cash flow requirements 
sufficient funds to service our debt and maintain new product development efforts and expected levels of operations may not be available  and additional capital  if and when needed by us  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to carry out our planned product development efforts and level of operations  which could harm our business 
our financial results vary from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact our business 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results  some of which are not within our control 
these factors include  among others the financial strength of the gaming industry  consumers willingness to spend money on leisure activities  the timing and introduction of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  product and service pricing and discounts  the timing of acquisitions of other companies and businesses or dispositions  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are likely to cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
based on the foregoing  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
in addition  such fluctuations could cause us to be unable to comply with the financial ratios in our bank loan agreement 
the provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and nevada law could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock 
our restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to issue special shares from time to time  with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate 
our board of directors could authorize the issuance of special shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 
as a nevada corporation  we are also subject to certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law that have anti takeover effects and may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with  and to obtain the approval of  our board of directors in connection with such a transaction 
however  certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of bally  including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so
