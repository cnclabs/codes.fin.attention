item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components to nearly all domestic and foreign based manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  changes in supply chain alignment by a customer  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
from time to time we have researched the benefits and feasibility of manufacturing our disk drive products in asia 
we have selected thailand as the location for establishing an asian assembly operation 
in light of current uncertain market and economic conditions  we are assessing the pace of our investment in this operation 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in the development  production and commercialization of products for the medical device market 
net sales from the inspectra sto system during  our first full year in the market  exceeded  although we incurred an operating loss in for our biomeasurement division 
the number of customers for the inspectra sto system totaled as of september   up from at the end of the preceding fiscal year 
additionally  more than hospitals in the united states and europe are currently evaluating the system or moving toward purchase 
in our biomeasurement division  we expect to reach  to  of net sales in for calendar  storage industry analysts expect disk drive shipments to reach million units  an increase of about from calendar the growth in disk drive shipments is resulting from increased demand for data storage in traditional computing applications  as well as in consumer electronics applications 
our shipments of suspension assemblies in were million  lower than our shipments in this decrease was primarily due to our share loss for our suspension assemblies used in inch ata disk drives  a customer s accelerated purchases late in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in lower demand from that customer in the first quarter of  and our fiscal year calendar having weeks 
in the long term  we believe that end user demand for storage capacity will continue to increase as evolving consumer electronics and computing applications continue to require storage devices with increased capacity and functionality  which will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand 
for  however  our suspension assembly demand forecast reflects a decline in worldwide suspension volume 
this is based in part on assumptions regarding demand for hard disk drives and the focus of drive manufacturers on moving to higher areal density points and improving yields 
based on these lower suspension demand projections and continued downward pressure on our average selling price  we expect our net sales to decline in  which will contribute to an expected net loss for subsequent to our year end  demand for suspension assemblies for has weakened significantly 
we expect our first quarter of suspension assembly shipments to decline more than from the fourth quarter of in response to the weakening demand and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  we are taking actions to reduce our expected loss in we announced on december   a reduction of our workforce 
in addition  we will be implementing a pay reduction for all employees not affected by the workforce reduction 
we expect our financial results for the first quarter ending december   will include a charge of  to  related to severance costs 
the workforce and pay reductions are expected to be complete by the end of january and are part of our strategy to manage our cash and balance sheet and reduce our overall cost structure by approximately  to  on an annualized basis 
we also announced our plan to reduce our capital spending from  to  we are assessing the impact of these actions on the recoverability of our manufacturing assets and may need to record an asset impairment charge in the future 
the following table sets forth our recent quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities the decrease in suspension assembly shipments in the second and third quarters of was primarily due to seasonally slower demand and share loss for our suspension assemblies used in desktop more specifically  inch ata disk drives 
the inch ata segment share loss was partially offset as we continued to improve our position in the faster growing  but smaller  mobile segment of the disk drive market 
our fourth quarter shipments increased due to seasonally stronger demand for disk drives  including a customer s accelerated purchases at the end of the quarter to realize volume price breaks  as well as our fiscal quarter having fourteen weeks in and our continued market share gains in the mobile segment of the disk drive market 
the sequential decrease in the first quarter of reflects the impact of the accelerated customer purchases late in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in lower demand from that customer in the first quarter  and our first quarter of having thirteen weeks 
without these factors  our total suspension assembly shipments in the first quarter of would have increased modestly as compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease in the second quarter of was primarily the result of our customers lower build plans during the seasonally slower quarter  our market share losses in the inch ata segment and share shifts among our customers in the inch mobile segment 
our third quarter shipments increased primarily due to gains in the inch mobile segment and we maintained our market leading position in the enterprise segment 
our fourth quarter shipments increased due to seasonally stronger demand for disk drives 
this sequential quarter volume growth reflects holding our overall market share about flat with the preceding quarter 
we expect our shipments of suspension assemblies to decline more than sequentially in the first quarter of  but we continue to have limited visibility for future demand 
our selling prices are subject to market pressure from our competitors and pricing pressure from our customers 
disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing remains competitive 
our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product s life cycle 
a typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when products are introduced and decreasing prices as they mature 
to offset price decreases during a product s life  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yields and efficiencies to reduce our cost 
if we cannot increase our sales volume or reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products life cycles  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
for  our average selling price declined to or from our average selling price for primarily due to a sales mix that included a higher percentage of suspension assemblies for mature disk drive programs 
customers extended the lives of certain mature disk drive programs  and we competed aggressively on these programs 
the average selling price is typically lower on suspension assemblies for mature disk drive programs as higher cumulative volumes trigger lower price points and the competitive pressure increases as our competitors abilities to manufacture these products improves 
for  our average selling price decreased from in the first half of to in the fourth quarter of due to competitive pressures 
we expect continued downward pressure in on our average selling price 
we typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vendor managed inventory  or vmi  facilities 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
our gross profits have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors such as changes in demand or customer requirements  utilization of existing or newly added production capacity  manufacturing yields or efficiencies  product and feature mix  selling prices  production and engineering costs associated with production of new products and features  and costs of materials  including gold 
gross profit in was  down from in  primarily due to the substantial decline in net sales  which reduced our ability to cover our fixed costs 
in addition  we incurred rising costs related to our tsa processes 
for  these tsa costs reduced gross profit by  we shipped million tsa suspension assemblies during the fourth quarter of  a four fold increase from the preceding quarter as the ramp in tsa volume production continued 
although the initiation of tsa volume production has dampened our gross profit  we expect this burden to diminish with the tsa volume growth and as we achieve further improvements in process efficiencies that are expected over the next year 
in response to weakening demand and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  we are taking actions to reduce our expected loss in we announced on december   a reduction of our workforce  which totaled approximately  employees at the end of november in addition  we will be implementing a pay reduction for all employees not affected by the workforce reduction 
the workforce and pay reductions are expected to be complete by the end of january and are part of our strategy to manage our cash and balance sheet and reduce our overall cost structure 
during the third quarter of  we took actions to reduce operating costs  including eliminating approximately positions company wide 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of  the workforce reduction and other cost reduction actions are expected to reduce expenses by  to  on an annualized basis 
we believe these cost reductions will contribute to improving our financial performance without jeopardizing our longer term opportunities 
however  our return to profitability will ultimately be driven by revenue growth and by leveraging our investments in our tsa processes and our biomeasurement division 
during the third quarter of  we eliminated approximately positions in our workforce  including manufacturing and manufacturing support  administrative and development positions at all plant sites 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of  we also recorded a charge of  for the write off of design costs for a cancelled facility expansion in the united states in the third quarter of we estimate that these and other cost reduction actions resulted in annualized savings of approximately the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and our customers operating results are dependent on being the first to market and first to volume with new products at a low cost 
our development efforts typically enable us to shorten development cycles and achieve high volume output per manufacturing unit more quickly than our competitors  and are an important factor in our success 
the development of next generation read write technology and the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs are leading to suspension assemblies that will require finer electrical conductors 
our current tsa suspensions are produced using a subtractive process  and we continue to extend our current process capabilities for manufacturing tsa suspension assemblies to meet escalating customer requirements for precision and performance 
we have also developed an additive process and added associated capital equipment for producing tsa suspension assemblies 
additive processing involves depositing thin metal layers onto a polyimide surface in the shape of the desired circuitry and then imaging and plating up metal layers to form the suspension s electrical conductors 
our tsa suspensions are the plan of record on multiple customer programs and our customers have expressed a high level of interest 
we have completed installation of and initiated production on a volume tsa flexure production line  and we are making good progress at improving our processes 
we expect the full transition to tsa suspensions to take place over the next five to seven years  with the pace of transition determined primarily by the pace at which disk drive makers introduce and ramp production of programs requiring additive processing 
we will also purchase additive flexures to meet customer requirements 
we spent  on research and development in compared to  in in  we continued development of the additive processes required for our tsa suspension assemblies and development of new process technologies for next generation suspension assembly products and equipment 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to  of lower expenses primarily related to the classification of the costs of running the tsa manufacturing lines as cost of sales beginning in the fourth quarter of research and development spending specific to our biomeasurement division was  in and  in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of  related to establishing a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under that standard  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that  based on sfas no 
guidelines  a full valuation allowance should now be established 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
for  our capital expenditures were  primarily for tsa suspension production capacity  new program tooling and deployment of new process technology and capability improvements 
for  our capital expenditures were  primarily for tsa suspension production capacity  new program tooling and deployment of new process technology and capability improvements 
the decrease from to was primarily due to completion of our volume tsa suspension production line in we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately  in  primarily for tooling and manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements 
as the full transition to tsa suspensions takes place over the next five to seven years  our capital expenditures could increase as we add capacity as needed 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products  market demand for disk drives  process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions 
capital spending is also based on our ability to fund capital expenditures  as needed  with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  our credit facility or additional financing  if available given current capital market conditions 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
new manufacturing processes for advanced suspension assembly features and suspension assembly types  such as those currently under development  including our tsa manufacturing processes  initially have lower manufacturing yields than those for more mature products and processes 
manufacturing yields generally improve as the process and product mature and production volumes increase 
manufacturing yields also vary depending on the complexity and uniqueness of products 
small variations in manufacturing yields can have a significant impact on gross profits 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvements to our gross profits and operating profits will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our profits are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
as part of our efforts to improve our operating results  we eliminated approximately positions during our third quarter of and we eliminated approximately positions along with other cost reduction actions during our third quarter of on december   we announced a reduction of our workforce 
in the future  we may need to adjust our overall employment level due to fluctuating demand 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of market trends our suspension assemblies are components in computers and a variety of consumer electronics products 
the demand for these products can be volatile 
in a weak economy as we are currently experiencing  consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics tends to decrease  as does business demand for computer systems 
demand for suspension assemblies therefore may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in the long term  however  we expect that the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software and the growth of new applications for disk storage  such as digital video recorders and personal storage devices  together with emerging opportunities in other consumer electronics applications  will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices that disk drives are used in 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is competitive 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per gigabyte of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with finer electrical conductors and further adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as clad unamount arms  plated grounds  electrostatic protection measures  formed and polished headlifts  a variety of limiter configurations  dampers  laminated loadbeams and dual stage actuation 
the development of next generation read write technology and head sizes  continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
we are investing significantly in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the introduction of new types or sizes of read write heads and disk drives may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
for example  we believe reduced yields for some of our customers due to their transition to higher density read write heads resulted in increased shipments of our suspension assemblies in and the first half of as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
the advent of new disk drive technologies and the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs are leading to suspension assemblies that will require finer electrical conductors and further adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies 
while we are generally able to increase our selling price for these suspension assemblies  these changes may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
these changes will continue to affect us

gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit as a percent of net sales was in compared to in the lower gross profit in was primarily due to a  increase in manufacturing overhead expense compared to  coupled with underutilization of manufacturing equipment 
the negative impact of the underutilization was somewhat offset by improvements in labor productivity and yields

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity  if available given current credit market conditions 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at september   to  at september  our short and long term investments decreased from  to  during the same period 
in total  our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments decreased by  we spent  for repurchases of our common stock and  for capital expenditures 
we also recognized a charge of  for the other than temporary impairment of our ars holdings 
these decreases were partially offset by  of cash generated from operations and  in net proceeds from issuances of our common stock for stock options exercised and from our employee stock purchase plan during as of september   the value of our ars portfolio was reduced from its par value of  to an estimated fair value of  our ars portfolio consists primarily of aaa aaa rated securities that are collateralized by student loans that are primarily guaranteed by the united states government under the federal family education loan program 
none of our ars portfolio consists of mortgage backed obligations 
prior to february  the ars market historically was highly liquid and our ars portfolio typically traded at auctions held every or days 
starting in february  most of the ars auctions in the marketplace have failed  including auctions for all of the ars we hold  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
the immediate effect of a failed auction is that the interest rate on the security generally resets to a contractual rate and holders cannot liquidate their holdings 
the contractual rate at the time of a failed auction for the majority of the ars we hold is based on a trailing twelve month ninety one day united states treasury bill rate plus or a one month libor rate plus 
other contractual factors can result in rate restrictions based on the profitability of the issuer or can impose temporary rates that are significantly higher or lower 
we continue to earn and receive interest at these contractual rates on our ars portfolio 
our ars portfolio will continue to be offered for auction until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the security  the security matures after a term of up to years or  in light of recent uncertainties in the global credit and financial markets  we may decide not to hold until final maturity if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms 
there is no assurance that future auctions of securities in our ars portfolio will be successful 
as a result  our ability to voluntarily liquidate and recover the carrying value of some or our entire ars portfolio may be limited for an indefinite period of time up to a maximum of each security s final maturity date 
this limitation could negatively affect our overall liquidity 
our entire ars portfolio is classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we believe that long term classification is appropriate due to the uncertainty of when we will be able to sell these securities 
as of the date of this report  there was insufficient observable ars market information available to directly determine the fair value of our investments 
using the limited available market valuation information  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of the investments and recorded an other than temporary realized loss of  as of september  the valuation model we used to estimate the fair market value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of credit quality  contractual rate  expected cash flows  discount rates  expected term and overall ars market liquidity 
our valuation is sensitive to market conditions and management judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used 
if we are unable to sell our ars at auction or our assumptions differ from actual results  we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments 
we are assessing the impact that the current illiquidity of these ars will have on our ability to execute our current business plan 
our current business plan  however  is subject to change depending on  among other things  deterioration in our business  further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions  and our ability to execute our current business plan may in the future be impacted by the continued illiquidity of our ars investments 
in january  we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of january   between us and lasalle bank national association  as trustee the indenture 
interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year  which began on july  we have the right to redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes on or after january  at specified redemption prices  as provided in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the applicable redemption date 
holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on january   january   and january   or in the event of a fundamental change  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the purchase date 
under certain circumstances  holders of the notes may convert their notes based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion  in lieu of shares of our common stock  for each  principal amount of notes a holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of i  or ii the conversion value  determined in the manner set forth in the indenture  of the number of shares of our common stock equal to the conversion rate 
if the conversion value exceeds  we also will deliver  at our election  cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock with respect to the remaining common stock deliverable upon conversion 
if a holder elects to convert such holder s notes in connection with a fundamental change that occurs prior to january   we will pay  to the extent described in the indenture  a make whole premium by increasing the conversion rate applicable to such notes 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually  which began on september  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at any time prior to their stated maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share 
beginning march   the notes became redeemable  in whole or in part  at our option at of their principal amount  and thereafter at prices declining to on march  in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  together with accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  for the period to  but excluding  the date of the repurchase 
during november  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we repurchased a portion of the outstanding notes 
we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
the repurchases leave  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of approximately  will be reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of we may from time to time seek to prepay or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these transactions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
on november   we and hta amended our second amended and restated loan agreement the amendment relating to our credit facility with bofa the credit facility 
the amendment reduces the credit commitment from  to  within days of entering into the amendment  adjusts the credit facility s maturity date to december   provides for a blanket lien on substantially all of our and hta s non real estate assets  increases the maximum allowable debt to total capital ratio to to  increases the credit facility s pricing to libor plus or prime plus and increases to the fee to be paid on the unused amount of the credit facility 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease from to was primarily due to completion of our volume tsa suspension production line in we currently anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  in  primarily for tooling and manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements 
as the full transition to tsa suspensions takes place over the next five to seven years  our capital expenditures will increase as we add capacity as needed 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments  our credit facility or additional financing  if available given current credit market conditions 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products  market demand for disk drives  process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions 
capital spending is also based on our ability to fund capital expenditures  as needed  with cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  the credit facility or additional financing  if available given current capital market conditions 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
the financial covenants to which we were subject as of september   are contained in the credit facility loan agreement  as amended 
the covenants include shareholder distribution limitations  debt related ratios and cash and earnings coverage tests 
we had no outstanding loans under the credit facility at any time during or as of september   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility loan agreement  as amended 
given our current cash position  cash generated from operations and future business plans  we believe it is likely that we will be able to comply with these covenants 
a deterioration in our business  however  or further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions could impact our ability to comply with these covenants 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to spend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of september   we have spent  to repurchase million shares at an average price of 
the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase plan is  all of our repurchases during were made on the open market 
during  we entered into contracts to hedge gold commodity price risks through july the contracts essentially established a fixed price for the underlying commodity and were designated and qualified at inception as effective cash flow hedges of purchases of gold 
it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions only to the extent true exposures exist 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
we evaluate hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis 
derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
when a derivative is determined to be or is no longer expected to be highly effective  hedge accounting is discontinued 
hedge ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in our cost of sales 
the fair value of these contracts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of september   was  included in other current assets and  included in accrued expenses 
the effective portion is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax with a full valuation allowance recorded against it 
the gains losses on these contracts are recorded in cost of sales as the commodities are consumed 
ineffectiveness is calculated as the amount by which the change in fair value of the derivatives exceeds the change in fair value of the anticipated commodity purchases and is recorded in cost of sales 
in light of current uncertain market and economic conditions  we are aggressively managing our cost structure and cash position to ensure that we will meet our debt obligations while preserving the ability to make investments that will enable us to respond to customer requirements and achieve long term profitable growth 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations  our credit facility and additional financing  if needed and as available given current credit market conditions  will be sufficient to meet our forecasted operating expenses  debt service requirements  debt and equity repurchases and capital expenditures through our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all  if needed 
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt interest expense operating leases litigation charge derivative contracts total as of september   the fin liability balance for uncertain tax positions was  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
during november  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we repurchased a portion of the outstanding notes 
we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
the repurchases leave  par value of the notes outstanding 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of approximately  will be reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of we may from time to time seek to prepay or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these transactions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements on november   we and hta entered into the amendment relating to our credit facility with bofa 
the amendment reduces the credit commitment from  to  within days of entering into the amendment  adjusts the credit facility s maturity date to december   provides for a blanket lien on substantially all of our and hta s non real estate assets  increases the maximum allowable debt to total capital ratio to to  increases the credit facility s pricing to libor plus or prime plus and increases to the fee to be paid on the unused amount of the credit facility 
letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility will not be included on our balance sheet unless and until the beneficiary of the letter of credit draws upon it 
letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility to support self insured workers compensation arrangements totaled  as of september   resulting in  of remaining availability at that date 
we currently do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  as amended and codified by staff accounting bulletin no 
 update of codification of staff accounting bulletins codification of staff accounting bulletins  topic revenue recognition  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revision of topic codification of staff accounting bulletins  topic revenue recognition  section a selected revenue recognition issues 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store disk drive components division inventory in vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for engineering services and specific program capacity to partially offset the costs of our investment 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program to which the services and capacity relate 
investments we account for securities available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which requires that available for sale securities be carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income within shareholders investment  net of applicable income taxes 
realized gains and losses and decline in value deemed to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income 
fair value of the securities is based on quoted market prices in active markets or estimated fair value when quoted market prices are not available 
the cost basis for realized gains and losses on available for sale securities is determined on a specific identification basis 
we classify our securities available for sale as short or long term based on management s intent and ability to hold these investments 
our entire ars portfolio is classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we believe that long term classification is appropriate due to the uncertainty of when we will be able to sell these securities 
as of the date of this report  there was insufficient observable ars market information available to directly determine the fair value of our investments 
using the limited available market valuation information  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of the investments and recorded an other than temporary realized loss of  as of september  accounts receivable we are dependent on a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable is highly concentrated 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectability based on past transaction history with the customer and the customer s financial condition 
while we perform ongoing credit reviews of our customers and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any significant customer may result in additional charges to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or to write off certain accounts 
we record a provision against revenue for estimated returns on sales of our products in the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
we base the allowance on historical returns  as well as existing product return authorizations 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
at september   and september   we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under that standard  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded based on sfas no 
guidelines that a full valuation allowance should now be established 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters we are involved in certain legal matters which may result in additional future cash requirements 
we are unable to estimate the future cash requirements if any 
see the discussion of these matters in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab permits us to adjust for the cumulative effect of misstatements related to prior years  previously deemed to be immaterial  in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current fiscal year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
sab also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements in future sec filings within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such misstatements on the quarters when the information is next presented 
this adjustment does not require reports previously filed with the sec to be amended 
effective september   we elected early application of sab in accordance with sab  we reduced our opening retained earnings for by  net of tax of  and adjusted our financial results for the first three quarters of we consider this adjustment to be immaterial to prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for a discussion of other recent accounting pronouncements 
the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law on october  the ajca contains two provisions that affect us 
the first provision is the repeal of the eie provisions  which were phased out on a calendar year basis with the benefit ending december  the second provision of the ajca that affects us is the introduction of a deduction for a percentage of income from domestic production activities 
the deduction is limited in any fiscal year in which a taxpayer uses nol carryforwards 
for and  we did not realize any benefit from this deduction as we have unused nol carryforwards 
the deduction is phased in on a calendar year basis and will be fully phased in for our fiscal year ending september  inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the credit facility carries interest rate risk  in connection with certain borrowings for which it provides  that is generally related to either libor or the prime rate 
if either of these rates were to change while we had such borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  interest expense would increase or decrease accordingly 
at september   there were no outstanding loans under the credit facility 
we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our other debt obligations which are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  with a fair market value of approximately  our investing activities are guided by an investment policy  which is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors  and whose objectives are preservation and safety of capital  maintenance of necessary liquidity and maximizing of the rate of return within the stated guidelines 
our policy provides guidelines as to the maturity  concentration limits and credit quality of our investments  as well as guidelines for communication  authorized securities and other policies and procedures in connection with our investing activities 
we are exposed to various market risks and potential loss arising from changes in interest rates in connection with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in investment accounts 
as of september   the value of our ars portfolio was reduced from its par value of  to an estimated fair value of  our ars portfolio consists primarily of aaa aaa rated securities that are collateralized by student loans that are primarily guaranteed by the united states government under the federal family education loan program 
none of our ars portfolio consists of mortgage backed obligations 
prior to february  the ars market historically was highly liquid and our ars portfolio typically traded at auctions held every or days 
starting in february  most of the ars auctions in the marketplace have failed  including auctions for all of the ars we hold  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
the immediate effect of a failed auction is that the interest rate on the security generally resets to a contractual rate and holders cannot liquidate their holdings 
the contractual rate at the time of a failed auction for the majority of the ars we hold is based on a trailing twelve month ninety one day united states treasury bill rate plus or a one month libor rate plus 
other contractual factors can result in rate restrictions based on the profitability of the issuer or can impose temporary rates that are significantly higher or lower 
we continue to earn and receive interest at these contractual rates on our ars portfolio 
our ars portfolio will continue to be offered for auction until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the security  the security matures after a term of up to years or  in light of recent uncertainties in the global credit and financial markets  we may decide not to hold until final maturity if the opportunity arises to sell these securities on reasonable terms 
our entire ars portfolio is classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we believe that long term classification is appropriate due to the uncertainty of when we will be able to sell these securities 
as of the date of this report  there was insufficient observable ars market information available to directly determine the fair value of our investments 
using the limited available market valuation information  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of the investments and recorded an other than temporary realized loss of  as of september  the valuation model we used to estimate the fair market value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of credit quality  contractual rate  expected cash flows  discount rates  expected term and overall ars market liquidity 
our valuation is sensitive to market conditions and management judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used 
if we are unable to sell our ars at auction or our assumptions differ from actual results  we may be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments 
we are assessing the impact that the current illiquidity of these ars will have on our ability to execute our current business plan 
our current business plan  however  is subject to change depending on  among other things  deterioration in our business  further disruption in the global credit and financial markets and related continuing adverse economic conditions  and our ability to execute our current business plan may in the future be impacted by the continued illiquidity of our ars investments 
all of our sales transactions in our disk drive components division are denominated in united states dollars and thus are not subject to risk due to currency exchange fluctuations 
certain sales transactions in our biomeasurement division are denominated in foreign currencies 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments for which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and by limiting the amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause under which each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of september   the fair market value of all derivative contracts on our consolidated balance sheet was a net liability of
