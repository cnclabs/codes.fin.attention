item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein 

table of contents our cash flow consists almost exclusively of distributions from crosstex energy  lp our only cash generating assets are our partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of the partnership to make distributions to its partners 
the amount of cash that the partnership can distribute to its partners  including us  each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering and transmission pipelines  the level of the partnership s processing and treating operations  the fees the partnership charges and the margins it realizes for its services  the price of natural gas  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  and its level of operating costs 
in addition  the actual amount of cash the partnership will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond its control  including the level of capital expenditures the partnership makes  the cost of acquisitions  if any  its debt service requirements  fluctuations in its working capital needs  restrictions on distributions contained in its bank credit facility  its ability to make working capital borrowings under its bank credit facility to pay distributions  prevailing economic conditions  and the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its sole discretion for the proper conduct of its business 
we are largely prohibited from engaging in activities that compete with the partnership 
so long as we own the general partner of the partnership  we are prohibited by an omnibus agreement with the partnership from engaging in the business of gathering  transmitting  treating  processing  storing and marketing natural gas and transporting  fractionating  storing and marketing ngls  except to the extent that the partnership  with the concurrence of its independent directors comprising its conflicts committee  elects not to engage in a particular acquisition or expansion opportunity 
this exception for competitive activities is relatively limited 
although we have no current intention of pursuing the types of opportunities that we are permitted to pursue under the omnibus agreement such as competitive opportunities that the partnership declines to pursue or permitted activities that are not competition with the partnership  the provisions of the omnibus agreement may  in the future  limit activities that we would otherwise pursue 
in our corporate charter  we have renounced business opportunities that may be pursued by the partnership or by affiliated stockholders that hold a majority of our common stock 
in our restated charter and in accordance with delaware law  we have renounced any interest or expectancy we may have in  or being offered an opportunity to participate in  any business opportunities  including any opportunities within those classes of opportunity currently pursued by the partnership  presented to persons who are officers or directors of the company or who  on october   were  and at the time of presentation are  stockholders of the company or to persons who are affiliates or associates of such officers  directors or stockholders  if the company is prohibited from participating in such opportunities by the omnibus agreement  or 
table of contents any investment fund sponsored or managed by yorktown partners llc  including any fund still to be formed  or to any of our directors who is an affiliate or designate of these entities 
as a result of this renunciation  these officers  directors and stockholders should not be deemed to be breaching any fiduciary duty to us if they or their affiliates or associates pursue opportunities presented as described above 
although we control the partnership  the general partner owes fiduciary duties to the partnership and the unitholders 
conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationship between us and our affiliates  including the general partner  on the one hand  and the partnership and its limited partners  on the other hand 
the directors and officers of crosstex energy gp  llc have fiduciary duties to manage the general partner in a manner beneficial to us  its owner 
at the same time  the general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage the partnership in a manner beneficial to the partnership and its limited partners 
the board of directors of crosstex energy gp  llc will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict 
the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our stockholders 
for example  conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations the allocation of shared overhead expenses to the partnership and us  the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates  on the one hand  and the partnership  on the other hand  including obligations under the omnibus agreement  the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to the partnership s partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of the partnership s business  the determination whether to make borrowings under the capital facility to pay distributions to partners  and any decision we make in the future to engage in activities in competition with the partnership as permitted under our omnibus agreement with the partnership 
if the general partner is not fully reimbursed or indemnified for obligations and liabilities it incurs in managing the business and affairs of the partnership  its value  and therefore the value of our common stock  could decline 
the general partner may make expenditures on behalf of the partnership for which it will seek reimbursement from the partnership 
in addition  under delaware partnership law  the general partner  in its capacity as the general partner of the partnership  has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  such as its debts and environmental liabilities  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
to the extent the general partner incurs obligations on behalf of the partnership  it is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by the general partner 
in the event that the partnership is unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify the general partner  the general partner may be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations  which would reduce its value and therefore the value of our common stock 
acquisitions in the partnership typically increase debt and subject it to other substantial risks  which could adversely affect results of operations 
the partnership s future financial performance will depend  in part  on its ability to make acquisitions of assets and businesses at attractive prices 
from time to time  the partnership will evaluate and seek to acquire assets or businesses that it believes complements existing business and related assets 
the partnership may acquire assets or businesses that it plans to use in a manner materially different from their prior owner s use 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including the inability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses or assets  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses  
table of contents a significant increase in the partnership s indebtedness  and potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems 
management s assessment of these risks is necessarily inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition 
realization of any of these risks could adversely affect the partnership s operations and cash flows 
if the partnership consummates any future acquisition  its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that the partnership will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
the partnership continues to consider large acquisition candidates and transactions 
the integration  financial and other risks discussed above will be amplified if the size of its future acquisitions increases 
the partnership s acquisition strategy is based  in part  on expectation of ongoing divestitures of gas processing and transportation assets by large industry participants 
a material decrease in such divestitures will limit opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect the partnership s growth plans 
the partnership is vulnerable to operational  regulatory and other risks associated with its assets including  with respect to its south louisiana and the gulf of mexico assets  the effects of adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes  because a significant portion of its assets are located in south louisiana 
operations and revenues will be significantly impacted by conditions in south louisiana because the partnership has a significant portion of its assets located in south louisiana 
this concentration of activity makes the partnership more vulnerable than many of its competitors to the risks associated with louisiana and the gulf of mexico  including adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms  delays or decreases in production  the availability of equipment  facilities or services  and changes in the regulatory environment 
because a significant portion of the partnership s operations could experience the same condition at the same time  these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on results of operations than they might have on other midstream companies who have operations in a more diversified geographic area 
in addition  the partnership s operations in south louisiana are dependent upon continued conventional and deep shelf drilling in the gulf of mexico 
the deep shelf in the gulf of mexico is an area that has had limited historical drilling activity 
this is due  in part  to its geological complexity and depth 
deep shelf development is more expensive and inherently more risky than conventional shelf drilling 
a decline in the level of deep shelf drilling in the gulf of mexico could have an adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
the partnership s profitability is dependent upon prices and market demand for natural gas and ngls  which are beyond its control and have been volatile 
the partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these risks are based upon three components of business it purchases certain volumes of natural gas at a price that is a percentage of a relevant index  certain processing contracts for its gregory system and its plaquemine and gibson processing plants expose the partnership to natural gas and ngl commodity price risks  and part of its fees from the conroe and seminole gas plants as well as those acquired in the el paso acquisition are based on a portion of the ngls produced  and  therefore  is subject to commodity price risks 
the margins the partnership realizes from purchasing and selling a portion of the natural gas that it transports through its pipeline systems decrease in periods of low natural gas prices because gross margins related to such purchases are based on a percentage of the index price 
for the years ended december  and  the 
table of contents partnership purchased approximately and  respectively  of its gas at a percentage of relevant index 
accordingly  a decline in the price of natural gas could have an adverse impact on its results of operations 
a portion of the partnership s profitability is affected by the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices 
for a component of the gregory system and the plaquemine plant and gibson plant volumes  natural gas is purchased  processed and ngls are extracted  and then the processed natural gas and ngls are sold 
a portion of profits from the plants acquired in the el paso acquisition is dependent on ngl prices and elections by the partnership and the producers 
in cases where the partnership processes gas for producers when they have the ability to decide whether to process their gas  it may elect to receive a processing fee or it may retain and sell the ngls and keep the producer whole on its sale of natural gas 
since the partnership extracts energy content  which is measured in btu s  from the gas stream in the form of the liquids or consume it as fuel during processing  the partnership reduces the btu content of the natural gas 
accordingly  margins under these arrangements can be negatively affected in periods in which the value of natural gas is high relative to the value of ngls 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile and this volatility is expected to continue 
for example  in  the nymex settlement price for natural gas for the prompt month contract ranged from a high of per mmbtu to a low of per mmbtu 
in  the same index ranged from per mmbtu to per mmbtu 
a composite of the opis mt 
belvieu monthly average liquids price based upon our average liquids composition in ranged from a high of approximately per gallon to a low of approximately per gallon 
in  the same composite ranged from approximately per gallon to approximately per gallon 
as further discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the partnership s processing facilities realized favorable processing margins during  but due to this volatility in the prices of natural gas and ngls  processing margins may be lower in future periods if ngl markets weaken 
the partnership may not be successful in balancing purchases and sales 
in addition  a producer could fail to deliver contracted volumes or deliver in excess of contracted volumes  or a consumer could purchase more or less than contracted volumes 
any of these actions could cause purchases and sales not to be balanced 
if purchases and sales are not balanced  the partnership will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility in operating income 
the markets and prices for residue gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond the partnership s control 
these factors include demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors  including the impact of weather on the demand for oil and natural gas  the level of domestic oil and natural gas production  the level of domestic industrial and manufacturing activity  the availability of imported oil and natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  the availability of local  intrastate and interstate transportation systems  the availability and marketing of competitive fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
the partnership must continually compete for natural gas supplies  and any decrease in its supplies of natural gas could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
if the partnership is unable to maintain or increase the throughput on its systems by accessing new natural gas supplies to offset the natural decline in reserves  business and financial results could be materially  adversely affected 
in addition  the partnership s future growth will depend  in part  upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in currently connected supplies 

table of contents in order to maintain or increase throughput levels in the partnership s natural gas gathering systems and asset utilization rates at its treating and processing plants  it must continually contract for new natural gas supplies 
the partnership may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas supplies 
the primary factors affecting its ability to connect new wells to its gathering facilities include success in contracting for existing natural gas supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity near its gathering systems 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
tax policy changes could have a negative impact on drilling activity  reducing supplies of natural gas available to the partnership s systems 
the partnership has no control over producers and depends on them to maintain sufficient levels of drilling activity 
a material decrease in natural gas production or in the level of drilling activity in its principal geographic areas for a prolonged period  as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise  likely would have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations and financial position 
a substantial portion of the partnership s assets are connected to natural gas reserves that will decline over time  and the cash flows associated with those assets will decline accordingly 
a substantial portion of the partnership s assets  including gathering systems and treating plants  is dedicated to certain natural gas reserves and wells for which the production will naturally decline over time 
accordingly  cash flows associated with these assets will also decline 
if the partnership is unable to access new supplies of natural gas either by connecting additional reserves to existing assets or by constructing or acquiring new assets that have access to additional natural gas reserves  cash flows may decline 
growing the partnership s business by constructing new pipelines and processing and treating facilities subjects the partnership to construction risks  risks that natural gas supplies will not be available upon completion of the facilities and risks of construction delay and additional costs due to obtaining rights of way 
one of the ways the partnership intends to grow business is through the construction of or additions to existing gathering systems and construction of new pipelines and gathering  processing and treating facilities 
the construction of pipelines and gathering  processing and treating facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital  which may exceed the partnership s expectations 
generally  the partnership may have only limited natural gas supplies committed to these facilities prior to their construction 
moreover  the partnership may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize 
the partnership may also rely on estimates of proved reserves in the decision to construct new pipelines and facilities  which may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas to achieve the expected investment return  which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the partnership faces the risks of construction delay and additional costs due to obtaining rights of way and local permits and complying with city ordinances  particularly as it expands operations into more urban  populated areas such as the barnett shale 
the partnership has limited control over the development of certain assets because it is not the operator 
as the owner of non operating interests in the seminole gas processing plant  the partnership does not have the right to direct or control the operation of the plants 
as a result  the success of the activities conducted at this plant  which is operated by a third party  may be affected by factors outside of the partnership s control 
the failure of the third party operator to make decisions  perform its services  discharge its obligations  deal with regulatory agencies or comply with laws  rules and regulations affecting these plants  including environmental laws and regulations  in a proper manner could result in material adverse consequences to the partnership s interest and adversely affect the partnership s results of operations 

table of contents the partnership expects to encounter significant competition in any new geographic areas into which it seeks to expand and the ability to enter such markets may be limited 
as the partnership expands operations into new geographic areas  it expects to encounter significant competition for natural gas supplies and markets 
competitors in these new markets will include companies larger than the partnership  which have both lower capital costs and greater geographic coverage  as well as smaller companies  which have lower total cost structures 
as a result  the partnership may not be able to successfully develop acquired assets and markets located in new geographic areas and the partnership s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the partnership is exposed to the credit risk of customers and counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by the partnership s customers is a major concern in its business 
the partnership is subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by its customers could adversely affect results of the partnership s operations 
the partnership may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers  which would reduce revenues and limit future profitability 
the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond the partnership s control  including competition from other pipelines  and the price of  and demand for  natural gas in the markets it serves 
for the year ended december   approximately of the partnership s sales of gas which were transported using its physical facilities were to industrial end users and utilities 
as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices  end users and utilities are reluctant to enter into long term purchase contracts 
many end users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time 
some of these end users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternate fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market 
because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with the partnership in the marketing of natural gas  the partnership often competes in the end user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price 
the inability of the partnership s management to renew or replace current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on its profitability 
the partnership depends on certain key customers  and the loss of any of its key customers could adversely affect its financial results 
the partnership derives a significant portion of its revenues from contracts with key customers 
to the extent that these and other customers may reduce volumes of natural gas purchased under existing contracts  the partnership would be adversely affected unless it was able to make comparably profitable arrangements with other customers 
agreements with key customers provide for minimum volumes of natural gas that each customer must purchase until the expiration of the term of the applicable agreement  subject to certain force majeure provisions 
customers may default on their obligations to purchase the minimum volumes required under the applicable agreements 
the partnership s business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be fully covered by insurance 
the partnership s operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering  compressing  treating and processing of natural gas and storage of residue gas  including damage to pipelines  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes  floods  fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism  
table of contents inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leaks of natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  and fires and explosions 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of the partnership s related operations 
the partnership s operations are concentrated in texas  louisiana and the mississippi gulf coast  and a natural disaster or other hazard affecting this region could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
the partnership is not fully insured against all risks incident to its business 
in accordance with typical industry practice  the partnership does not have any property insurance on any of its underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines 
it is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur  other than those considered to be sudden and accidental 
business interruption insurance covers only the gregory processing plant 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect operations and financial condition 
the threat of terrorist attacks has resulted in increased costs  and future war or risk of war may adversely impact the partnership s results of operations and its ability to raise capital 
terrorist attacks or the threat of terrorist attacks cause instability in the global financial markets and other industries  including the energy industry 
uncertainty surrounding retaliatory military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect the partnership s operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  and transmission and distribution facilities  could be direct targets  or indirect casualties  of an act of terror 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism  the war in iraq or future developments could also affect the partnership s ability to raise capital 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to the threat of terrorist attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for the partnership to obtain 
the partnership s insurance policies now generally exclude acts of terrorism 
such insurance is not available at what the partnership considers to be acceptable pricing levels 
a lower level of economic activity could also result in a decline in energy consumption  which could adversely affect revenues or restrict future growth 
federal  state or local regulatory measures could adversely affect the partnership s business 
while ferc generally does not regulate any of the partnership s operations  ferc influences certain aspects of its business and the market for its products 
the rates  terms and conditions of service under which the partnership transports natural gas on its pipeline systems in interstate commerce are subject to ferc regulation under section of the ngpa 
the partnership s intrastate natural gas pipeline operations generally are not subject to rate regulation by ferc  but they are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located 
should ferc or any of these state agencies determine that our rates for section transportation service or intrastate transportation service should be lowered  its business could be adversely affected 
the partnership s gas gathering activities generally are exempt from ferc regulation and nga 
however  the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial  on going litigation  so the classification and regulation of the partnership s gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc and the courts 
natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels since ferc has less extensively regulated the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates 
the partnership s gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of gathering facilities 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such changes might have on the partnership s operations  but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 

table of contents other state and local regulations also affect the partnership s business 
it is subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states where it operates 
ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take  without undue discrimination  natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling 
similarly  common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes have the effect of restricting the partnership s right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas 
federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states  and some of the states in which it operates have adopted complaint based or other limited economic regulation of natural gas gathering activities 
states in which the partnership operates that have adopted some form of complaint based regulation  like oklahoma and texas  generally allow natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination 
the states in which the partnership conducts operations administer federal pipeline safety standards under the pipeline safety act of the rural gathering exemption under the natural gas pipeline safety act of presently exempts substantial portions of the partnership s gathering facilities from jurisdiction under that statute  including those portions located outside of cities  towns  or any area designated as residential or commercial  such as a subdivision or shopping center 
the rural gathering exemption  however  may be restricted in the future  and it does not apply to the partnership s natural gas transmission pipelines 
in response to recent pipeline accidents in other parts of the country  congress and the department of transportation  or dot  have passed or are considering heightened pipeline safety requirements 
compliance with pipeline integrity regulations issued by the trrc  or those issued by the united states department of transportation in december of could result in substantial expenditures for testing  repairs and replacement 
trrc regulations require periodic testing of all intrastate pipelines meeting certain size and location requirements 
the partnership s costs relating to compliance with the required testing under the trrc regulations were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and it expects the costs for compliance with trrc and dot regulations to be million during if the partnership s pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the trrc or the dot regulations  then the partnership may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines  the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time 
as the operations of the partnership continue to expand into and around urban  populated areas  such as the barnett shale  it will have more compliance requirements with local ordinances and other restrictions imposed by cities and towns  such as noise ordinances and restrictions on facility locations and pressures 
these requirements could result in increased costs and construction delays 
the partnership s business involves hazardous substances and may be adversely affected by environmental regulation 
many of the operations and activities of the partnership s gathering systems  plants and other facilities  including the natural gas and processing liquids business in south louisiana recently acquired from el paso  are subject to significant federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations impose obligations related to air emissions and discharge of pollutants from the partnership s facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances and other wastes that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by the partnership or locations to which it has sent wastes for treatment or disposal 
various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and the permits issued under them  and violators are subject to administrative  civil and criminal penalties  including civil fines  injunctions or both 
strict  joint and several liability may be incurred under these laws and regulations for the remediation of contaminated areas 
private parties  including the owners of properties through which the partnership s gathering systems pass  may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage 
there is inherent risk of the incurrence of significant environmental costs and liabilities in the partnership s business due to its handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions related to the partnership s operations  historical industry operations  waste disposal practices and the prior use of natural gas flow meters 
table of contents containing mercury 
in addition  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the partnership s compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
the partnership may incur material environmental costs and liabilities 
furthermore  insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against the partnership 
the partnership s business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits 
new environmental regulations might adversely affect the partnership s products and activities  including processing  storage and transportation  as well as waste management and air emissions 
federal and state agencies could also impose additional safety requirements  any of which could affect the partnership s profitability 
the use of derivative financial instruments has in the past and could in the future result in financial losses or reduce income 
the partnership uses over the counter price and basis swaps with other natural gas merchants and financial institutions  and it uses futures and option contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
use of these instruments is intended to reduce exposure to short term volatility in commodity prices 
the partnership could incur financial losses or fail to recognize the full value of a market opportunity as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if one of its counterparties fails to perform under a contract 
due to the partnership s lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in gathering  transmission  treating  processing and commercial services businesses would materially impact its financial condition 
the partnership relies exclusively on the revenues generated from its gathering  transmission  treating  processing and commercial services businesses  and as a result its financial condition depends upon prices of  and continued demand for  natural gas and ngls 
due to its lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in one of these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets 
the partnership s success depends on key members of management  the loss or replacement of whom could disrupt its business operations 
the partnership depends on the continued employment and performance of the officers of crosstex energy gp  llc and key operational personnel 
crosstex energy gp  llc enters into employment agreements with each of its executive officers 
if any of these officers or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  the partnership s business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the partnership does not maintain any key man life insurance for any officers

the partnership has obtained  where necessary  easement agreements from public authorities and railroad companies to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along  watercourses  county roads  municipal streets  railroad properties and state highways  as applicable 
in some cases  property on which the partnership s pipeline was built was purchased in fee 
the partnership s processing plants are located on land that it leases or owns in fee 
their treating facilities are generally located on sites provided by producers or other parties 

table of contents we believe that the partnership has satisfactory title to all of its rights of way and land assets 
title to these assets may be subject to encumbrances or defects 
we believe that none of such encumbrances or defects should materially detract from the value of the partnership s assets or from the partnership s interest in these assets or should materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 
item legal proceedings our operations and those of the partnership are subject to a variety of risks and disputes normally incident to our business 
as a result  at any given time we or the partnership may be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
these include litigation on disputes related to contracts  property rights  use or damage and personal injury 
additionally  as the partnership continues to expand operations into more urban  populated areas  such as the barnett shale  it may see an increase in claims brought by area landowners  such as nuisance claims and other claims based on property rights 
except as otherwise set forth herein  we do not believe that any pending or threatened claim or dispute is material to our financial results or our operations 
we maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent 
however  this insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 
on november   crosstex ccng processing ltd 
crosstex ccng  a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership  received a demand letter from denbury onshore  llc denbury  asserting a claim for breach of contract and seeking payment of approximately million in damages 
the claim arises from a contract under which crosstex ccng processed natural gas owned or controlled by denbury in north texas 
denbury contends that crosstex ccng breached the contract by failing to build a processing plant of a certain size and design  resulting in crosstex ccng s failure to properly process the gas over a ten month period 
denbury also alleges that crosstex ccng failed to provide specific notices required under the contract 
on december   and again on february   denbury sent crosstex ccng letters demanding that its claim be arbitrated pursuant to an arbitration provision in the contract 
denbury subsequently requested that the parties attempt to mediate the matter before any arbitration proceeding initiated 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of this matter  we do not believe this will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

overview crosstex energy  inc is a delaware corporation formed on april  to engage in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls through its subsidiaries 
on july   we formed crosstex energy  lp  a delaware limited partnership  to acquire indirectly substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of its predecessor  crosstex energy services  ltd 
our assets consist almost exclusively of partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp  a publicly traded limited partnership engaged in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas and ngls 
these partnership interests consist of i  common units  representing approximately of the limited partner interests in crosstex energy  lp  and ii ownership interest in crosstex energy gp  lp  the general partner of crosstex energy  lp  which owns a general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in crosstex energy  lp 
table of contents our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
the partnership is required by its partnership agreement to distribute all its cash on hand at the end of each quarter  less reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business or to provide for future distributions 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter  and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
distributions by the partnership have increased from per unit for the quarter ended march  its first full quarter of operation after its initial public offering to per unit for the quarter ended december  as a result  our distributions from the partnership pursuant to our ownership of common units and subordinated units excluding senior subordinated series c units have increased from million for the quarter ended march  to million for the quarter ended december   our distributions pursuant to our general partner interest have increased from  to million  and our distributions pursuant to our incentive distribution rights have increased from zero to million 
the senior subordinated series c units were not entitled to receive distributions until they converted to common units in february as a result  we have increased our dividend from per share for the quarter ended march  giving effect to the three for one stock split on december  to per share for the quarter ended december  since we control the general partner interest in the partnership  we reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with the partnership s financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries 
the interest owned by non controlling partners share of income is reflected as an expense in our results of operations 
we have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership  and our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
our consolidated results of operations are derived from the results of operations of the partnership and also include our gains on the issuance of units in the partnership  deferred taxes  interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income  interest income expense and general and administrative expenses not reflected in the partnership s results of operation 
accordingly  the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the partnership 
the partnership has two industry segments  midstream and treating  with a geographic focus in north texas  in south texas  in louisiana and in mississippi 
the partnership s midstream division focuses on the gathering  processing  transmission and marketing of natural gas and ngls  as well as providing certain producer services  while the treating division focuses on the removal of contaminants from natural gas and ngls to meet pipeline quality specifications 
for the year ended december   of the partnership s gross margin was generated in the midstream division  with the balance in the treating division 
the partnership focuses on gross margin to manage its business because its business is generally to purchase and resell natural gas for a margin  or to gather  process  transport  market or treat natural gas or ngls for a fee 
the partnership buys and sells most of its natural gas at a fixed relationship to the relevant index price so margins are not significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices 
as explained under commodity price risk below  it enters into financial instruments to reduce volatility in gross margin due to price fluctuations 
during the past five years  the partnership has grown significantly as a result of construction and acquisition of gathering and transmission pipelines and treating and processing plants 
from january  through december   it has invested over billion to develop or acquire new assets 
the purchased assets were acquired from numerous sellers at different periods and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations for such acquisitions are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of the acquisition 
as a consequence  the historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable 
the partnership s midstream segment margins are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  transported  purchased and sold through its pipeline systems  processed at its processing facilities and the 
table of contents volumes of ngls handled at its fractionation facilities 
treating segment margins are largely a function of the number and size of treating plants as well as fees earned for removing impurities from ngls at a non operated processing plant 
the partnership generates revenues from six primary sources purchasing and reselling or transporting natural gas on the pipeline systems it owns  processing natural gas at its processing plants and fractionating and marketing the recovered ngls  treating natural gas at its treating plants  recovering carbon dioxide and ngls at a non operated processing plant  providing compression services  and providing off system marketing services for producers 
the bulk of the partnership s operating profits has historically derived from the margins it realizes for gathering and transporting natural gas and ngls through its pipeline systems 
generally  the partnership gathers and transports gas owned by others through its facilities for a fee  or it buys gas from a producer  plant  or transporter at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index  then transports and resells the gas 
in the partnership s purchase sale transactions  the resale price is generally based on the same index price at which the gas was purchased  and  if the partnership is to be profitable  at a smaller discount or larger premium to the index than it was purchased 
the partnership attempts to execute all purchases and sales substantially concurrently  or it enters into a future delivery obligation  thereby establishing the basis for the margin it will receive for each natural gas transaction 
the partnership s gathering and transportation margins related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas 
see commodity price risk below for a discussion of how it manages its business to reduce the impact of price volatility 
processing and fractionation revenues are largely fee based 
processing fees are largely based on either a percentage of the liquids volume recovered  or a fixed fee per unit processed 
fractionation and marketing fees are generally fixed per unit of product 
the partnership generates treating revenues under three arrangements a volumetric fee based on the amount of gas treated  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  a fixed fee for operating the plant for a certain period  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  or a fee arrangement in which the producer operates the plant  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset 
among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision and associated transportation and communication costs  property insurance  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  measurement and utilities 
these costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges  and therefore  do not normally decrease or increase significantly in the short term with decreases or increases in the volume of gas moved through the asset 
acquisitions and expansions the partnership has grown significantly through asset purchases and undertaking construction and expansion projects in recent years  which creates many of the major differences when comparing operating results from one period to another 
the most significant asset purchases since january were the acquisitions of midstream assets from chief holdings llc chief in june  the hanover compression company treating assets in february and the acquisition of the amine treating business of cardinal gas solutions lp in october in addition  internal expansion projects in north texas and louisiana have contributed to the increase in the partnership s business 

table of contents on june   the partnership expanded its operations in the north texas area through its acquisition of the natural gas gathering pipeline systems and related facilities of chief in the barnett shale for million 
the acquired systems  which is referred to in conjunction with the ntp and other facilities in the area as the partnership s north texas assets  included gathering pipeline  a mmcf d carbon dioxide treating plant and compression facilities with  horsepower 
at the closing of that acquisition  approximately  net acres previously owned by chief and acquired by devon energy corporation  or devon  simultaneously with its acquisition  as well as  net acres owned by other producers  were dedicated to the systems 
immediately following the closing of the chief acquisition  the partnership began expanding its north texas pipeline gathering system 
since the date of the acquisition through december   the partnership connected new wells to its gathering system and significantly increased the dedicated acreage owned by other producers 
in addition  the partnership has a total of  horsepower of compression to handle the increased volumes and provide low pressure gathering service 
in september  the partnership increased processing capacity in the area by constructing a mmcf d cryogenic processing plant  referred to as the silver creek plant  in addition to its mmcf d cryogenic processing plant  referred to as the azle plant  and its mmcf d processing plant  known as the goforth plant 
the partnership has also installed two gallon per minute and one gallon per minute amine treating plants to provide carbon dioxide removal capability 
the partnership has total capacity of approximately mmcf d on our north texas gathering assets and has increased total throughput on its north texas gathering systems from approximately  mmbtu d at the time of the chief acquisition to approximately  mmbtu d for the month of december on february   the partnership acquired amine treating plants from a subsidiary of hanover compression company for million 
on october   the partnership acquired the amine treating business of cardinal gas solutions limited partnership for million 
the acquisition added dew point control plants and of seven amine treating plants to its plant portfolio 
on march   the partnership acquired the remaining interest in the amine treating plants for approximately million 
the partnership s ntp  which commenced service in april  consists of a mile pipeline and associated gathering lines from an area near fort worth  texas to a point near paris  texas 
the initial capacity of the ntp was approximately mmcf d 
in  the partnership expanded the capacity on the ntp to a total of approximately mmcf d 
the ntp connects production from the barnett shale to markets in north texas and to markets accessed by the natural gas pipeline company  or ngpl  kinder morgan  houston pipeline  or hpl  atmos and other markets 
as of december  the total throughput on ntp was approximately  mmbtu d 
the ntp will interconnect with a new intrastate gas pipeline to be constructed by boardwalk pipeline partners  lp known as the gulf crossing pipeline 
the gulf crossing pipeline will provide our customers access to premium midwest and east coast markets 
the partnership has committed to contract for  mmbtu d for ten years of firm transportation capacity on the gulf crossing pipeline when it commences service  which is expected in the fourth quarter of the partnership is currently constructing a new mile natural gas gathering pipeline in north johnson county  texas  to provide greater takeaway capacity to natural gas producers in the barnett shale 
the system will include low pressure and high pressure gathering pipelines with an estimated capacity of approximately mmcf d when all phases of the pipeline are complete  which is planned for the second quarter of the initial phase of this project was completed in september and the facilities were transporting approximately  mmbtu d in the fourth quarter of in april  the partnership completed construction and commenced operations on its north louisiana expansion  which is an extension of its lig system  designed to increase take away pipeline capacity to the producers developing natural gas in the fields south of shreveport  louisiana 
the north louisiana expansion consists of approximately miles of mainline with miles of gathering lateral pipeline and  horsepower of new compression 
the capacity of the expansion is approximately mmcf d  and  as of december   the expansion was flowing at approximately  mmbtu d 
interconnects on the north louisiana expansion include connections with the interstate pipelines of anr pipeline  columbia gulf transmission  texas gas transmission and trunkline gas 

table of contents other assets we own two inactive gas plants in addition to our limited and general partner interests in the partnership 
the two gas plants are the jonesville processing plant  which has been largely inactive since the beginning of  and the clarkson plant  acquired shortly before the partnership s initial public offering 
in the third quarter of  we fully impaired our investment in the jonesville plant 
impact of federal income taxes crosstex energy  inc is a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as such  our federal taxable income is subject to tax at a maximum rate of under current law 
we expect to have significant amounts of taxable income allocated to us as a result of our investment in the partnership s units  particularly because of remedial allocations that will be made among the unitholders and because of the general partner s incentive distribution rights  which we will benefit from as the sole owner of the general partner 
taxable income allocated to us by the partnership will increase over the years as the ratio of income to distributions increases for all of the unitholders 
as of december  we have a net operating loss carryforward of million for federal income taxes and state loss carryforwards of million 
we believe it is more likely than not that our future results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
once these net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized  we will have to pay tax on our federal taxable income at a maximum rate of under current law 
thus  the amount of money available to make cash distributions to our stockholders will decrease markedly after we use all of our net operating loss carryforward 
our use of this net operating loss carryforward will be limited if there is a greater than change in our stock ownership over a three year period 
commodity price risk the partnership s profitability has been and will continue to be affected by volatility in prevailing ngl product and natural gas prices 
changes in the prices of ngl products can correlate closely with changes in the price of crude oil 
ngl product and natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for crude oil  ngl products and natural gas 
profitability under the partnership s gas processing contracts is impacted by the margin between ngl sales prices and the cost of natural gas and may be negatively affected by decreases in ngl prices or increases in natural gas prices 
changes in natural gas prices impact profitability since the purchase price of a portion of the gas the partnership buys is based on a percentage of a particular natural gas price index for a period  while the gas is resold at a fixed dollar relationship to the same index 
therefore  during periods of low gas prices  these contracts can be less profitable than during periods of higher gas prices 
however  on most of the gas bought and sold  margins are not affected by such changes because the gas is bought and sold at a fixed relationship to the relevant index 
therefore  while changes in the price of gas can have very large impacts on revenues and cost of revenues  the changes are equal and offsetting 
set forth in the table below is the volume of the natural gas purchased and sold at a fixed discount or premium to the index price and at a percentage discount or premium to the index price for the partnership s principal gathering and transmission systems and for its commercial services business for the year ended december  year ended december  gas purchased gas sold fixed fixed amount percentage of amount percentage of asset or business to index index to index index in thousands of mmbtu s lig system south texas system north texas system other assets and activities 
table of contents gas sold is less than gas purchased due to production of ngls on certain assets included in the south texas system and other assets 
lig plants purchase the gathering system plant thermal reduction ptr 
the partnership estimates that  due to the gas that it purchases at a percentage of index price  for each per mmbtu increase or decrease in the price of natural gas  its gross margins increase or decrease by approximately million on an annual basis before consideration of hedge positions 
as of december   it has hedged approximately of its exposure to such fluctuations in natural gas prices for and approximately of its exposure to such fluctuations for celp expects to continue to hedge its exposure to gas prices when market opportunities appear attractive 
the partnership processed approximately of its volumes during at eunice  pelican  sabine and blue water under percent of proceeds contracts  under which it receives as a fee a portion of the liquids produced  and of its volume as fixed fee per unit processed 
under percent of proceeds contracts  it is exposed to changes in the prices of ngls 
for the years and  it has purchased puts or entered into forward sales covering all of its anticipated minimum share of ngls production 
for we have hedges in place covering approximately of the liquid volumes we expect to receive through may the partnership s processing plants at plaquemine and gibson have a variety of processing contract structures 
in general  the partnership buys gas under keep whole arrangements in which it bears the risk of processing  percentage of proceeds arrangements in which it receives a percentage of the value of the liquids recovered  and theoretical processing arrangements in which the settlement with the producer is based on an assumed processing result 
because the partnership has the ability to bypass certain volumes when processing is uneconomic  it can limit its exposure to adverse processing margins 
during periods when processing margins are favorable  the partnership can substantially increase the volumes it is processing 
for the year ended december   the partnership purchased a small amount approximately of the natural gas volumes on its gregory system under contracts in which it was exposed to the risk of loss or gain in processing the natural gas 
the partnership purchased the remaining approximately of the natural gas volumes on its gregory system at a spot or market price less a discount that includes a fixed margin for gathering  processing and marketing the natural gas and ngls at its gregory processing plant with no risk of loss or gain in processing the natural gas 
the partnership owns an undivided interest in the seminole gas processing plant  which is located in gaines county  texas 
the seminole plant has dedicated long term reserves from the seminole san andres unit  to which it also supplies carbon dioxide under a long term arrangement 
revenues at the plant are derived from a fee it charges producers for each mcf of carbon dioxide returned to the producer for reinjection 
the fees currently average approximately for each mcf of carbon dioxide returned 
reinjected carbon dioxide is used in a tertiary oil recovery process in the field 
the plant also receives of the ngls produced by the plant 
therefore  the partnership has commodity price exposure due to variances in the prices of ngls 
during  its share of ngls totaled million gallons at an average price of per gallon 
gas prices can also affect the partnership s profitability indirectly by influencing drilling activity and related opportunities for gas gathering  treating and processing 

table of contents results of operations set forth in the table below is certain financial and operating data for the midstream and treating divisions for the periods indicated 
years ended december  dollars in millions midstream revenues midstream purchased gas profits on energy trading activities midstream gross margin treating revenues treating purchased gas treating gross margin total gross margin midstream volumes mmbtu d gathering and transportation processing producer services treating plants in operation at year end year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin and profit on energy trading activities 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to system expansions  increased system throughput and a favorable processing environment for natural gas and ngls 
the partnership acquired the ntg assets from chief in june system expansion in the north texas region and increased throughput on the north texas pipeline ntp contributed million of gross margin growth during the year ended december  over the same period in the ntg and ntp assets accounted for million and million of this increase  respectively 
the processing facilities in the region contributed an additional million of this gross margin increase 
operational improvements  system expansion and increased volume on the lig system coupled with optimization and integration with the south louisiana processing assets contributed margin growth of million for volume increases on the mississippi system contributed gross margin growth of million 
the plaquemine and gibson plants contributed margin growth of million due to a favorable gas processing environment 
the favorable gas processing margin also led to a combined million margin increase on the vanderbilt and gulf coast systems 
the favorable processing margins the partnership realized during at several of its processing facilities may be higher than margins it may realize during future periods if the ngl markets do not remain as strong as they were during as discussed above under commodity price risk  the partnership receives a portion of liquids processed or a percentage of the liquids recovered as a processing fee on a substantial portion of the gas processed through these plants 
during periods when processing margins are favorable  as existed during  it experiences higher processing margins 
the partnership has the ability to bypass certain volumes when processing is uneconomic so it can limit its exposure to adverse processing margins but processing margins will be lower during these periods 
in addition  the partnership has the ability to buy gas from and to sell gas to various gas markets through its pipeline systems 
during the partnership was able to benefit from price differentials between the various gas markets by selling gas into markets with more favorable pricing thereby improving its midstream gross margin 
if these price differentials do not exist in future periods  midstream gross margin may be lower 
treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
there were approximately treating and dew point 
table of contents control plants in service at december  this number was unchanged from december  gross margin growth for the period is attributed to a higher average number of plants in service each month during compared to operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in operating expenses primarily reflects costs associated with growth and expansion in the north texas assets of million  the south texas assets of million  the lig and the north louisiana expansion assets of million  and treating assets of million 
operating expenses included million of stock based compensation expenses in compared to million of stock based compensation expense in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
additions to headcount associated with the requirements of ntp and ntg assets and the expansion in north louisiana accounted for million of the increase 
consulting for system and process improvements resulted in million of the increase 
general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of million and million in and  respectively

other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in we collected million in excess of the carrying value of the enron account receivable net of the allowance 

table of contents gain on issuance of units of the partnership 
as a result of the partnership issuing common units in december to unrelated parties at a price per unit greater than our equivalent carrying value  our share of net assets of the partnership increased by million and we recognized a gain on issuance of such units 
in  we recognized a million gain associated with the issuance in june of senior subordinated units when the senior subordinated units converted to common units in february income taxes

interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income 
the interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income increased by million to a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  due to the changes shown in the following summary in thousands for the year ended december  net income for the partnership income allocation to cei for the general partner incentive distribution stock based compensation costs allocated to cei for its stock options and restricted stock granted to partnership officers  employees and directors income loss allocation to cei for its general partner share of partnership income loss net income loss allocable to limited partners less cei s share of net income loss allocable to limited partners plus non controlling partners share of net income loss in crosstex denton county gathering  jv non controlling partners share of partnership net income loss the general partner incentive distributions increased between these years due to an increase in the distribution amounts per unit and due to an increase in the number of common units outstanding year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin and profit on energy trading activities 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to acquisitions  increased system throughput and a favorable processing environment for natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the south louisiana processing assets acquired in november contributed million to midstream gross margin growth in this amount was driven by the three largest processing plants  eunice  pelican and sabine pass  which contributed gross margin increases of million  million and million  respectively 
the riverside fractionation facility and the blue water plant also contributed gross margin growth to the south louisiana operations of million and million  respectively 
operational improvements and volume increases on the lig system contributed margin growth of million during increased processing volumes at the gibson and plaquemine plants due to drilling successes by producers and increased unit margins due to favorable ngl markets accounted for a million increase in gross margin 
the partnership acquired the north texas gathering system from chief in june this gathering system and related facilities contributed million of gross margin during the ntp commenced operation during the second quarter of and contributed million in gross margin 
these gains were partially offset by volume and margin declines on our southern region assets 
decreased throughput on the south texas systems contributed to an overall margin decrease in our southern region of million 

table of contents treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
treating plants in service increased from plants at december to plants excluding dew point control plants in service at december the increase in the number of plants in service is primarily due to the acquisition of the amine treating assets from hanover compressor company in february of new plants associated with the hanover acquisition contributed million in gross margin growth 
the field services acquired from hanover also contributed million in gross margin for the year 
plant additions from inventory and expansion projects at existing plants contributed gross margin growth of million and million  respectively 
the seminole plant contributed million of gross margin growth due to the recalculation of fees based on rate escalations set forth in the contract 
the acquisition and installation of dew point control plants contributed an additional million increase to gross margin

income after minority interest also decreased million between years which also reduced the income tax expense between years 
gain on issuance of units of the partnership 
as a result of the partnership issuing common units in june to unrelated parties at a price per unit greater than our equivalent carrying value  our share of net assets of the partnership increased by million 
we recognized the million gain associated with the unit issuance in february when the senior subordinated units converted to common units 
we recognized a gain of million during associated with the partnership s issuance of common units in november interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income 
the interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income decreased by million to a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to income of million for the year ended december  due to the changes shown in the following summary in thousands for the years ended december  net income for the partnership income allocation to cei for the general partner incentive distribution stock based compensation costs allocated to cei for its stock options and restricted stock granted to partnership officers  employees and directors income loss allocation to cei for its general partner share of partnership income loss net income loss allocable to limited partners less cei s share of net income loss allocable to limited partners plus non controlling partners share of net income loss in crosstex denton county gathering  j

critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
compliance with the rules necessarily involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our accounting policies and a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
revenue recognition and commodity risk management 
the partnership recognizes revenue for sales or services at the time the natural gas or ngls are delivered or at the time the service is performed 
it generally accrues one to two months of sales and the related gas purchases and reverse these accruals when the sales and purchases are actually invoiced and recorded in the subsequent months 
actual results could differ from the accrual estimates 
the partnership utilizes extensive estimation procedures to determine the sales and cost of gas purchase accruals for each accounting cycle 
accruals are based on estimates of volumes flowing each month from a variety of sources 
it uses actual measurement data  if it is available  and will use such data as producer shipper nominations  prior month average daily flows  estimated flow for new production and estimated end user requirements all adjusted for the estimated impact of weather patterns when actual measurement data is not available 
throughout the month or two following production  actual measured sales and transportation volumes are received and invoiced and used in a process referred to as actualization 
through the actualization process  any estimation differences recorded through the accrual are reflected in the subsequent month s accounting cycle when the accrual is reversed and actual amounts are recorded 
actual volumes purchased  processed or sold may differ from the estimates due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to actual wellhead production or customer requirements being higher or lower than the amount nominated at the beginning of the month  liquids recoveries being higher or lower than estimated because gas processed through the plants was richer or leaner than estimated  the estimated impact of weather patterns being different from the actual impact on sales and purchases  and pipeline maintenance or allocation causing actual deliveries of gas to be different than estimated 
the partnership believes that its accrual process for the one to two months of sales and purchases provides a reasonable estimate of such sales and purchases 
the partnership engages in price risk management activities in order to minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
the partnership uses derivatives to hedge against changes in cash flows related to product prices and interest rates risks  as opposed to their use for trading purposes 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that all derivatives and hedging instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the partnership conducts off system gas marketing operations as a service to producers on systems that it does not own 
the partnership refers to these activities as part of energy trading activities 
in some cases  the partnership earns an agency fee from the producer for arranging the marketing of the producer s natural gas 
in other 
table of contents cases  the partnership purchases the natural gas from the producer and enters into a sales contract with another party to sell the natural gas 
the revenue and cost of sales for these activities are shown net in the statement of operations 
we manage our price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for energy trading activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance future commitments and significantly reduce risk related to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  we are subject to counter party risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
our energy trading contracts qualify as derivatives  and we use mark to market accounting for both physical and financial contracts of the energy trading business 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to energy trading activities are recognized in earnings as gain or loss on derivatives immediately 
net realized gains and losses on settled contracts are reported in profit on energy trading activities 
sales of securities by subsidiaries 
we recognize gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations resulting from subsidiary sales of additional equity interest  including the partnership s limited partnership units  to unrelated parties 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the purchase and resale margins on natural gas  volume of gas available to the asset  markets available to the asset  operating expenses  and future natural gas prices and ngl product prices 
the amount of availability of gas to an asset is sometimes based on assumptions regarding future drilling activity  which may be dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of gas volumes and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located  the availability and prices of natural gas supply  the partnership s ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements  the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  the partnership s dependence on certain significant customers  producers  and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other midstream companies  including major energy producers 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
depreciation expense and cost capitalization 
our assets consist primarily of natural gas gathering pipelines  processing plants  transmission pipelines and natural gas treating plants owned by the partnership 
we capitalize all construction related direct labor and material costs  as well as indirect construction costs 
indirect construction costs include general engineering and the costs of funds used in construction 
capitalized interest represents the cost of funds used to finance the construction of new facilities and is expensed over the life of the constructed assets through the recording of depreciation expense 
we capitalize the costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life  while we expense the costs of repairs  replacements and maintenance projects as incurred 
we generally compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
certain assets such as land  ngl line pack and natural gas line pack are non depreciable 
the computation of 
table of contents depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage value of assets 
as circumstances warrant  we may review depreciation estimates to determine if any changes are needed 
such changes could involve an increase or decrease in estimated useful lives or salvage values  which would impact future depreciation expense

credit risk we are diligent in attempting to ensure that we issue credit to only credit worthy customers 
however  the partnership s purchase and resale of gas and ngls exposes it to significant credit risk  as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sale price 
therefore  a credit loss can be very large relative to its overall profitability 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years in economy as a whole 
the midstream natural gas industry has experienced an increase in labor and material costs during the year  although these increases did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees

contingencies on november   crosstex ccng received a demand letter from denbury asserting a claim for breach of contract and seeking payment of approximately million in damages 
the claim arises from a contract under which crosstex ccng processed natural gas owned or controlled by denbury in north texas 
denbury contends that crosstex ccng breached the contract by failing to build a processing plant of a certain size and design  resulting in crosstex ccng s failure to properly process the gas over a ten month period 
denbury also alleges that crosstex ccng failed to provide specific notices required under the contract 
on december  and again on february   denbury sent crosstex ccng letters demanding that its claim be arbitrated pursuant to an arbitration provision in the contract 
denbury subsequently requested that the parties attempt to mediate the matter before any arbitration proceeding is initiated 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of this matter  we do not believe this will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the partnership s primary market risk is the risk related to changes in the prices of natural gas and ngls 
in addition  it is exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
interest rate risk the partnership is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate bank credit facility 
at december  and  the bank credit facility had outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively  which approximated fair value 
the partnership manages a portion of its interest rate exposure on variable rate debt by utilizing interest rate swaps  which allows conversion of a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the partnership entered into interest rate swaps in covering million of the variable rate debt for a period of three years at interest rates ranging from to coverage periods end from november through october 
as of december   the fair value of these interest rate swaps was reflected as a liability of million million in current liabilities and million in long term liabilities on the financial statements 
the partnership estimates that a increase or decrease in the interest rate would increase or decrease the fair value of these interest rate swaps by approximately million 
considering the interest rate swaps and the amount outstanding on its bank credit facility as of december   the partnership estimates that a increase or decrease in the interest rate would change its annual interest expense by approximately million for periods when the entire portion of the million of interest rate swaps are outstanding and million for annual periods after when all the interest rate swaps lapse 
at december  and  the partnership had total fixed rate debt obligations of million and million  respectively  consisting of its senior secured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 
the fair value of these fixed rate obligations was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the partnership estimates that a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the fixed rated debt its senior secured notes by million based on the debt obligations as of december  commodity price risk approximately of the natural gas the partnership markets is purchased at a percentage of the relevant natural gas index price  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the natural gas at a percentage of the index price  resale margins are higher during periods of high natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices 
as of december   the partnership has hedged approximately of its exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through december and approximately of its exposure to natural gas price fluctuations for another price risk the partnership faces is the risk of mismatching volumes of gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price 
the partnership enters each month with a balanced book of gas bought and sold on the same basis 
however  it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of gas bought or 
table of contents sold under either basis  which leaves it with short or long positions that must be covered 
the partnership uses financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position 
the partnership also has hedges in place covering liquids volumes it expects to receive under percent of proceeds contracts 
at its south louisiana plants  it has hedged approximately of exposure through may and at various levels less than from june through the first quarter of other partnership assets  have hedged approximately of their exposure through june and at various levels less than from july through the first quarter of the partnership has commodity price risk associated with its processed volumes of natural gas 
the partnership currently processes gas under four main types of contractual arrangements keep whole contracts under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant  and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost shrink in processing 
the partnership s margins from these contracts are high during periods of high liquids prices relative to natural gas prices  and can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
the partnership controls its risk on our current keep whole contracts through its ability to bypass processing when it is not profitable 
percent of proceeds contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered  and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink 
therefore  its margins from these contracts are greater during periods of high liquids prices 
the partnership s margins from processing cannot become negative under percent of proceeds contracts  but decline during periods of low ngl prices 
theoretical processing contracts under these contracts  the partnership stipulates with the producer the assumptions under which it will assume processing economics for settlement purposes  independent of actual processing results or whether the stream was actually processed 
these contracts tend to have an inverse result to the keep whole contracts  with better margins as processing economics worsen 
fee based contracts under these contracts the partnership has no commodity price exposure  and is paid a fixed fee per unit of volume that is treated or conditioned 
the partnership s primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows 
the partnership maintains a risk management committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
the partnership enters into hedges for natural gas and ngls using nymex futures or over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by its risk management committee 
the use of financial instruments may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that the partnership engages in hedging activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  the partnership is similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
as of december   outstanding natural gas swap agreements  ngl swap agreements  swing swap agreements  storage swap agreements and other derivative instruments were a net fair value liability of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical increase in gas and ngls prices would result in an increase of approximately million in the net fair value liability of these contracts as of december
