critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments reflect practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  recoverability evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring charges  valuation reserve for deferred tax assets  business combinations  and stock based compensation 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our disclosure committee and the audit committee of our board of directors 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements  contained elsewhere in this report  contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from three sources maintenance and support services  subscription fees from clients accessing our on demand software  which we also refer to as on demand subscriptions and hosting arrangements  all of which we refer to as subscriptions and support sales  services performed in connection with consulting agreements and sales of software licenses and related products 
sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis 

table of contents revenue derived from software licenses and related products is subject to the guidance and requirements of aicpa sop no 
 as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
revenue from our on demand subscriptions is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in the event of a multiple element arrangement we evaluate the transaction as if each element represents a separate unit of accounting taking into account all factors following the guidelines set forth in sop no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with these standards  we recognize revenue when all of the following four conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for the vast majority of transactions  we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by our customer and us to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
for maintenance renewals  an arrangement is evidenced by cash collection or a customer purchase order  delivery has occurred 
in perpetual licensing arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred when the software has been delivered to our customer in the manner prescribed in the contractual arrangement and there are no further performance obligations 
services including professional services  maintenance  and hosting and our on demand subscriptions are typically considered delivered as performed  fee is fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than ninety days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
in these cases or if the arrangement price is subject to refund  concession or other adjustment  then we consider the fee to not be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is deferred and recognized when payments become due and payable  or the right to refund or adjustment lapses  and collection is probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until cash collection 
we sell both perpetual and time based software licenses 
our customers may or may not purchase with licenses the following i support services that provides for technical support and product updates  generally over renewable month periods  ii professional services including consulting and training  and iii hosting 
depending upon the elements and the terms of the arrangement  we recognize license revenues under the residual method or the contract accounting method 
residual method 
license fees are recognized upon delivery whether sold separately or together with other services  described above  provided that i the revenue recognition requirements above have been met  ii payment of the license fees is not dependent on any implementation or performance criteria  iii the related services do not contain any acceptance provisions  and iv services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
in these cases  we recognize license revenue utilizing the residual method  as prescribed in sop no 
 as amended by sop no 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie maintenance  professional services and hosting  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie software license 
under the residual method  we defer the fair value of undelivered elements and the remainder of the arrangement fee is then allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue assuming the other revenue recognition criteria are met 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each undelivered element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the items for which evidence of fair value cannot be established are delivered 
if the only undelivered element is maintenance or hosting  then the entire amount of revenue is recognized over the delivery period 
vendor specific objective evidence is established for most maintenance and hosting of our products based upon the amounts we charge when maintenance and hosting are sold separately 
vendor specific objective evidence for maintenance in arrangements where license value is greater than one million dollars  we utilize the contractual stated renewal rate  provided that the stated renewal rate is considered substantive 

table of contents partner arrangements 
distributors  resellers and systems integrators purchase products for specific projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration and post sales service and support 
the agreements with these partners have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our software to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
revenue on shipments to our partners is generally recognized on delivery or sell through and after the end user has been identified 
contract accounting method 
where the services are essential to the functionality of the software element of the arrangement and separate accounting for the services is not permitted  contract accounting is applied to both the software and service elements 
for these projects  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
typically  a percentage of completion basis is evidenced by labor hours incurred compared to estimated total labor hours to complete the project 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale includes software and software related products  on demand subscriptions  services  or a combination of these items 
we utilize the cost basis alternative to allocate revenue under sop no 
we have the ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs 
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which it is first determined that a loss is apparent 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognized in accordance with sop no 
is allocated for classification purposes in the statement of operations between license and service revenues based on an estimate of the fair value of the service portion of the arrangement as indicated by rates that we separately sell similar services and use of the residual method for the license component 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
professional services from time and materials contracts and training services  along with the related costs are recognized as these services are performed 
maintenance and hosting revenue these arrangements are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
based on the criteria outlined in eitf no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware we have determined that the vast majority of our hosting arrangements are within the scope of sop no 
the applicability of eitf no 
allows us to recognize that portion of the fee attributable to the license on delivery  while that portion of the fee related to the hosting element recognized ratably as the service is provided  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria of sop no 
have been met 
in cases where the hosting arrangement falls outside of the scope of sop no 
 we recognize the arrangement ratably under the provisions of sab no 
 revenue recognition 
on demand subscriptions in hosted arrangements where we provide our software applications as a service  we considered eitf no 
and concluded that generally these transactions are considered service arrangements and fall outside of the scope of sop no 
accordingly  we follow the provisions of sab no 
and eitf no 
customers will typically prepay for these services  amounts which we will defer and recognize ratably over the non cancelable term of the customer contract 
in addition to the hosting services  these arrangements may also include set up fees which are sold on a set fee and or customization which are billed on a time and materials basis 
we recognize the revenue from these services ratably over the remaining non cancelable term of the subscription contract once the implementation is complete and the customer has access to the software 
in addition  we defer the direct costs of the implementation and configuration services and amortize those costs over the same time period as the related revenue is recognized 
if the direct costs incurred for a contract exceed the non cancelable contract value  then we will recognize a loss for incurred and projected direct costs in excess of the contract value as a period expense 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
because of this assessment  which covers the sales of all our products 
table of contents and services  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential future estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make all of their required payments 
in making this estimate  we analyze historical payment performance  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers or any of the other factors we use to analyze credit worthiness were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  a reserve for future sales returns is also established based on historical trends in product return rates and is recorded as a reduction to our revenue and accounts receivable 
if the future actual returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
commissions commissions are generally expensed as they become payable 
our resultsondemand commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of our related subscription contracts with our customers  which are typically to months 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  but is instead tested for impairment at least annually  typically during the fourth quarter  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value for the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test  we consider ourself to be one reporting unit 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values using straight line and accelerated methods designed to match the amortization to the benefits received where applicable 
purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
restructuring charges restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
refer to note  restructuring  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce all of the deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized by us 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  net in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase reported income or reduce loss in the applicable period and increase stockholders equity on the balance sheet in the period such determination was made 
to the extent that such realizable deferred tax assets related to the results of the acquired company prior to the acquisition  there would be a reduction to goodwill 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the acquisitions discussed in note  acquisitions and intangible assets  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and include the results of operations of the acquired businesses since the date of acquisition 
net assets of the companies acquired were recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition

r share based payment  which established standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions

r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period

amortization of intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in the twelve months ended december  over the comparable period of is primarily due to a million decrease in the amortization of certain docent intangible assets which became fully amortized in and a million decrease in the amortization of pathlore intangibles in line with cash flow projections of the business made at the acquisition  offsetting a million increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the mindsolve acquisition reflecting a full year of amortization in gross margin the following table is the summary of gross margin between license and amortization of intangible assets  and service and maintenance in thousands  except percentages year ended december  gross margin subscriptions and support percentage of subscriptions and support revenue services percentage of services revenue license percentage of license revenue amortization of intangible assets percentage of license revenue total gross margin percentage of net revenue gross margin percent for subscriptions and support in the year ended december  decreased over the comparable period in due to the lower overall margin percent of our totalperformance product acquired in november  together with investments in staff and support costs made to expand that business and additional depreciation expense as we invested in our hosting infrastructure

we expect a small increase in general and administrative expenses for restructuring charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of  in employee severance costs 
employee severance consists of severance and other benefits resulting from a reduction in force across all company functions of employees 
the restructuring charge in was due to a restructuring accrual adjustment as result of a final lease termination agreement for our chicago facility in the third quarter of in process research and development

although we may need to return to the capital markets  establish new credit facilities  or raise capital in private transactions in order to meet our capital requirements  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to access these potential sources of funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all

table of contents interest rate risk 
we hold our assets primarily in cash and cash equivalents  such as short term marketable debt securities  money market funds and other cash equivalents and short term investments such as commercial paper  publicly traded common stock and treasury notes 
we minimize risk by investing in financial instruments with original maturities of less than one year

we have foreign currency risk as a result of sales by our foreign subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the years ended december    and  these sales amounted to  and  respectively 
all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the us are charged to the foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the us we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated in us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  certain transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we began entering into day forward contracts for usd and gbp to hedge anticipated cash flows from our uk subsidiary 
on december   we entered into a forward contract in which we sold approximately million gbp  equivalent million usd  for a value date of january   for which a hypothetical appreciation of the gbp to usd would result in a million gain and a hypothetical depreciation of gbp to usd would result in a million loss 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was cumulative net gains losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results
