item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for an explanation of forward looking statements 
risks related to our business we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although we believe we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates or continual flattening or inversion of the yield curve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to lending risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate 
increases in interest rates  minimum required payments  energy prices and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of the collateral securing loans  or demand for our loan products 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate and consumer loans  which made up the remaining of our loan portfolio 
because the portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
this reserve represents our best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in our judgment is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks 
table of contents inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of various factors  including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of regulatory examinations  and current economic conditions 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on local and national economic conditions and trends 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in southern indiana  southern and central illinois  as well as in the chicago area  western  central and northern kentucky and southwest ohio 
we have commercial real estate loan production offices located in cleveland  cincinnati  and columbus  ohio  as well as louisville  kentucky  and we have a commercial banking team in the cincinnati  ohio area 
in february   we opened a commercial real estate loan production office in nashville  tennessee 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current credit cycle could adversely affect our credit quality results and reported earnings during  the banking industry began increasing loan loss reserves which was a clear indication of a turn in the credit cycle 
credit weakness began in the residential housing industry and has produced dramatic declines in housing starts  near record levels of home inventory  lower home prices and the higher mortgage delinquency rates 
during the housing expansion a number of new mortgage products were introduced that have never been tested in a cyclical downturn 
this has impacted both lenders who originate these new products  which include subprime  alt a  or option arms  as well as financial institutions who offer residential mortgages  home equity or residential housing construction loan products 
subprime  alt a and option arms are products which we do not and have not originated 
other negative factors include consumer debt being at all time high levels  a slowing of retail sales  higher levels of initial unemployment claims  slowing income growth  and corporate profits that are under pressure 
we cannot assure you that the current economic slowdown will not lead to broader credit problems than the residential housing sector 
in the fourth quarter of  this downturn affected us  as we experienced an increase in non performing assets due primarily to our residential home builder business  located primarily  but not entirely  in the chicago area 
the performance of our residential mortgage loan portfolio continues to be acceptable 
due to the increase in non performing loans and economic downturn  we increased our allowance for loan losses and related provision 
we expect that the current downturn will continue throughout if so  it could adversely affect us by resulting in a higher level of nonperforming assets  a higher provision for loan losses and higher levels of charge offs 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types 
table of contents of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
additionally  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
some of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
local or privately held community banking organizations in certain markets may price or structure their products in such a way that it makes it difficult for us to compete in those markets in a way that allows us to meet our profitability or credit goals 
any competitor may choose to offer pricing on loans and deposits that we think is irrational and choose to not compete with 
competitors may also be willing to extend credit without obtaining covenants or collateral and by offering weaker loan structures than we are willing to accept 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services  our reputation with consumers who reside in the markets we serve  the rate at which we introduce new products and services  customer satisfaction  and industry and general economic trends 
if we fail to perform in any of these areas  our competitive position and ability to grow would be weakened  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and face legal risks 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect several areas  including our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  and requirements to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to our customers 
congress and federal agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation of statutes  regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
additionally  the number of regulations we must comply with and the financial resources required to comply with those regulations has continually increased 
the cost of complying with these regulations makes it more difficult to remain competitive 
additionally  we are continually subject to various legal risks 
we may be perceived by some to have deep pockets and could be subject to various forms of actual or threatened litigation 
we utilize in house and external counsel to help us proactively manage those risks 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system 
table of contents are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in fraud  operational or other losses that adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fraud risks could include fraud by employees  vendors  customers or anyone we or our customers do business or come in contact with 
the parent company relies on dividends from integra bank for most of its revenue 
our parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from integra bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the parent company 
also  a holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event integra bank is unable to pay dividends to the parent company  the parent company may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from integra bank could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
we seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar  have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  changes in the national economy or in the markets in which we do business could reduce the anticipated benefits resulting from an acquisition  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company 
we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  if we fail to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our local markets  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

table of contents our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems  including risks to data integrity 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations

overview during  we focused our efforts on our long term goals of increasing franchise value  while generating an acceptable level of earnings growth 
these efforts were complicated by the turn in the credit cycle in the second half of the year that surfaced with consumer real estate and construction homebuilder portfolios and resulted in higher levels of non performing loans and net charge offs across the industry 
these developments had a negative impact on earnings of banking companies in general and raised concerns that the ongoing problems in the housing market could push the economy into recession  resulting in lower stock prices 
the key components of our strategic plan are to maintain sound credit through an uncertain economic environment  add new customers and do more with them  increase our presence in faster growing metro markets by recruiting successful and experienced lending and product teams and executing selective acquisitions  improve our margin and net interest income by continuing to improve our earning asset mix by growing commercial loans  while allowing our residential mortgage and indirect marine and recreational vehicle loans to amortize  coupled with growing lower cost deposits  improve operating leverage which is the difference between percentage growth in total revenue less percentage growth in non interest expense by reducing expenses in lower growth and lower profitability lines of business and by investing in higher growth and higher return lines of business  and allocate capital to the most profitable uses to increase total shareholder returns  and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases 
in  we met or exceeded the goals in the areas of adding new customers  increasing our presence in faster growing metro markets  improving our net interest income and asset mix  and capital allocation 
we did not improve our operating leverage on a year over year basis  as expenses grew faster than revenues 
this was due primarily to investments we made in key personnel throughout the year  coupled with the integration of the former prairie financial corporation  or prairie  which we acquired in april prairie was a year old community bank with five offices in the chicago metropolitan region 
our earnings were driven by the addition of both consumer and commercial customers  which led to strong commercial loan growth and good consumer loan growth  as well as continued growth of service charge  debit card  atm fee and annuity income 

table of contents our asset mix continued to improve  with higher yielding commercial loans making up about of average total earning assets  compared to in and in the positive loan growth in commercial banking was driven primarily by commercial real estate and the commercial lending group located in our cincinnati market  coupled with the effects of the prairie acquisition 
the growth in and profitability of our cincinnati commercial group contributed positively to our financial results and was in line with our expectations 
our growth in commercial real estate continued and was accompanied by excellent credit results  helping us maintain a stable net interest margin 
the success of our high performance checking initiative continued  resulting in more customers  higher levels of deposit service charge and debit card interchange income  and increased usage of our electronic bill pay and other online banking services 
net charge offs were our lowest since  totaling basis points 
non performing assets increased  from december  the increase was totally due to dislocations occurring in the chicago residential housing markets that affected our chicago commercial real estate portfolio 
the credit quality in our other lines of business remains stable 
net income for the year was  an increase of  or from comparisons between and were affected by a significant event in each year 
financial results for were impacted by the prairie acquisition in the second quarter 
financial results for were impacted by a fourth quarter charge off and related provision for loan losses of  additional highlights for were as follows diluted earnings per share for increased by from in  return on assets increased to from  return on equity increased to from  efficiency ratio was compared to  net interest margin was  an increase of basis points  the provision for loan losses was  service charge income grew by  or  with of this growth coming from our chicago market  debit card fee income increased by  or  and non interest expense increased by  or  including  of direct costs and merger related expenses resulting from the prairie acquisition  as well as of expenses from our planned acquisition of peoples community bancorp  inc  or peoples  which was terminated on january  in summary  we believe that our results for indicate solid progress on the goals of our three year plan 
our capital ratios all remain strong and are both within the regulatory requirements for being well capitalized  as well as within our internal policy guidelines 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and 
table of contents reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the section labeled credit management below provides additional information on this subject 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  we use assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience and the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  trading securities  mortgage servicing rights  other real estate owned  as well as fair values associated with derivative financial instruments and goodwill and other intangibles 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale and trading securities are based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the fair values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted market values 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we assess goodwill for impairment no less than annually by applying a series of fair value based tests using the net present value of estimated net cash flows  the average stock price of our stock for the past twelve months and our stock s expected target price over the next twelve months 
impairment exists when the net book value of our one reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
core deposit intangibles are recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash model valuation at the time of acquisition and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
customer relationship intangibles utilize a method that discounts the cash flows related to future loan relationships that are expected to result from referrals from existing customers 
estimated cash flows are determined based on estimated future net interest income resulting from these relationships  less a provision for loan losses  non interest expense  income taxes and contributory asset charges 
mortgage servicing rights  or msrs  represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income  net of estimated costs  we expect to receive on loans sold with servicing retained 
we sold our mortgage servicing rights portfolio during the first quarter of and no longer retain msrs on new loan originations 
prior to the sale  msrs were capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained 
the carrying value of msrs was amortized in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income 
this amortization was recorded as a reduction to income 
the carrying value of msrs  prior to  was periodically reviewed for impairment based on fair value 
we disaggregated our servicing rights portfolio based on loan type and interest rate  which were the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
a primary factor influencing the fair value was the estimated life of the 
table of contents underlying loans serviced 
the estimated life of the loans serviced was significantly influenced by market interest rates 
during a period of declining interest rates  the fair value of the msrs should decline due to an expected increase in prepayments within the portfolio 
alternatively  during a period of rising interest rates the fair value of msrs should increase as prepayments on the underlying loans would be expected to decline 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized

table of contents net interest income net interest income in the following tables is presented on a tax equivalent basis and is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense paid on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings

tax exempt income  such as interest on loans and securities of state and political subdivisions  has been increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
net interest income for was  or higher than the increase was primarily due to an improved asset mix and higher volumes resulting from both organic growth and the prairie acquisition 
higher yielding commercial loans were of earning assets in  compared to in the average yield on these assets was for  compared to the overall yield on earning assets of for earning asset yields increased basis points in  compared to a basis point increase in interest bearing liabilities 
major contributors to the change in net interest income from to are as follows average earning assets increased  or 
loans from the new chicago region contributed  to the average  including average balances of  of higher yielding commercial loans 
increases in the average balances of commercial loans of  more than offset planned declines in residential mortgage loans of  indirect consumer loans of  and securities of  this change in the composition of earning assets was in line with our ongoing strategy of improving our mix of earning assets by reducing lower yielding securities  residential mortgage loan and indirect consumer loan balances and increasing the amount of higher yielding commercial loans 
the increase in average commercial loan balances for was driven by increases in commercial real estate loans of  and also from loans originated by our commercial lending group located in cincinnati  ohio 
average balances for this group increased  the average rate of commercial loans increased basis points  as yields continued to reflect consistent increases for most of the year in market interest rates  which resulted in changes to our pricing for new loans and upward interest rate adjustments on existing variable rate products 
this trend reversed during the fourth quarter for variable rate loans tied to prime rate indexes  as well as for new originations 

table of contents non interest bearing deposit average balances increased  while the average balances of savings and interest bearing demand deposits  which have an average cost of basis points  increased  the average balance of non interest bearing deposits for the chicago region was  while the average for savings and interest bearing demand was  the increase in the average balance of earning assets was funded primarily by increases in time deposits of  and money market accounts of  these funding sources carried an average rate of and in  compared to and in the pricing of retail certificates acquired in the prairie transaction were higher than those in our other markets 
during the second through fourth quarters  the balances of those retail certificates declined  as we were able to secure deposits at lower costs in other regions 
net interest income for was  or lower than the decrease was primarily due to the effects of a flattening yield curve during that became inverted during  increasing funding costs more quickly than the increase in asset yields 
those effects were offset by an improved earning asset mix  particularly within total loans 
the inversion of the yield curve had a negative effect on us because more of our liabilities matured or repriced in the short term than the assets some of those liabilities were funding 
major contributors to the change in net interest income from to are as follows average earning assets decreased  or  driven by decreases in average securities balances of  and residential mortgage loans of  these decreases were largely offset by increases in average commercial loan balances of  and direct consumer loans of  this change in the composition of earning assets was in line with our strategy of improving our mix of earning assets by reducing lower yielding securities  residential mortgage loan and indirect consumer loan balances and increasing the amount of higher yielding commercial loans 
the increase in average commercial loan balances for was driven by increases in commercial real estate loans of  and also from the commercial lending team added during the second and third quarters in the cincinnati  ohio area 
this group ended the year with outstanding balances of  the average rate of commercial loans increased basis points  as loans repriced throughout to higher rates brought about by market rate increases and new originations were priced at higher rates than during non interest bearing deposit average balances increased  while the average balances of savings and interest bearing demand deposits  which have an average cost of basis points  declined  the reduction in core deposits was largely offset by increases in the average balances of money market accounts  which had an average cost of  of  the shift from low and very low cost deposits to higher yielding money market accounts occurred throughout the first three quarters of for us and throughout the banking industry  as consumers sought higher rate investment alternatives and deposit products 
during the fourth quarter of  this migration abated 
a shift in funding sources occurred in the average balance of brokered certificates of deposit increased  while long term borrowing average balances declined  helping result in a lower overall balance of interest bearing liabilities of  this shift took place during in part due to refinancing of  of fixed term debt that carried a weighted average rate of  that matured in march this refinancing extended maturities over a one to three year period 
it also helped us improve our overall liquidity position and demonstrated a lower level of reliance on fhlb funding

other professional fees declined due to lower expenses in the area of branch mystery shopping and facilities design 
the reduction in salaries expense was a result of a further reduction to our workforce  from average ftes during to average ftes in continued ongoing initiatives to find and execute efficiencies were successful  allowing us to reallocate resources to higher yielding businesses  such as the commercial lending team added during the second and third quarters of at december   we had ftes compared to in and in incentives declined from largely due to a reduction in executive incentive compensation expense that resulted because of the fourth quarter loan charge off 
processing expense declined from largely due to successful execution of expense reduction initiatives that resulted in new contracts and lower costs  particularly in the area of atm and debit card transaction processing 
franchise  sales  state and local tax expense declined because of the filing of a franchise tax refund claim for a prior year  a sales tax liability paid in that did not reoccur in and resulted from a audit  and lower franchise tax liabilities  as well as lower state and local deposit taxes 
the increase in medical expense was primarily the result of two items

the increase in low income housing partnership investment expenses was due to higher than expected operating losses from the partnerships we have investments in

in the third quarter  we conducted a comprehensive review of our securities available for sale portfolio 
the review was the result of the changing economic landscape from recent events surrounding the mortgage industry  recent statements and actions by the federal open market committee in particular  the decision to lower the fed funds target rate in mid september  and our desire to reposition the securities portfolio liquidity  interest rate risk  and earnings over the long term 
the sale of these securities and purchase of  of new securities helped ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stayed within policy requirements of our capital markets risk policy which considers our ability to fund our liabilities  the duration of our loan portfolio and the model or target duration of our asset mix

table of contents prairie acquisition 
commercial loans in our new chicago region totaled  at december  the commercial real estate line of business has loan production offices  or lpos  in metro cincinnati  cleveland  and columbus  ohio  and louisville  kentucky 
the lpo in columbus  ohio was opened in the second half of outstanding balances for loans managed by this group totaled  at december  compared to  at december  the majority of these loans were made within the areas the lpos serve 
these loans were used to finance a variety of construction and development projects that included apartments  residential land developments  condominiums  retail centers  office buildings  as well as some hospitality and industrial type properties 
loans are occasionally made on projects outside the markets served by the lpos to borrowers who are either located within our market area or who have previous lending relationships with our commercial real estate lenders 
competition for these credits typically comes from larger national and regional commercial banks 
since the inception of this line of business  this portfolio has not experienced any charge offs  while generating returns in excess of those originally forecasted when the strategy was launched 
our commercial real estate portfolio is concentrated within four different areas 
the two largest concentrations are in multi family at  or of the total portfolio  the majority of which represents for sale projects in the chicago area  as well as retail  which are  also of the total 
the retail portfolio includes direct loans or participations in larger loans primarily for stand alone retail buildings for large national or regional retailers  and for regional shopping centers with national and regional tenants  as well as strong guarantors

we generally lend for projects located in our markets 
of our total real estate exposure  is located in our four state footprint of indiana  illinois  kentucky and ohio 
no other state represents more than of total commitments 
commercial  industrial and agricultural loans increased  or from year end the net increase was due in part to an increase in the outstanding balance of loans originated by the cincinnati  ohio based commercial lending team which began operations in the second half of total commercial and industrial loans for this group totaled  at december   compared to  at december  the remainder of the increase came from loans to customers located in our community markets 
the acquisition of prairie did not have an impact on this portfolio  as their commercial portfolio was largely concentrated in commercial real estate 
residential mortgage loans decreased  or from year end  reflecting a change in strategy for mortgage processing  underwriting  closing and servicing functions executed during the first quarter of under this strategy  we continue to originate residential mortgage loans  but then sell substantially all of these loans to a private label provider on a servicing released basis 
the cash flows obtained from the paydowns and payoffs of existing mortgage loans  as well as those from indirect consumer loans and securities  are used to originate higher yielding commercial loans and thus improve our mix of earning assets 
the execution of this new strategy has also lowered our exposure to declining home prices and potential credit losses 
we expect the reduction in residential mortgage loans to continue to decline during the prairie acquisition did not significantly impact residential mortgage loan balances

nonaccrual loans are loans on which we have suspended recognizing interest because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest according to the terms of the contract 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question or when we determine the loan is impaired 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
loans days or more past due  which totaled  at december   are loans that are continuing to accrue interest  but which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
we are not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which we reasonably believe will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which we have serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms

the increase in non performing loans and other real estate owned is primarily due to the housing downturn that began in while we do not underwrite a subprime product  and the performance of our residential mortgage portfolio continues to be acceptable  we did experience an increase in non performing assets due primarily to our residential builder business  located primarily  although not entirely  in the chicago area

we maintain a watch list of commercial loans and review those loans quarterly 
for the most part  assets are designated as watch list loans to ensure more frequent monitoring 
the assets are reviewed to ensure proper earning status and management strategy 
if it is determined that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with the original terms of the contract then the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
we also review nonaccrual loans on an ongoing basis 
credit management our credit management procedures include board oversight of the lending function by the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets at least quarterly 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  non performing loans and assets  problem and watch list loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  a sample of loans is reviewed by an independent loan review department or outside independent third party  as well as by a compliance department and regulatory agencies 
consumer  mortgage and small business loans are centrally underwritten and approved while commercial loans are approved through a combination of low individual lending authorities  independent senior credit officers and a corporate credit committee 
a limited number of officers have the authority  in certain cases and for certain loan types  to override centrally denied loan requests 
those overrides must meet certain conditions and are centrally tracked and monitored for performance 
the corporate credit committee approves all relationships of  or more 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable inherent loan losses as determined by our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  industry concentrations  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to operations to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
an annual review of selected loans  based on size  is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the relationship manager responsible for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented by the loan review area  which provides information assisting in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to us 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in our geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any forecasting methodology 
at december   the unallocated reserve included within the allowance for loan losses was as compared to  at december  the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by our periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
we have developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents our process to perform this analysis includes expanded data analysis  back testing and ongoing refinements to documentation surrounding the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance provides reliable measures of the probability of default and risk of loss for our categories of loans with similar risk characteristics and analyzes loss data over the period of time that we believe is appropriate 
this improves the measure of inherent loss over a complete economic cycle and reduces the impact for qualitative adjustments 
this process does not impact losses estimated in accordance with sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we continue to enhance our risk management capabilities 
in  we implemented the markov migration model for our commercial portfolio 
among the most significant enhancements were expanded score band performance  loan to value analysis  and vintage analysis 
initiatives implemented in and included the use of custom scorecards to forecast defaults as well as losses within our consumer portfolio  creation of a default model based off of historical data to help determine credit costs  and creation of a foundation for risk based capital allocation using the markov model 
these enhancements have and will continue to help in refining our capital allocation for estimated loan losses 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  a decrease of  from the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was at both december  and the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans at december  was compared to at december  the decreased provision in was primarily due to the impact to from the charge off of a  lending relationship  which is described further below  lower commercial net charge offs  excluding the above relationship  of  our commercial real estate and cincinnati commercial lines of business have experienced no charge offs since the inception of those businesses 
despite the decline in the percentage of the allowance to total non performing loans  we believe that our reserve is adequate 
some of those reasons are as follows the chicago area builder loans that accounted for the increase to non performing loans are adequately secured and should not result in significant charge offs  the risk in our non performing loans is granular  with only eight non performing loans exceeding and only one exceeding  the performance of our other portfolios remains strong and our level of net charge offs was low to moderate at basis points for  including basis points for the fourth quarter of  and we are not seeing a material impact on our loan losses related to our residential mortgage portfolio  since we do not underwrite a subprime mortgage portfolio 
the increased provision in was primarily due to the impact of the charge off of the  lending relationship during the fourth quarter of  which is described further below  greater charge offs in our consumer portfolio  particularly in the areas of indirect marine and recreational vehicle loans  which had net charge offs of  compared to in  and net recoveries in of for commercial mortgage and commercial construction and development real estate credits  as opposed to net charge offs of for we charged off a  lending relationship in the fourth quarter of  and instituted legal action against our borrower 
since then  eleven other collection suits have been filed against the borrower  including six by other financial institutions 
as the result of an investigation by the state of florida  a state court in florida appointed a receiver to take over the operations of the borrower 
during  the receiver found that the borrower owed funds to individuals that purchased an employee investment savings account  as well as others involved in a stock program 
this is in addition to the claims that have been made by the various financial institutions 
on march   integra along with three other financial institutions filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the borrower 
the bankruptcy petition was subsequently certified by the court  a trust appointed  and a creditors committee formed 
claims filed against this borrower total almost  of which ours comprises approximately 
table of contents the relationship with this borrower began in as a part of a strategy to originate out of market credits through a broker network 
there are no other significant loans remaining in our portfolio from that strategy 
we continue to actively pursue our rights and remedies to collect the outstanding balance of these loans  as well as accrued interest and legal and other fees 
net charge offs to average loans for decreased to basis points compared to basis points in the  charge off recorded during the fourth quarter of represented basis points of the basis points of net charge offs in net losses from our commercial portfolio were basis points for  while losses from our residential and consumer portfolios were and basis points

any modifications could adversely affect our profitability and capital levels over the near term  but would be undertaken if we believe that restructuring the balance sheet will improve our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile on a longer term basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
our long term borrowings represent fhlb advances with various terms and rates collateralized primarily by first mortgage loans and certain specifically assigned securities  securities sold under repurchase agreements  notes payable secured by equipment  subordinated debt and trust preferred securities 
we are also committed under various operating leases for premises and equipment 
in the normal course of our business  there are various outstanding commitments and contingencies  including letters of credit and standby letters of credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to credit loss in the event the nonperformance by the other party to the commitment is limited to the contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for other on balance sheet instruments

we opened a new banking center in union  kentucky in and none in at december   we had no future contractual commitments related to construction of new banking centers 
we and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december  and  we and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier capital for the parent holding company under federal reserve guidelines 
as a result of the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
 the federal reserve adopted a rule that allows the limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier capital  subject to stricter qualitative limits 
liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings and to protect us against interest rate volatility 
we continuously monitor our current and prospective business activity in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
the primary sources of short term asset liquidity for integra bank include federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions and securities available for sale 
short term asset liquidity is also provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans and securities 
we monitor the balance between these sources and the need to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals under our capital markets policy 
when these sources are not adequate  we may use federal fund purchases  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  sales of investment securities or our borrowing capacity with the fhlb

federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that national banks can make to their holding companies without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including the amount of its net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and net profits for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration 
liquidity for the parent holding company is required to support its operational expenses  pay taxes  meet outstanding debt and trust preferred securities obligations  provide dividends to shareholders  fund stock repurchases and other general corporate purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
our interest rate risk management program is comprised of several components  including board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
we strive to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and capital through our interest rate risk management processes 
we manage interest rate risk with oversight by the alco and finance committee of the board of directors  or board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
a committee comprised of senior officers  the corporate alco committee  meets at least quarterly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
we measure and monitor interest rate risk by utilizing a simulation model 
we use the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
we consider ear to be our best measure for managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
these interest rate scenarios are executed against a balance sheet utilizing projected growth and composition 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolio 
this simulation model projects the net interest income forecasted under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   we would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a negative change in net interest income 
both simulation results are well within the policy limits established by the board alco 
the increase in ear in the scenario from to is mostly due to an increase year over year of our commercial loan balances and our continued reduction in mortgage related products 
trends in earnings at risk estimated change in ear from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  economic value of equity eve 
we consider eve to be our best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities under each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
for eve calculations  future balance sheet composition is not a factor 

table of contents the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points within a range of plus or minus 
at december   we would experience a negative change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a negative change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
the slight year to year improvement in eve at risk is due to the reduction in mortgage loans and mortgage related securities  reducing mortgage prepayment risk 
trends in economic value of equity estimated change in eve from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
