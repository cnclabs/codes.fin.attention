table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors you should read the following discussion together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k 
the discussions under the subheadings review of operating segments below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
company management considers local currency growth an important measure because by excluding the volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume change is clearer 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are based on current company expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially 
all statements regarding future performance  earnings projections  earnings guidance  management s expectations about its future cash needs and effective tax rate  and other future events or developments are forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties included  but are not limited to  those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors in this form k 
the company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure and undertakes no obligation to update them 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on company management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding the company s accounting policies 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and appropriate segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which a final determination is made 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of the future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while company management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired 

table of contents goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests at least annually  including whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  the company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal years  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled 
transfer of title and risk of loss occurs when the product is delivered in accordance with the contractual shipping terms 
in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when either i the company has previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria for contracts with acceptance provisions based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer for contracts with acceptance provisions where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria 
revenue for contracts which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts company management evaluates its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  company management records in earnings an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the company s expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when company management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
company management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether company management intends to retain the investment for a period of time that is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
defined benefit retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined ie  defined benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 

table of contents pension expense associated with the company s defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  projected pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately  the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the us plans as of july  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the discount rate assumption for non us plans reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of benefit payments for each of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies company management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed  including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insured employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for the fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates increased reported sales by  primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro  the british pound  the yen and various other asian currencies 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year  sales increased 
increased pricing achieved in both the life sciences and industrial segments contributed to overall sales growth in the year and  as such  the overall volume increase was 
life sciences segment sales increased in local currency  attributable to growth in the biopharmaceuticals market  partly offset by a slight decrease in the medical market 
industrial segment sales increased in local currency driven by growth in the energy  water process technologies market formerly general industrial and aerospace transportation markets  partially offset by decreased sales in the microelectronics market 
overall systems sales increased  representing of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  primarily attributable to strong sales in the biopharmaceuticals  energy  water process technologies and aerospace transportation markets 
company management expects overall sales in local currency to increase in the range of in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  with growth rates in both life sciences and industrial falling within that range 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to the section review of operating segments below 

table of contents gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal year on par with fiscal year improved pricing in both segments contributed approximately basis points in margin 
gross margin has been favorably impacted by a change in market mix within consumables in the life sciences segment  improved profitability on certain systems sales in the industrial segment and savings generated from the company s facilities rationalization initiative and other manufacturing cost reduction and efficiency programs  including lean initiatives to improve labor productivity  that dampened estimated inflationary pressures on manufacturing costs 
these factors were offset by the impact of a shift in product mix  to a higher percentage of systems sales about compared to in fiscal year  which are typically at lower margins than consumables  mix change within consumables to lower margin products in industrial  and incremental costs related to the facilities rationalization initiative 
the company continued to make progress on its facilities rationalization initiative and in fiscal year completed the closure of a plant in waldstetten  germany 
for a detailed discussion of gross margin by segment  refer to the section review of operating segments below 
company management is targeting gross margin to be about in fiscal year  as expected pricing increases and surcharges as well as continued efficiencies from the company s cost reduction initiatives are expected to more than offset inflationary pressures on operating costs

as a percentage of sales  ebit was compared to in fiscal year net interest expense in fiscal year decreased to  from  in fiscal year the decline in net interest expense was principally attributable to a decrease in the amount of interest expense recorded due to a payment of  to the irs related to the tax matter for discussion of tax matter see note  audit committee inquiry and restatement  to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k partly offset by increased interest expense primarily related to higher debt levels in the us compared to the same period last year 
in fiscal year  the company s effective tax rate was as compared to in fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to charges taken in fiscal year for the net tax cost of the anticipated repatriation of approximately  of foreign earnings and additional taxes provided on intercompany transactions net of an increase related to the mix of foreign earnings 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year includes charges resulting from new tax legislation in certain foreign jurisdictions and an incremental tax expense of  related to cash repatriated in fiscal year under the plan discussed above 
in fiscal year  company management expects its effective tax rate to start to improve compared to fiscal year see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details on the components of the company s effective tax rate 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per share  compared with net earnings of  or per share in fiscal year in summary  net earnings reflect the growth in ebit  a decrease in net interest expense and a decrease in the effective tax rate 
company management estimates that foreign currency translation increased net earnings by approximately cents per share in the year 
in fiscal year  company management expects earnings per share to be in the range of 
this range contemplates an expectation that the acquisition of genesystems will be dilutive to earnings by cents but does not include items that would be classified as restructuring and other charges  including any in process research and development charge that the company may record related to the genesystems acquisition

increases in the biosciences and hospital markets of and  respectively  partly mitigated this impact 
the decrease in the blood filtration market primarily relates to decreased volume to several major customers as they have transitioned to alternate suppliers at the natural end of their contractual commitments or as a result of a new tender process 
this has been partially offset with a price increase 
the increase in the biosciences market was primarily driven by growth in original equipment manufacturer oem sales contributed by europe and asia and growth in laboratory sales contributed by all geographies  with europe the strongest 
the increase in oem sales was largely attributable to drug delivery products in france  as well as new business in scandinavia 
key growth drivers in the laboratory market were new product initiatives in life sciences research and laboratory water 
the growth in hospital sales was primarily driven by increased aquasafe and breathing filter sales in the western hemisphere and asia  specifically in japan 
company management expects overall medical sales to increase in the low single digit range in fiscal year compared to fiscal year biopharmaceuticals sales increased  as systems sales increased about compared to fiscal year  and consumables sales grew 
by geography  growth was led by europe  the company s largest geographic biopharmaceuticals market  accompanied by increases in the western hemisphere and asia 
the growth in systems sales primarily reflects investment by the biotechnology sector in the western hemisphere and europe as the company s total fluid management sm strategy presents many opportunities for growth in the biopharmaceuticals market 
the growth in consumables sales was attributable to growth in europe and asia of approximately and  respectively  partly offset by a decrease of about in the western hemisphere caused by sales downturns and inventory reduction programs in certain large us biotechnology customers 
overall  key products driving growth are the company s virus removal filters for biotechnology and plasma derived therapeutics  its increasing portfolio of single use processing technologies including the kleenpak connector  and its chromatography portfolio for both systems and consumables 
company management continued to see strong investment in systems and new manufacturing facilities globally 
continuing customer investment in new manufacturing capacity is providing future growth opportunities in consumable sales as these new plants progressively come on stream 
for fiscal year  company management expects double digit sales growth in the biopharmaceuticals market compared to fiscal year life sciences gross margins increased basis points to from in fiscal year the improvement in gross margins was principally driven by improved pricing that contributed approximately basis points in margin  a change in market mix within consumables of total life sciences consumable sales were in the higher margin biopharmaceuticals market compared to in fiscal year  an improvement in systems margins and savings generated from cost reduction initiatives which dampened estimated inflationary pressures on manufacturing and related overhead costs

sales in the industrial manufacturing market increased generated by growth in all geographies  with the most significant growth achieved in asia 
demand in the metal and mining sectors were key growth drivers 
aerospace transportation sales increased with all markets contributing to this gain 
the growth in military sales was primarily driven by strong growth in asia  where sales increased primarily related to a large water systems project with the australian military 
the growth in military sales in the year also reflects ch helicopter upgrade projects in the western hemisphere 
the growth in the commercial portion of this market primarily reflects strong after market sales and increased oem sales generated by an increase in airframe build rates 
the increase in the transportation market was driven by demand in the construction and mining equipment sectors 
microelectronics sales decreased slightly as a decline in the western hemisphere was partly offset by low single digit growth in europe as well as in asia  the company s largest geographic microelectronics market 
overall  the sales decrease in the year reflects tough comparables against the strong growth achieved in fiscal year and the current cyclical downturn in the semiconductor market  which impacted oem sales 
these factors were partly mitigated by sales growth in the thin film rigid disc  inkjet  solar cell and home server markets 
industrial gross margins decreased basis points to from in fiscal year the decrease in gross margins reflects the impact of a shift in product mix systems sales were of total industrial sales compared to in fiscal year and market mix within consumables  and incremental costs in europe related to the facilities rationalization initiative 
these negative impacts were partially offset by improved profitability of certain systems sales some of which is related to standardization of systems and product portfolio rationalization  improved pricing that contributed about basis points in margin and the impact of the company s manufacturing cost reduction programs  which dampened the estimated inflation of manufacturing costs 
sg a expenses increased by  or about approximately in local currency compared to fiscal year the increase in sg a reflects an increase in selling related costs

life sciences segment sales increased in local currency attributable to growth in both the biopharmaceuticals and medical markets 
industrial segment sales increased in local currency with all markets contributing to the growth 
overall systems sales increased  representing of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  primarily attributable to strong sales in the energy  water process technologies market 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin reflects an overall increase in pricing of about  driven by both segments which contributed approximately basis points to gross margin  and savings generated from the company s facilities rationalization initiatives 
in fiscal year  the company completed the outsourcing and closure of plants in hamburg and rostock  germany and a plant in ternay  france and also announced the closure of a plant in waldstetten  germany 
additionally  gross margin has been favorably impacted by the company s many manufacturing continuous improvement initiatives  including lean initiatives to improve labor productivity and  therefore  reduce labor cost  and cost reduction initiatives focused on procurement improvements to reduce direct material and freight costs and movement of certain activities to lower cost countries to also reduce labor costs 
in addition  initiatives to improve the profitability of systems sales included product rationalization of less profitable systems 
these factors are partly offset by the impact of the significant growth in systems sales  which typically have lower margins than consumables  and incremental costs related to the facilities rationalization initiative that include incremental depreciation on assets to be retired earlier than originally estimated and training 
sg a expenses in fiscal year increased by  or about approximately in local currency

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
because the company operates through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  its earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
company management estimates that foreign exchange translation increased earnings per share by cents in fiscal year most of the company s products are manufactured in the united states  puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the british pound the pound  the euro  the japanese yen the yen  swiss franc  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the singapore dollar  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro  thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary or a reduction in the sales price from the selling subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
in fiscal year  the pound  euro  yen  swiss franc  australian dollar  canadian dollar and singapore dollar strengthened by approximately      and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the euro strengthened against the pound by approximately 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  company management does not provide such estimated effects and reports only the translation effect to earnings per share disclosed above 
the company is also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen  euro  pound and swiss franc denominated receivables and payables 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by opening forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
the company does not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at july   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates as of july   net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to its financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 

table of contents the company s debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the company manages interest rate exposure by portfolio balancing including employing interest rate swaps 
including the effect of interest rate swaps  the company s debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   compared to variable rate at july  as of july   the company had a cash flow interest rate swap ie  variable to fixed rate swap with a notional amount of  the fair value of the interest rate swap at july  was a liability of the cash flows on the above mentioned interest rate swap mirror the cash flows of the hedged underlying debt instrument 
the company does not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
for the year ended july   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical shift in market interest rates for fiscal year eg  if an assumed market interest rate of increased to could have an adverse affect on interest of approximately
