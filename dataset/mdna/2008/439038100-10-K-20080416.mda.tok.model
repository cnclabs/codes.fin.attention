item a 
risk factors the company s business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  the company s business  financial condition  and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones the company faces 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to the company or that it currently believes to be immaterial that could affect its business 
the company may lose market share due to competition  which would decrease future sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with many domestic and foreign manufacturers 
some competitors have greater financial resources than the company and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign producers has increased dramatically in the past few years 
the company may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  including increases in supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  the company may not be able to continue to differentiate its products through styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of its competitors 
in addition  large retail furniture dealers have the ability and could at any time begin to obtain offshore sourcing on their own 
as a result  the company is continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which may lower sales and earnings 
an economic downturn could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
home furnishings are generally considered a postponeable purchase by most consumers 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  the company s primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in the company s sales and earnings 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  and geopolitical factors are particularly significant economic indicators for the company 
failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact the company s business and decrease sales and earnings 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes 
if the company fails to anticipate or timely respond to these changes it may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could result in lower sales and earnings 
a loss of several large customers through business consolidations  failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in future sales and earnings 
the loss of several of the company s major customers through business consolidations or failures or otherwise  could materially adversely affect the sales and earnings of the company 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to the company by a customer whose business fails may become uncollectible 
the company s ability to grow sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of its business strategies 
since  the company has transitioned from manufacturing most of its products to sourcing most of its products from offshore suppliers 
as a result  the company is now primarily a design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company 
the company s ability to maintain and grow sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of its overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing  distributing and servicing its products 
the company must also make good decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets 
since the company has exited domestic manufacturing of wood furniture and is now completely dependent on offshore suppliers for wood and metal furniture products  the company must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow it to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with its global sourcing suppliers 
the company also must continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect the company s ability to grow sales and earnings 
the company depends on suppliers in china for a high proportion of its imported furniture products  and a disruption in supply from china or from the company s most significant chinese supplier could adversely affect the company s ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and the costs of these products to the company 
in fiscal  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of the company s import purchases  and the factory in china from which the company directly sources the largest portion of its import products accounted for approximately of the company s worldwide purchases of imported products 
a sudden disruption in the company s supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact the company s ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  the company believes that it would have sufficient inventory to adequately meet demand for approximately three months 
the company believes that it could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at its own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if the company were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in the company s supply chain from its largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which the company obtains its products could adversely affect net sales and profit margins 
for imported products  the company generally negotiates firm pricing with its foreign suppliers in us dollars for periods typically of at least one year 
the company accepts the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
since the company transacts its imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price the company must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could adversely impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods 
the company s dependence on offshore suppliers could  over time  adversely affect its ability to service customers  which could lower future sales and earnings 
in march  the company exited domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
the company now relies exclusively on offshore suppliers for its wood and metal furniture products 
the company s offshore suppliers may not supply goods that meet the company s quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if the company s suppliers do not meet the company s specifications  the company may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from offshore vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured wood and metal furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues 
the company s failure to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption by a major offshore supplier could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in decreased sales and earnings 
because the company relies on offshore sourcing for all of its wood and metal products  and for some of its upholstered products  it is subject to changes in local government regulations  which could result in a decrease in earnings 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as laws and regulations in the foreign countries where the company sources its products could have adverse impacts on the company 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to the company s customers 
international trade policies of the united states and the countries where the company sources its finished products could adversely affect the company 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports could increase the company s costs and decrease its earnings 
for example in  the us department of commerce imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed were of sufficient magnitude to alter the company s import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these tariffs are subject to review and could be increased in the future 
the company may engage in acquisitions and investments in businesses  which could disrupt the company s business  dilute its earnings per share and decrease the value of its common stock 
the company may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that the company believes offer competitive advantages 
however  the company may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that negatively affect the company or results in the company paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
the company may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into the company s current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt the company s ongoing business or distract management from the company s ongoing business 
the company may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination thereof 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share 
if demand for the company s domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and the company responds by realigning manufacturing  the company s near term earnings could decrease 
since march  the company s domestic manufacturing operations consist solely of upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for the company s domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
the company may decide to source certain products from offshore suppliers  instead of continuing to manufacture them domestically 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in the company s near term earnings before the expected cost reductions from realignment are realized 
the company may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials for the company s domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect the company s ability to provide goods to its customers and increase costs  any of which could decrease the company s sales and earnings 
the company uses various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
the company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
the company does not have long term supply contracts with its suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality and availability of required raw materials could negatively affect the company s ability to meet the demands of its customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the loss of future sales 
the company may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to its customers due to competition and market pressures 
the company may experience impairment of its long lived assets  which would decrease earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has substantial long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks  trade names and goodwill  which based upon the outcome of the annual test  could result in the write down of all or a portion of these assets 
a write down of the company s assets would  in turn  reduce its earnings and net worth

item legal proceedings in an audit of the company s and federal income tax returns  the irs took the position that the timing of certain of the company s tax deductions for its k retirement plan constituted a listed transaction  which the company had failed to disclose in its tax returns for those years 
listed transactions are transactions that are the same as  or substantially similar to  transactions that the irs has identified as having a tax avoidance purpose 
in preparing its federal income tax returns for each fiscal year  the company deducted certain contributions and costs related to its k that were incurred during the one month period falling after the close of its fiscal year  which ended november in each year  but before the end of the plan s year  which ended december of each year 
because these deductions were attributable to compensation earned by plan participants during the month after the end of the company s taxable year  the irs took the position that these deductions constituted a listed transaction 
the cumulative effect of these deductions amounted to  or  in federal income tax through november  the irs assessed a penalty under section a b of the internal revenue code in the amount of  for failure to disclose a listed transaction on the company s federal income tax return 
an accuracy related penalty under section a c of the internal revenue code  for an understatement with respect to a listed or reportable transaction  was also assessed for  both penalties were paid in full during the fiscal year ended february  the company has discontinued the deductions that gave rise to these penalties

on august   the company approved a change in its fiscal year 
after the fiscal year that ended november   the company s fiscal years will end on the sunday nearest to january in addition  starting with the fiscal year that began january   the company adopted quarterly periods based on thirteen week reporting periods which will end on a sunday rather than quarterly periods consisting of three calendar months 
as a result  each quarterly period generally will be thirteen weeks  or days  long 
however  since the company s fiscal year will end on the sunday closest to january  in some years generally once every six years the fourth quarter will be fourteen weeks long and the fiscal year will consist of weeks eg the fiscal year that ended february  was weeks 
for more information about the changes in the company s fiscal year and quarterly periods  please refer to the company s form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on september  in connection with the change in its fiscal year  the company completed a two month transition period that began december  and ended january  and filed a transition report on form q for that period on march  the financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k cover the fifty three week period that began january  and ended on february  the financial statements also include the two month transition period that began december  and ended january  and the twelve month periods that ended november  and the company did not recast the financial statements for the twelve month periods ended november  and  principally because the financial reporting processes in place for those periods included certain procedures that were completed only on a quarterly basis 
consequently  to recast those periods would have been impractical and would not have been cost justified 
overview since  the company has operated in a sluggish economy impacted by low to moderate levels of consumer confidence and growing consumer preference for lower priced imported furniture products 
the company s results of operations have been affected in opposing ways by lower priced imported furniture 
first  net sales of the company s imported wood and metal furniture as a percentage of total wood and metal net sales have experienced significant growth during this five year period  and bradington young imported upholstered furniture net sales have experienced significant growth since net sales of imported products  as a percentage of total net sales have increased to record levels every year from to and have grown as a percentage of total net sales  from in to in fiscal second  the company s domestic wood furniture manufacturing operations suffered from lower demand and significant declines in volume for bedroom  home office  home entertainment and other products 
these declines led to the decision to close the company s last domestic wood manufacturing plant  located in martinsville  va 
in march  which marked the company s exit from domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
prior to this  the company had closed its roanoke  va 
facility in august  pleasant garden  nc facility in  maiden  nc facility in and kernersville  nc facility in the company also reduced its workforce at the martinsville  va 
facility in and operated on reduced work schedules at the company s wood furniture manufacturing facilities over most of the period since the company s domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing operations at bradington young experienced declining year over year shipments in fiscal  fiscal and in the fiscal third and fourth quarters  and reduced work schedules since the fiscal fourth quarter 
results of operations for the fifty three weeks ended february  reflect the company s transformation into a home furnishings design  marketing and logistics company with world wide sourcing capabilities 
with the closing of its last domestic wood furniture plant during the fiscal first quarter  the company is now focused on imported wood and metal and domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of sam moore furniture industries  inc  a bedford  virginia manufacturer of upscale occasional chairs with an emphasis on fabric to frame customization in the upper medium to high end price niches 
the company began operating the business as sam moore furniture llc during the fiscal second quarter 
on december   the company completed its acquisition of certain assets of opus designs furniture  llc  a specialist in moderately priced imported youth bedroom furniture 
the company has integrated this business with its existing imported wood and metal furniture business and now offers this brand to customers as opus designs by hooker 
because fiscal included three more shipping days than fiscal  due to the change in the fiscal year format  management s discussion of results of operations includes information regarding profitability performance as a percentage of net sales and daily average sales rates 
following are the principal factors that impacted the company s results of operations during the week period ended february  based on actual shipping days in each period  average daily net sales declined during the day fiscal year compared to the day fiscal year 
the decline in average daily net sales continues to mirror the year over year decline in incoming order rates the company has experienced since the fiscal third quarter resulting from the industry wide slow down in business at retail 
operating margin during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year was favorably impacted by a million  or  decline in restructuring and asset impairment related charges  an improvement in gross profit margin to of net sales compared with in the prior fiscal year  principally as a result of the higher proportion of imported wood and metal products sold and lower delivered cost of those imported products primarily lower inbound freight and delivery costs as a percentage of net sales  partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales  due to the decline in net sales 
these expenses actually declined by million  or  driven primarily by reductions in temporary warehousing and storage costs for imported wood and metal furniture products  lower early retirement and non cash employee stock ownership plan esop costs the esop was terminated in january  lower selling expenses  and a gain on the settlement of a corporate owned life insurance policy in connection with the death of a former executive of the company  partially offset by the selling and administrative expenses incurred by sam moore and the donation of two showrooms  located in high point  nc formerly operated by bradington young to a local university  in december  and the inclusion of the operations of sam moore furniture in the company s results of operations as of the beginning of the fiscal second quarter 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items for the annual periods included in the consolidated statements of income fifty three weeks ended twelve months ended february  november  november  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  the company reported net sales of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal net sales of hooker s wood and metal furniture decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal  principally due to lower unit volume 
the decline in unit volume was attributed to a sharp decline in domestically produced wood furniture sales as a result of exiting domestic wood manufacturing in march and the industry wide slow down in business at retail 
based on actual shipping days in each period  average daily net sales declined to million per day during the day fiscal year compared to million per day during the day fiscal year 
the company experienced lower average daily unit volume shipments overall and in every product category except bradington young imported leather upholstery  which experienced a slight increase  comparing fiscal to fiscal sam moore fabric upholstery sales amounted to million for the three quarters since it was acquired at the beginning of the fiscal second quarter 
overall  average selling prices declined slightly 
the primary contributor to the overall decline was the sharp decline in domestically produced wood furniture average selling prices  principally due to sharp discounting offered on these discontinued products 
the company experienced slight increases in average selling prices for imported wood and metal and bradington young imported and domestically produced leather upholstered furniture 
average selling prices for imported wood and metal furniture during fiscal year increased in part due to the mix of products shipped and lower discounting  compared to fiscal year while average selling prices per unit for both bradington young domestically produced and imported leather upholstered furniture increased  bradington young s overall per unit average selling price declined slightly  due to the higher proportion of imported products shipped

the company anticipates that these changes will result in slightly improved operating margins  increased sales  due to expanded product offerings  reduced site operation and occupancy costs  and lower inventory carrying costs 
during the year  bradington young and sam moore launched a number of new domestic and imported products 
going forward  the company expects that bradington young and sam moore will retain their business for domestically produced goods and expand sales of their imported products 
following its acquisition  sam moore s product distribution was expanded through hooker s independent sales representatives 
while sam moore operated at a loss in fiscal  the company believes that this improved market penetration will result in increased sales once economic conditions improve and marginal profitability for sam moore in fiscal year hooker continues to offer its store within a store displays with the company s existing dealers through smartliving showplace galleries dedicated exclusively to multi category and whole home collections under the hooker and bradington young brands 
the mission of the smartliving program is to develop progressive partnerships with retailers consisting of a merchandising and marketing plan to drive increased sales and profitability and positively impact consumers purchase decisions  satisfaction and loyalty through an enhanced shopping experience 
the company expects business conditions will remain challenging well into fiscal based on industry forecasts for a lower growth rate in furniture shipments and a decline in the company s incoming orders since the fourth quarter 
although net sales growth will continue to be challenging  the company expects improved profitability because of the steps it has taken to reduce costs and expand the company s product offerings 
environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of its business operations  the company s manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
the company is in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which the company believes is material to its results of operations or financial position 
the company s policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with the company s environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that actual results will deviate materially from its estimates related to the company s accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by management of the company and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from the company s estimate 
valuation of inventories 
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of the company s inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of goods sold  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of goods sold and lower profitability as compared to the fifo method 
the company evaluates its inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
the company establishes an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment by management and actual values may differ materially from the company s estimate 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of those assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s domestic wood furniture manufacturing operations have suffered from lower demand and significant declines in volume for its bedroom  home office and home entertainment products  principally due to competition from lower priced imported furniture products 
these declines led to the company s exit from domestic wood manufacturing with the closing of the company s martinsville  va 
facility in march  roanoke  va 
facility in august  pleasant garden  nc facility in october  maiden  nc facility in october and kernersville  nc facility in august as a result of these plant closings  the company recorded asset impairment charges to write down the carrying value of the related assets to fair market value 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when management commits to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees affected by the closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
the company recognizes liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of manufacturing facilities are based on the company s best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
management reassesses its accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements with respect to interest rates 
the company s obligations under its lines of credit and term loan bear interest at variable rates 
the outstanding balance under the company s term loan amounted to million as of february  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate of interest on its term loan at through the notional principal value of the swap agreement is substantially equal to the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
for imported products  the company generally negotiates firm pricing denominated in us dollars with its foreign suppliers  for periods typically of at least one year 
the company accepts the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
most of the company s imports are purchased from china 
the chinese currency  formerly pegged to the us dollar  now floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in additional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since the company transacts its imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price the company pays for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
the company generally expects to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices it charges for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods
