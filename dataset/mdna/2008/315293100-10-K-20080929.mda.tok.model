risk factors 
risks inherent in the distribution of propane weather conditions may reduce the demand for propane  our financial condition is vulnerable to warm winters and poor weather in the grilling season 
weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  our sales volumes of propane are highest during the five month winter heating season of november through march and are directly affected by the temperatures during these months 
during fiscal  approximately of our propane sales volume was attributable to sales during the winter heating season 
actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year  which may significantly affect our financial performance 
furthermore  variations in weather in one or more regions in which we operate can significantly affect our total propane sales volume and therefore our realized profits 
a negative effect on our sales volume may in turn affect our financial position or results of operations 
the agricultural demand for propane is also affected by weather  as dry or warm weather during the harvest season may reduce the demand for propane used in some crop drying applications 
our portable tank exchange operations experience higher volumes in the spring and summer  which includes the majority of the grilling season 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the grilling season  can negatively affect our portable tank exchange revenues 
in addition  poor weather may reduce consumers propensity to purchase and use grills and other propane fueled appliances thereby reducing demand for portable tank exchange as well as the demand for our outdoor products 
sudden and sharp propane price increases cannot be passed on to customers with contracted pricing arrangements and will adversely affect our profit margins if they are not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 
gross margin from the distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents per gallon difference between the sales price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations 
we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our retail customers that provide for contracted sales prices for a specified period of time 
the wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions and may fluctuate based on changes in demand  supply and other energy commodity prices 
propane prices tend to correlate primarily with crude oil and natural gas prices 
we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchasing  storing  transporting  and selling of propane 
however  sudden and sharp propane price increases cannot be passed on to customers with contracted pricing arrangements 
therefore  these commitments expose us to product price risk and reduced profit margins if those transactions are not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 
hurricanes and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
hurricanes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy thousands of business structures and homes and  if occurring in the gulf coast region of the united states  could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products 
disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
damages and higher prices caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers 
the propane distribution business is highly competitive  which may negatively affect our sales volumes and or our results of operations 
our profitability is affected by the competition for customers among all of the participants in the propane distribution business 
we compete with a number of large national and regional firms and several thousand small independent firms 
because of the relatively low barriers to entry into the propane market  there is the potential for small independent propane distributors  as well as other companies not previously engaged in propane distribution  to compete with us 
some rural electric cooperatives and fuel oil distributors have expanded their businesses to include propane distribution 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of additional competition in the future 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we do 
should a competitor attempt to increase market share by reducing prices  our operating margins and customer base may be negatively impacted 
generally  warmer than normal weather and increasing fuel prices further intensifies competition 
we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends on our service reliability  our responsiveness to customers  and our ability to maintain competitive propane prices and control our operating expenses 
the propane distribution industry is a mature one  which may limit our growth 
the propane distribution industry is a mature one 
we foresee only limited growth in total national demand for propane in the near future 
year to year industry volumes are primarily impacted by fluctuations in temperatures and economic conditions 
our ability to grow our sales volumes within the propane distribution industry is primarily dependent upon our ability to acquire other propane distributors  to integrate those acquisitions into our operations  and upon the success of our marketing efforts to acquire new customers 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the propane distribution business  we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers 
the propane distribution business faces competition from other energy sources  which may reduce the existing demand for our propane 
propane competes with other sources of energy  some of which can be less costly for equivalent energy value 
we compete for customers against suppliers of electricity  natural gas and fuel oil 
electricity is a major competitor of propane  but propane has historically enjoyed a competitive price advantage over electricity 
except for some industrial and commercial applications  propane is generally not competitive with natural gas in areas where natural gas pipelines already exist because such pipelines generally make it possible for the delivered cost of natural gas to be less expensive than the bulk delivery of propane 
the expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has historically been inhibited by the capital cost required to expand distribution and pipeline systems  however  the gradual expansion of the nation s natural gas distribution systems has resulted in the availability of natural gas in areas that were previously dependent upon propane 
although propane is similar to fuel oil in some applications and market demand  propane and fuel oil compete to a lesser extent primarily because of the cost of converting from one to the other and due to the fact that both fuel oil and propane have generally developed their own distinct geographic markets 
we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our financial position or results of operations 
energy efficiency and technology advances may affect demand for propane  increases in propane prices may cause our residential customers to increase their conservation efforts 
the national trend toward increased conservation and technological advances  including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices  has reduced the demand for propane in our industry 
we cannot predict the materiality of the effect of future conservation measures or the effect that any technological advances in heating  conservation  energy generation or other devices might have on our operations 
as the price of propane increases  some of our customers tend to increase their conservation efforts and thereby decrease their consumption of propane 
current economic and political conditions may harm the energy business disproportionately to other industries 
deteriorating regional and global economic conditions and the effects of ongoing military actions may cause significant disruptions to commerce throughout the world 
if those disruptions occur in areas of the world which are tied to the energy industry  such as the middle east  it is most likely that our industry will be either affected first or affected to a greater extent than other industries 
these conditions or disruptions may impair our ability to effectively market or acquire propane  or impair our ability to raise equity or debt capital for acquisitions  capital expenditures or ongoing operations 
motor fuel prices are at relatively high levels and rising motor fuel prices may adversely affect our profits 
motor fuel is a significant operating expense for us in connection with the delivery of propane to our customers 
rising motor fuel prices have resulted in increased transportation costs to us 
the price and supply of motor fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events we cannot control  such as geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions  regional production patterns and weather concerns 
as a result  current motor fuel prices  and any increases in these prices  may adversely affect our profitability and competitiveness 
the revenues received from our portable tank exchange are concentrated with a limited number of retailers under non exclusive arrangements that may be terminated at will 
the propane gallons sales that we generate from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange are concentrated with a limited number of retailers 
if one or more of these retailers were to materially reduce or terminate its business with us  the results from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange operations may decline 
for fiscal  three retailers represented approximately of our portable tank exchange s net revenues 
none of our significant retail accounts associated with our portable tank exchange operations are contractually bound to offer portable tank exchange service or products 
therefore  retailers can discontinue our delivery of propane to them by portable tank exchange service  or sales of our propane related products  at any time and accept a competitor s delivery of propane by portable tank exchange  or its related propane products or none at all 
continued relations with a retailer depend upon various factors  including price  customer service  consumer demand and competition 
in addition  most of our significant retailers have multiple vendor policies and may seek to accept a competitor s delivery of propane by portable tank exchange  or accept products competitive with our propane related products  at new or existing locations of these significant retailers 
if any significant retailer materially reduces  terminates or requires price reductions or other adverse modifications in our selling terms  our results from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange operations may decline 
if the independently owned distributors that some of our customers rely upon for the delivery of propane by portable tank exchange do not perform up to the expectations of such customers  if we encounter difficulties in managing the operations of these distributors or if we or these distributors are not able to manage growth effectively  our relationships with our customers may be adversely impacted and our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange may decline 
we rely in part on independently owned distributors to deliver our propane for a retailer s portable tank exchange service 
accordingly  our success depends on our ability to maintain and manage distributor relationships and operations and on the distributors ability to set up and adequately service accounts 
we exercise only limited influence over the resources that the independently owned distributors devote to the delivery of propane by portable tank exchange 
national retailers impose demanding service requirements on us  and we could experience a loss of consumer or retailer goodwill if our distributors do not adhere to our quality control and service guidelines or fail to ensure the timely delivery of an adequate supply of propane by portable tank exchange at retail locations 
the poor performance of a single distributor to a national retailer could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer and cause our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange to that particular retailer to decline 
in addition  the number of retail locations accepting delivery of our propane by portable tank exchange and  subsequently  the retailer s corresponding sales have historically grown significantly along with the creation of our distributor network 
accordingly  our distributors must be able to adequately service an increasing number of retail accounts 
if we or our independent distributors fail to manage growth effectively  our financial results from our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange may decline 
if we are unable to manage the impact of overfill prevention device valve guidelines  our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange may decline 
guidelines published by the national fire protection association in the current form of pamphlet and adopted in many states require that all portable propane tanks refilled after april  must be fitted with an overfill prevention valve 
if we or our distributors cannot satisfy the demand for compliant portable propane tanks such that our retailers maintain an adequate supply  our retailer relationships and our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange may decline 
in addition  for some of our customers  we have fixed in advance the price of propane per portable tank exchange unit charged to our retailers 
when pricing  we make assumptions with regard to the number of portable tanks that will already have an overfill prevention valve when presented for exchange  on which our margins will be greater  and the number of tanks that will need an overfill prevention valve 
if our actual experience is inconsistent with our assumptions  our margins on sales to that retailer may be lower than expected  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations of our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange 
potential retail partners may not be able to obtain necessary permits or may be substantially delayed in obtaining necessary permits  which may adversely impact our ability to increase our delivery of propane by portable tank exchange to new retail locations 
local ordinances  which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  generally require retailers to obtain permits to store and sell propane tanks 
these ordinances influence retailers acceptance of propane by portable tank exchange  distribution methods  propane tank packaging and storage 
the ability and time required to obtain permits varies by jurisdiction 
delays in obtaining permits have from time to time significantly delayed the installation of new retail locations 
some jurisdictions have refused to issue the necessary permits  which has prevented some installations 
some jurisdictions may also impose additional restrictions on our ability to market and our distributors ability to transport propane tanks or otherwise maintain its portable tank exchange services 
risks inherent to our business our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations 
we have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations 
as of july  we had total indebtedness of approximately  million  ferrellgas partners had partners capital of approximately million  we had availability under our credit facilities of approximately million  and we had aggregate future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases of approximately million  provided  however  if we elect to purchase the underlying assets at the end of the lease terms  such aggregate buyout would be million 
we have long and short term payment obligations with maturity dates ranging from fiscal to that bear interest at rates ranging from to 
these obligations do not contain any sinking fund provisions but do require annual aggregate principal payments  without premium  during the following fiscal years of approximately million  million  million  million  million  and million thereafter 
amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facilities will mature on august  and april   unless extended or renewed 
all of the indebtedness and other obligations described above are obligations of the operating partnership except for million of senior debt due issued by ferrellgas partners and ferrellgas partners finance corp 
this million in principal amount of senior notes also contains no sinking fund provisions 
subject to the restrictions governing the operating partnership s indebtedness and other financial obligations and the indenture governing ferrellgas partners outstanding senior notes due  we may incur significant additional indebtedness and other financial obligations  which may be secured and or structurally senior to any debt securities we may issue 
our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences to our security holders 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our securities  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates since some of our debt is  and will continue to be  at variable rates of interest  impair our operating capacity and cash flows if we fail to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of that failure that is not cured or waived  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund distributions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general partnership requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt 
ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may be unable to refinance their indebtedness or pay that indebtedness if it becomes due earlier than scheduled 
if ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership is unable to meet their debt service obligations or other financial obligations  they could be forced to restructure or refinance their indebtedness  enter into other necessary financial transactions  seek additional equity capital  or sell their assets 
they may then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell their assets on satisfactory terms  if at all 
their failure to make payments  whether after acceleration of the due date of that indebtedness or otherwise  or our failure to refinance the indebtedness would impair their operating capacity and cash flows 
restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility 
the indenture governing the outstanding notes of ferrellgas partners and the agreements governing the operating partnership s indebtedness and other financial obligations contain  and any indenture that will govern debt securities issued by ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may contain  various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries of ours to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  make distributions to our unitholders  purchase or redeem our outstanding equity interests or subordinated debt  make specified investments  create or incur liens  sell assets  engage in specified transactions with affiliates  restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make specified payments  loans  guarantees and transfers of assets or interests in assets  engage in sale leaseback transactions  effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies or a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets  and engage in other lines of business 
these restrictions could limit the ability of ferrellgas partners  the operating partnership and our other subsidiaries to obtain future financings  to make needed capital expenditures  to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or to conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
some of the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations also require the maintenance of specified financial ratios and the satisfaction of other financial conditions 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions can be affected by unexpected downturns in business operations beyond our control  such as significantly warmer than normal weather  a volatile energy commodity cost environment or an economic downturn 
accordingly  we may be unable to meet these ratios and conditions 
this failure could impair our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions  even if sufficient funds were available 
our breach of any of these covenants or the operating partnership s failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness  which could cause such indebtedness or other financial obligations  and by reason of cross default provisions  any of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership s other outstanding notes or future debt securities  to become immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral  if any 
if the lenders of the operating partnership s indebtedness or other financial obligations accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed  we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations  including our outstanding notes and any future debt securities 
our results of operations and our ability to make distributions or pay interest or principal on debt securities could be negatively impacted by price and inventory risk and management of these risks 
the amount of gross profit we make depends significantly on the excess of the sales price over our costs to purchase and distribute propane 
consequently  our profitability is sensitive to changes in energy prices  in particular  changes in wholesale propane prices 
propane is a commodity whose market price can fluctuate significantly based on changes in supply  changes in other energy prices or other market conditions 
we have no control over these market conditions 
in general  product supply contracts permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
any increase in the price of product could reduce our gross profit because we may not be able to immediately pass rapid increases in such costs  or costs to distribute product  on to our customers 
while we generally attempt to minimize our inventory risk by purchasing product on a short term basis  we may purchase and store propane or other natural gas liquids depending on inventory and price outlooks 
we may purchase large volumes of propane at the then current market price during periods of low demand and low prices  which generally occurs during the summer months 
the market price for propane could fall below the price at which we made the purchases  which would adversely affect our profits or cause sales from that inventory to be unprofitable 
a portion of our inventory is purchased under supply contracts that typically have a one year term and at a price that fluctuates based on the prevailing market prices 
our contracts with our independent portable tank exchange distributors provide for a portion of our payment to the distributor to be based upon a price that fluctuates based on the prevailing propane market prices 
to limit our overall price risk  we may purchase and store physical product and enter into fixed price over the counter energy commodity forward contracts  swaps and options that have terms of up to months 
this strategy may not be effective in limiting our price risk if  for example  weather conditions significantly reduce customer demand  or market or weather conditions prevent the delivery of physical product during periods of peak demand  resulting in excess physical product after the end of the winter heating season and the expiration of related forward or option contracts 
some of our sales are pursuant to commitments at contracted price agreements 
to manage these commitments  we may purchase and store physical product and or enter into fixed price over the counter energy commodity forward contracts  swaps and options 
we may enter into these agreements at volume levels that we believe are necessary to mitigate the price risk related to our anticipated sales volumes under the commitments 
if the price of propane declines and our customers purchase less propane than we have purchased from our suppliers  we could incur losses when we sell the excess volumes 
if the price of propane increases and our customers purchase more propane than we have purchased from our suppliers  we could incur losses when we are required to purchase additional propane to fulfill our customers orders 
the risk management of our inventory and contracts for the future purchase of product could impair our profitability if the price of product changes in ways we do not anticipate 
the board of directors of our general partner has adopted a commodity risk management policy which places specified restrictions on all of our commodity risk management activities such as limits on the types of commodities  loss limits  time limits on contracts and limitations on our ability to enter into derivative contracts 
the policy also requires the establishment of a risk management committee of senior executives 
this committee is responsible for monitoring commodity risk management activities  establishing and maintaining timely reporting and establishing and monitoring specific limits on the various commodity risk management activities 
these limits may be waived on a case by case basis by a majority vote of the risk management committee and or board of directors  depending on the specific limit being waived 
from time to time  for valid business reasons based on the facts and circumstances  authorization has been granted to allow specific commodity risk management positions to exceed established limits 
if we sustain material losses from our risk management activities due to our failure to anticipate future events  a failure of the policy  incorrect waivers or otherwise  our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest or principal of any debt securities may be negatively impacted as a result of such loss 
we are dependent on our principal suppliers  which increases the risks from an interruption in supply and transportation 
through our supply procurement activities  we purchased approximately of our propane from six suppliers during fiscal in addition  during extended periods of colder than normal weather  suppliers may temporarily run out of propane necessitating the transportation of propane by truck  rail car or other means from other areas 
if supplies from these sources were interrupted or difficulties in alternative transportation were to arise  the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and  at least on a short term basis  our margins could be reduced 
the availability of cash from our credit facilities may be impacted by many factors beyond our control 
we typically borrow on the operating partnership s credit facilities or sell accounts receivable under its accounts receivable securitization facility to fund our working capital requirements 
we may also borrow on the operating partnership s credit facilities to fund debt service payments  distributions to our unitholders  acquisition and capital expenditures 
we purchase product from suppliers and make payments with terms that are typically within five to ten days of delivery 
we believe that the availability of cash from the operating partnership s credit facilities and the accounts receivable securitization facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital needs 
however  if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in working capital requirements or have insufficient funds to fund distributions  this need could exceed our immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in working capital borrowings or letter of credit requirements may include a significant increase in the cost of propane  a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable  increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities  increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers  a significant downgrade in our credit rating leading to decreased trade credit  or a significant acquisition 
as is typical in our industry  our retail customers generally do not pay upon receipt  but pay between and days after delivery 
during the winter heating season  we experience significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels and thus a significant decline in working capital availability 
although we have the ability to fund working capital with borrowings from the operating partnership s credit facilities and sales of accounts receivable under its accounts receivable securitization facility  we cannot predict the effect that increases in propane prices and colder than normal winter weather may have on future working capital availability 
we may not be successful in making acquisitions and any acquisitions we make may not result in our anticipated results  in either case  this would potentially limit our growth  limit our ability to compete and impair our results of operations 
we have historically expanded our business through acquisitions 
we regularly consider and evaluate opportunities to acquire local  regional and national propane distributors 
we may choose to finance these acquisitions through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional common units or other securities 
we have substantial competition for acquisitions of propane companies 
although we believe there are numerous potential large and small acquisition candidates in our industry  there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire any of these candidates on economically acceptable terms  we will be able to successfully integrate acquired operations with any expected cost savings  any acquisitions made will not be dilutive to our earnings and distributions  any additional equity we issue as consideration for an acquisition will not be dilutive to our unitholders  or any additional debt we incur to finance an acquisition will not affect the operating partnership s ability to make distributions to ferrellgas partners or service the operating partnership s existing debt 
we are subject to operating and litigation risks  which may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling  storing and delivering of combustible liquids such as propane 
as a result  we have been  and are likely to be  a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we will maintain insurance policies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent 
however  we cannot guarantee that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 
we depend on particular management information systems to effectively manage all aspects of our delivery of propane 
we depend on our management information systems to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  maintain distributor and customer information  maintain cost efficient operations and assist in delivering propane on a timely basis 
in addition  our staff of management information systems professionals relies heavily on the support of several key personnel and vendors 
any disruption in the operation of those management information systems  loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems  termination of our relationship with one or more of these key vendors or failure to continue to modify such systems effectively as our business expands could negatively affect our business 
risks inherent to an investment in our debt securities ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership are required to distribute all of their available cash to their equity holders and ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting their future obligations to holders of their debt securities  which may limit the cash available to service those debt securities 
subject to the limitations on restricted payments contained in the indenture that governs ferrellgas partners outstanding notes  the instruments governing the outstanding indebtedness of the operating partnership and any applicable indenture that will govern any debt securities ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may issue  the partnership agreements of both ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership require us to distribute all of our available cash each fiscal quarter to our limited partners and our general partner and do not require us to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting obligations to holders of any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership 
available cash is generally all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and adjustments for net changes in reserves 
as a result of these distribution requirements  we do not expect either ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership to accumulate significant amounts of cash 
depending on the timing and amount of our cash distributions and because we are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting obligations to holders of any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership  such distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership 
debt securities of ferrellgas partners will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
debt securities of ferrellgas partners will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of creditors of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries  including the lenders under the operating partnership s indebtedness  the claims of lessors under the operating partnership s operating leases  the claims of the lenders and their affiliates under the operating partnership s accounts receivable securitization facility  debt securities  including any subordinated debt securities  issued by the operating partnership  and all other possible future creditors of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
this subordination is due to these creditors priority as to the assets of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries over ferrellgas partners claims as an equity holder in the operating partnership and  thereby  indirectly  the claims of holders of ferrellgas partners debt securities 
as a result  upon any distribution to these creditors in a bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding relating to ferrellgas partners or its property  the operating partnership s creditors will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to ferrellgas partners debt securities 
thereafter  the holders of ferrellgas partners debt securities will participate with its trade creditors and all other holders of its indebtedness in the assets remaining  if any 
in any of these cases  ferrellgas partners may have insufficient funds to pay all of its creditors  and holders of its debt securities may therefore receive less  ratably  than creditors of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
as of july   the operating partnership had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities to which any of the debt securities of ferrellgas partners will effectively rank junior 
all payments on any subordinated debt securities that we may issue will be subordinated to the payments of any amounts due on any senior indebtedness that we may have issued or incurred 
the right of the holders of subordinated debt securities to receive payment of any amounts due to them  whether interest  premium or principal  will be subordinated to the right of all of the holders of our senior indebtedness  as such term will be defined in the applicable subordinated debt indenture  to receive payments of all amounts due to them 
if an event of default on any of our senior indebtedness occurs  then until such event of default has been cured  we may be unable to make payments of any amounts due to the holders of our subordinated debt securities 
accordingly  in the event of insolvency  creditors who are holders of our senior indebtedness may recover more  ratably  than the holders of our subordinated debt securities 
debt securities of ferrellgas partners are expected to be non recourse to the operating partnership  which will limit remedies of the holders of ferrellgas partners debt securities 
ferrellgas partners obligations under any debt securities are expected to be non recourse to the operating partnership 
therefore  if ferrellgas partners should fail to pay the interest or principal on the notes or breach any of its other obligations under its debt securities or any applicable indenture  holders of debt securities of ferrellgas partners will not be able to obtain any such payments or obtain any other remedy from the operating partnership or its subsidiaries 
the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will not be liable for any of ferrellgas partners obligations under its debt securities or the applicable indenture 
ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may be unable to repurchase debt securities upon a change of control  it may be difficult to determine if a change of control has occurred 
upon the occurrence of change of control events as may be described from time to time in our filings with the sec and related to the issuance by ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership of debt securities  the applicable issuer or a third party may be required to make a change of control offer to repurchase those debt securities at a premium to their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the applicable issuer may not have the financial resources to purchase its debt securities in that circumstance  particularly if a change of control event triggers a similar repurchase requirement for  or results in the acceleration of  other indebtedness 
the indenture governing ferrellgas partners outstanding notes contains such a repurchase requirement 
some of the agreements governing the operating partnership s indebtedness currently provide that specified change of control events will result in the acceleration of the indebtedness under those agreements 
future debt agreements of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may also contain similar provisions 
the obligation to repay any accelerated indebtedness of the operating partnership will be structurally senior to ferrellgas partners obligations to repurchase its debt securities upon a change of control 
in addition  future debt agreements of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may contain other restrictions on the ability of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership to repurchase its debt securities upon a change of control 
these restrictions could prevent the applicable issuer from satisfying its obligations to purchase its debt securities unless it is able to refinance or obtain waivers under any indebtedness of ferrellgas partners or of the operating partnership containing these restrictions 
the applicable issuer s failure to make or consummate a change of control repurchase offer or pay the change of control purchase price when due may give the trustee and the holders of the debt securities particular rights as may be described from time to time in our filings with the sec 
in addition  one of the events that may constitute a change of control is a sale of all or substantially all of the applicable issuer s assets 
the meaning of substantially all varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and has no clearly established meaning under new york law  which is the law that will likely govern any indenture for the debt securities 
this ambiguity as to when a sale of substantially all of the applicable issuer s assets has occurred may make it difficult for holders of debt securities to determine whether the applicable issuer has properly identified  or failed to identify  a change of control 
there may be no active trading market for our debt securities  which may limit a holder s ability to sell our debt securities 
we do not intend to list the debt securities we may issue from time to time on any securities exchange or to seek approval for quotations through any automated quotation system 
an established market for the debt securities may not develop  or if one does develop  it may not be maintained 
although underwriters may advise us that they intend to make a market in the debt securities  they are not expected to be obligated to do so and may discontinue such market making activity at any time without notice 
in addition  market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the securities act and the exchange act 
for these reasons  we cannot assure a debt holder that a liquid market for the debt securities will develop  a debt holder will be able to sell its debt securities  or a debt holder will receive any specific price upon any sale of its debt securities 
if a public market for the debt securities did develop  the debt securities could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than their principal amount or purchase price  depending on many factors  including prevailing interest rates  the market for similar debt securities and our financial performance 
historically  the market for non investment grade debt  such as our debt securities  has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial fluctuations in the prices of these securities 
risks inherent to an investment in ferrellgas partners equity ferrellgas partners may sell additional limited partner interests  diluting existing interests of unitholders 
the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners generally allows ferrellgas partners to issue additional limited partner interests and other equity securities 
when ferrellgas partners issues additional equity securities  a unitholder s proportionate partnership interest will decrease 
such an issuance could negatively affect the amount of cash distributed to unitholders and the market price of common units 
the issuance of additional common units will also diminish the relative voting strength of the previously outstanding common units 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and other external factors 
although we are required to distribute all of our available cash  we cannot guarantee the amounts of available cash that will be distributed to the holders of our equity securities 
available cash is generally all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and adjustments for net changes in reserves 
the actual amounts of available cash will depend upon numerous factors  including cash flow generated by operations  weather in our areas of operation  borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  principal and interest payments made on our debt  the costs of acquisitions  including related debt service payments  restrictions contained in debt instruments  issuances of debt and equity securities  fluctuations in working capital  capital expenditures  adjustments in reserves made by our general partner in its discretion  prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors  a number of which will be beyond our control 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including from reserves and  subject to limitations  working capital borrowings 
cash distributions are not dependent on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
our general partner has broad discretion to determine the amount of available cash for distribution to holders of our equity securities through the establishment and maintenance of cash reserves  thereby potentially lessening and limiting the amount of available cash eligible for distribution 
our general partner determines the timing and amount of our distributions and has broad discretion in determining the amount of funds that will be recognized as available cash 
part of this discretion comes from the ability of our general partner to establish and make additions to our reserves 
decisions as to amounts to be placed in or released from reserves have a direct impact on the amount of available cash for distributions because increases and decreases in reserves are taken into account in computing available cash 
funds within or added to our reserves are not considered to be available cash and are therefore not required to be distributed 
each fiscal quarter  our general partner may  in its reasonable discretion  determine the amounts to be placed in or released from reserves  subject to restrictions on the purposes of the reserves 
reserves may be made  increased or decreased for any proper purpose  including  but not limited to  reserves to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations  including the establishment of reserves to fund the payment of interest and principal in the future of any debt securities of ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership  to provide for level distributions of cash notwithstanding the seasonality of our business  and to provide for future capital expenditures and other payments deemed by our general partner to be necessary or advisable 
the decision by our general partner to establish  increase or decrease our reserves may limit the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our equity securities 
holders of our equity securities will not receive payments required by such securities unless we are able to first satisfy our own obligations and the establishment of any reserves 
see the first risk factor under risks arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner 
the debt agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership may limit their ability to make distributions to holders of their equity securities 
the debt agreements governing ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership s outstanding indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that may limit or prohibit distributions to holders of their equity securities under various circumstances 
ferrellgas partners existing indenture generally prohibits it from making any distributions to unitholders if an event of default exists or would exist when such distribution is made  distributing amounts in excess of of available cash for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter if its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than to  or distributing amounts in excess of million less any restricted payments made for the prior sixteen fiscal quarters plus the aggregate cash contributions made to us during that period if its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than or equal to to 
see the first risk factor under risks arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner for a description of the restrictions on the operating partnership s ability to distribute cash to ferrellgas partners 
any indenture applicable to future issuances of debt securities by ferrellgas partners or the operating partnership may contain restrictions that are the same as or similar to those in their existing debt agreements 
the distribution priority to our common units owned by the public terminates no later than april  assuming that the restrictions under our debt agreements are met  our partnership agreements require us to distribute of our available cash to our unitholders on a quarterly basis 
available cash is generally all of our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and adjustments for net changes in reserves 
currently  the common units owned by the public have a right to receive distributions of available cash before any distributions of available cash are made on the common units owned by ferrell companies 
we must pay a distribution on the publicly held common units before we pay a distribution on the common units held by ferrell companies 
if there exists an outstanding amount of deferred distributions on the common units held by ferrell companies of million  the common units held by ferrell companies will be paid in the same manner as the publicly held common units 
while there are any deferred distributions outstanding on common units held by ferrell companies  we may not increase the distribution to our public common unitholders above the highest quarterly distribution paid on our common units for any of the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters 
after payment of all required distributions  we will use remaining available cash to reduce any amount previously deferred on the common units held by ferrell companies 
this distribution priority right is scheduled to end april   or earlier if there is a change of control  we dissolve or ferrell companies sells all of our common units held by it 
whether an extension of the expiration of the distribution priority is likely or unlikely involves several factors that are not currently known and or cannot be assessed until a time closer to the expiration date 
the termination of this distribution priority may lower the market price for our common units 
persons owning or more of ferrellgas partners common units cannot vote 
this limitation does not apply to common units owned by ferrell companies  our general partner and its affiliates 
all common units held by a person that owns or more of ferrellgas partners common units cannot be voted 
this provision may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or otherwise change management  and reduce the price at which our common units will trade under various circumstances 
this limitation does not apply to our general partner and its affiliates 
ferrell companies  the parent of our general partner  beneficially owns all of the outstanding capital stock of our general partner in addition to approximately of our common units 
risks arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner ferrellgas partners is a holding entity and has no material operations or assets 
accordingly  ferrellgas partners is dependent on distributions from the operating partnership to service its obligations 
these distributions are not guaranteed and may be restricted 
ferrellgas partners is a holding entity for our subsidiaries  including the operating partnership 
ferrellgas partners has no material operations and only limited assets 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
is ferrellgas partners wholly owned finance subsidiary  serves as a co obligor on any of its debt securities  conducts no business and has nominal assets 
accordingly  ferrellgas partners is dependent on cash distributions from the operating partnership and its subsidiaries to service obligations of ferrellgas partners 
the operating partnership is required to distribute all of its available cash each fiscal quarter  less the amount of cash reserves that our general partner determines is necessary or appropriate in its reasonable discretion to provide for the proper conduct of our business  to provide funds for distributions over the next four fiscal quarters or to comply with applicable law or with any of our debt or other agreements 
this discretion may limit the amount of available cash the operating partnership may distribute to ferrellgas partners each fiscal quarter 
holders of ferrellgas partners securities will not receive payments required by those securities unless the operating partnership is able to make distributions to ferrellgas partners after the operating partnership first satisfies its obligations under the terms of its own borrowing arrangements and reserves any necessary amounts to meet its own financial obligations 
in addition  the various agreements governing the operating partnership s indebtedness and other financing transactions permit quarterly distributions only so long as each distribution does not exceed a specified amount  the operating partnership meets a specified financial ratio and no default exists or would result from such distribution 
those agreements include the indentures governing the operating partnership s existing notes  credit facilities and an accounts receivable securitization facility 
each of these agreements contain various negative and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership and some of these agreements require the operating partnership to maintain specified financial ratios 
if the operating partnership violates any of these covenants or requirements  a default may result and distributions would be limited 
these covenants limit the operating partnership s ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  create or incur liens  sell assets  make restricted payments  loans and investments  enter into business combinations and asset sale transactions  and engage in other lines of business 
the ownership of our general partner could change if ferrell companies defaults on its outstanding indebtedness 
ferrell companies owns all of the outstanding capital stock of our general partner and beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common units 
ferrell companies has pledged the majority of its beneficially owned common units against its variable interest debt  which totaled million at july   with a scheduled maturity of december ferrell companies primary sources of income to pay its debt are dividends that it receives from our general partner and distributions received on the common units 
for fiscal  ferrell companies received approximately million from these sources 
if ferrell companies defaults on its debt  its lenders could acquire control of our general partner and the common units beneficially owned by it 
in that case  the lenders could change management of our general partner and operate the general partner with different objectives than current management 
unitholders have limits on their voting rights  our general partner manages and operates us  thereby generally precluding the participation of our unitholders in operational decisions 
our general partner manages and operates us 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business 
amendments to the agreement of limited partnership of ferrellgas partners may be proposed only by or with the consent of our general partner 
proposed amendments must generally be approved by holders of at least a majority of our outstanding common units 
unitholders will have no right to elect our general partner on an annual or other continuing basis  and our general partner may not be removed except pursuant to the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding units entitled to vote thereon  which includes the common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates  and upon the election of a successor general partner by the vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding common units entitled to vote 
because ferrell companies is the parent of our general partner and beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common units and james e 
ferrell  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of our general partner  indirectly owns approximately of our outstanding common units  amendments to the agreement of limited partnership of ferrellgas partners or the removal of our general partner may not be made if neither ferrell companies nor mr 
ferrell consent to such action 
our general partner has a limited call right with respect to the limited partner interests of ferrellgas partners 
if at any time less than of the then issued and outstanding limited partner interests of any class of ferrellgas partners are held by persons other than our general partner and its affiliates  our general partner has the right  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining limited partner interests of such class held by such unaffiliated persons at a price generally equal to the then current market price of limited partner interests of such class 
as a consequence  a unitholder may be required to sell its common units at a time when the unitholder may not desire to sell them or at a price that is less than the price desired to be received upon such sale 
unitholders may not have limited liability in specified circumstances and may be liable for the return of distributions 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states 
if it were determined that we had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute  or that the right  or the exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group  to remove or replace our general partner  make specified amendments to our partnership agreements  or take other action pursuant to our partnership agreements that constitutes participation in the control of our business  then the limited partners could be held liable in some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner 
in addition  under some circumstances a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution 
unitholders will not be liable for assessments in addition to their initial capital investment in our common units 
under delaware general corporate law  we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution causes all our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which recourse is limited to specific property are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount for three years from the distribution date 
under delaware law  an assignee that becomes a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership 
however  such an assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to that assignee at the time such assignee became a limited partner if the liabilities could not be determined from the partnership agreements 
our general partner s liability to us and our unitholders may be limited 
the partnership agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership contain language limiting the liability of our general partner to us and to our unitholders 
for example  those partnership agreements provide that the general partner does not breach any duty to us or our unitholders by borrowing funds or approving any borrowing  our general partner is protected even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to increase incentive distributions to our general partner  our general partner does not breach any duty to us or our unitholders by taking any actions consistent with the standards of reasonable discretion outlined in the definitions of available cash and cash from operations contained in our partnership agreements  and our general partner does not breach any standard of care or duty by resolving conflicts of interest unless our general partner acts in bad faith 
the modifications of state law standards of fiduciary duty contained in our partnership agreements may significantly limit the ability of unitholders to successfully challenge the actions of our general partner as being a breach of what would otherwise have been a fiduciary duty 
these standards include the highest duties of good faith  fairness and loyalty to the limited partners 
such a duty of loyalty would generally prohibit a general partner of a delaware limited partnership from taking any action or engaging in any transaction for which it has a conflict of interest 
under our partnership agreements  our general partner may exercise its broad discretion and authority in our management and the conduct of our operations as long as our general partner s actions are in our best interest 
our general partner and its affiliates may have conflicts with us 
the directors and officers of our general partner and its affiliates have fiduciary duties to manage itself in a manner that is beneficial to its stockholder 
at the same time  our general partner has fiduciary duties to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us and our unitholders 
therefore  our general partner s duties to us may conflict with the duties of its officers and directors to its stockholder 
matters in which  and reasons that  such conflicts of interest may arise include decisions of our general partner with respect to the amount and timing of our cash expenditures  borrowings  acquisitions  issuances of additional securities and changes in reserves in any quarter may affect the amount of incentive distributions we are obligated to pay our general partner  borrowings do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by our general partner to our unitholders even if these borrowings have the purpose or effect of directly or indirectly enabling us to make distributions to the holder of our incentive distribution rights  currently our general partner  or to hasten the expiration of the deferral period with respect to the common units held by ferrell companies  we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of our general partner and its affiliates  under the terms of our partnership agreements  we must reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for costs incurred in managing and operating us  including costs incurred in rendering corporate staff and support services to us  our general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or causing us to enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities  neither our partnership agreements nor any of the other agreements  contracts and arrangements between us  on the one hand  and our general partner and its affiliates  on the other  are or will be the result of arms length negotiations  whenever possible  our general partner limits our liability under contractual arrangements to all or a portion of our assets  with the other party thereto having no recourse against our general partner or its assets  our partnership agreements permit our general partner to make these limitations even if we could have obtained more favorable terms if our general partner had not limited its liability  any agreements between us and our general partner or its affiliates will not grant to our unitholders  separate and apart from us  the right to enforce the obligations of our general partner or such affiliates in favor of us  therefore  our general partner will be primarily responsible for enforcing those obligations  our general partner may exercise its right to call for and purchase common units as provided in the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners or assign that right to one of its affiliates or to us  our partnership agreements provide that it will not constitute a breach of our general partner s fiduciary duties to us for its affiliates to engage in activities of the type conducted by us  other than retail propane sales to end users in the continental united states in the manner engaged in by our general partner immediately prior to our initial public offering  even if these activities are in direct competition with us  our general partner and its affiliates have no obligation to present business opportunities to us  our general partner selects the attorneys  accountants and others who perform services for us 
these persons may also perform services for our general partner and its affiliates 
our general partner is authorized to retain separate counsel for us or our unitholders  depending on the nature of the conflict that arises  and james e 
ferrell is the chief executive officer of our general partner and the chairman of its board of directors 
mr 
ferrell also owns other companies with whom we may  from time to time  conduct our ordinary business operations 
mr 
ferrell s ownership of these entities may conflict with his duties as an officer and director of our general partner  including our relationship and conduct of business with any of mr 
ferrell s companies 
see conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities below 
ferrell companies may transfer the ownership of our general partner which could cause a change of our management and affect the decisions made by our general partner regarding resolutions of conflicts of interest 
ferrell companies  the owner of our general partner  may transfer the capital stock of our general partner without the consent of our unitholders 
in such an instance  our general partner will remain bound by our partnership agreements 
if  however  through share ownership or otherwise  persons not now affiliated with our general partner were to acquire its general partner interest in us or effective control of our general partner  our management and resolutions of conflicts of interest  such as those described above  could change substantially 
our general partner may voluntarily withdraw or sell its general partner interest 
our general partner may withdraw as the general partner of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership without the approval of our unitholders 
our general partner may also sell its general partner interest in ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership without the approval of our unitholders 
any such withdrawal or sale could have a material adverse effect on us and could substantially change the management and resolutions of conflicts of interest  as described above 
our general partner can protect itself against dilution 
whenever we issue equity securities to any person other than our general partner and its affiliates  our general partner has the right to purchase additional limited partner interests on the same terms 
this allows our general partner to maintain its partnership interest in us 
no other unitholder has a similar right 
therefore  only our general partner may protect itself against dilution caused by our issuance of additional equity securities 
tax risks the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes or changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entity level taxation  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in us depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we believe that  under current law  we have been and will continue to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
one of the requirements for such classification is that at least of our gross income for each taxable year has been and will be qualifying income within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
whether we will continue to be classified as a partnership in part depends on our ability to meet this qualifying income test in the future 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay tax on our income at corporate rates  currently at the federal level  and we would probably pay additional state income taxes as well 
in addition  distributions would generally be taxable to the recipient as corporate distributions and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our unitholders and thus would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
a change in current law or a change in our business could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
our partnership agreements provide that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  provisions of our partnership agreements will be subject to change 
these changes would include a decrease in the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to reflect the impact of such law on us 
a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may reduce the market value of our common units and the costs of any contest will be borne by us and therefore indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from those expressed herein or from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of the positions we take  and some or all of these positions ultimately may not be sustained 
any contest with the irs may materially reduce the market value of our common units and the prices at which our common units trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne by us and therefore indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner 
unitholders may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us 
a unitholder will be required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on its share of our taxable income  even if it does not receive cash distributions from us 
a unitholder may not receive cash distributions equal to its share of our taxable income or even the tax liability that results from that income 
further  a unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash it receives upon the sale of its units 
the ratio of taxable income to cash distributions could be higher or lower than our estimates  which could result in a material reduction of the market value of our common units 
we estimate that a person who acquires common units in the calendar year and owns those common units through the record dates for all cash distributions payable for all periods within the calendar year will be allocated  on a cumulative basis  an amount of federal taxable income that will be less than of the cumulative cash distributed to such person for those periods 
the taxable income allocable to a unitholder for subsequent periods may constitute an increasing percentage of distributable cash 
these estimates are based on several assumptions and estimates that are subject to factors beyond our control 
accordingly  the actual percentage of distributions that will constitute taxable income could be higher or lower and any differences could result in a material reduction in the market value of our common units 
there are limits on the deductibility of losses in the case of unitholders subject to the passive loss rules generally  individuals  closely held corporations and regulated investment companies  any losses generated by us will only be available to offset our future income and cannot be used to offset income from other activities  including passive activities or investments 
unused losses may be deducted when the unitholder disposes of its entire investment in us in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party 
a unitholder s share of our net passive income may be offset by unused losses carried over from prior years  but not by losses from other passive activities  including losses from other publicly traded partnerships 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected 
if a unitholder sells their common units  the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions in excess of the total net taxable income the unitholder was allocated for a common unit  which decreased its tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to the unitholder if the common unit is sold at a price greater than its tax basis in that common unit  even if the price received is less than its original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing a gain  will likely be ordinary income to that unitholder 
should the irs successfully contest some positions we take  a selling unitholder could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions  without the benefit of decreased income in prior years 
in addition  if a unitholder sells its units  the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash that unitholder receives from the sale 
tax exempt entities  regulated investment companies  and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in additional tax liability or reporting requirements for them 
an investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts  regulated investment companies  generally known as mutual funds  and non us persons  raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax  including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and thus will be taxable to them 
net income from a qualified publicly traded partnership is qualifying income for a regulated investment company  or mutual fund 
however  no more than of the value of a regulated investment company s total assets may be invested in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships 
we expect to be treated as a qualified publicly traded partnership 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes  at the highest effective tax rate applicable to individuals  and non us persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and generally pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
certain information relating to a unitholder s investment may be subject to special irs reporting requirements 
treasury regulations require taxpayers to report particular information on form if they participate in a reportable transaction 
unitholders may be required to file this form with the irs 
a transaction may be a reportable transaction based upon any of several factors 
the irs may impose significant penalties on a unitholder for failure to comply with these disclosure requirements 
disclosure and information maintenance obligations are also imposed on material advisors that organize  manage or sell interests in reportable transactions  which may require us or our material advisors to maintain and disclose to the irs certain information relating to unitholders 
an audit of us may result in an adjustment or an audit of a unitholder s own tax return 
we may be audited by the irs and tax adjustments could be made 
the rights of a unitholder owning less than a interest in us to participate in the income tax audit process are very limited 
further  any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us 
a unitholder will bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of its personal tax return 
reporting of partnership tax information is complicated and subject to audits  we cannot guarantee conformity to irs requirements 
we will furnish each unitholder with a schedule k that sets forth that unitholder s allocable share of income  gains  losses and deductions 
in preparing these schedules  we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and adopt various depreciation and amortization methods 
we cannot guarantee that these schedules will yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the irs 
if any of the information on these schedules is successfully challenged by the irs  the character and amount of items of income  gain  loss or deduction previously reported by unitholders might change  and unitholders might be required to adjust their tax liability for prior years and incur interest and penalties with respect to those adjustments 
unitholders may lose tax benefits as a result of nonconforming depreciation conventions 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units  uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our common units to a purchaser of common units of the same class must be maintained 
to maintain uniformity and for other reasons  we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization conventions which we believe conform to treasury regulations under b of the internal revenue code 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could reduce the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
a successful challenge could also affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholder s tax returns 
as a result of investing in our common units  a unitholder will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where it does not live 
in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  such as state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property 
a unitholder will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we currently conduct business in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
it is a unitholder s responsibility to file all required united states federal  state and local tax returns 
states may subject partnerships to entity level taxation in the future  thereby decreasing the amount of cash available to us for distributions and potentially causing a decrease in our distribution levels  including a decrease in the minimum quarterly distribution 
several states have enacted or are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if additional states were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be reduced 
the partnership agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership each provide that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects one or both partnerships to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects one or both partnerships to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  provisions of one or both partnership agreements will be subject to change 
these changes would include a decrease in the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to reflect the impact of those taxes 
unitholders may have negative tax consequences if we default on our debt or sell assets 
if we default on any of our debt  the lenders will have the right to sue us for non payment 
that action could cause an investment loss and negative tax consequences for our unitholders through the realization of taxable income by unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution 
likewise  if we were to dispose of assets and realize a taxable gain while there is substantial debt outstanding and proceeds of the sale were applied to the debt  our unitholders could have increased taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution 
conflicts of interest conflicts of interest could arise as a result of the relationships between us  on the one hand  and our general partner and its affiliates  on the other 
the directors and officers of our general partner have fiduciary duties to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its stockholder 
at the same time  our general partner has fiduciary duties to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders 
the duties of our general partner to us and our unitholders  therefore  may conflict with the duties of the directors and officers of our general partner to its stockholder 
matters in which  and reasons that  such conflicts of interest may arise include decisions of our general partner with respect to the amount and timing of our cash expenditures  borrowings  acquisitions  issuances of additional securities and changes in reserves in any quarter may affect the amount of incentive distributions we are obligated to pay our general partner  borrowings do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by our general partner to our unitholders even if these borrowings have the purpose or effect of directly or indirectly enabling us to make distributions to the holder of our incentive distribution rights  currently our general partner  or to hasten the expiration of the deferral period with respect to the common units held by ferrell companies  we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of our general partner and its affiliates  under the terms of our partnership agreements  we must reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for costs incurred in managing and operating us  including costs incurred in rendering corporate staff and support services to us  our general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or causing us to enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities  neither our partnership agreements nor any of the other agreements  contracts and arrangements between us  on the one hand  and our general partner and its affiliates  on the other  are or will be the result of arms length negotiations  whenever possible  our general partner limits our liability under contractual arrangements to all or a portion of our assets  with the other party thereto having no recourse against our general partner or its assets  our partnership agreements permit our general partner to make these limitations even if we could have obtained more favorable terms if our general partner had not limited its liability  any agreements between us and our general partner or its affiliates will not grant to our unitholders  separate and apart from us  the right to enforce the obligations of our general partner or such affiliates in favor of us  therefore  our general partner will be primarily responsible for enforcing those obligations  our general partner may exercise its right to call for and purchase common units as provided in the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners or assign that right to one of its affiliates or to us  our partnership agreements provide that it will not constitute a breach of our general partner s fiduciary duties to us for its affiliates to engage in activities of the type conducted by us  other than retail propane sales to end users in the continental united states in the manner engaged in by our general partner immediately prior to our initial public offering  even if these activities are in direct competition with us  our general partner and its affiliates have no obligation to present business opportunities to us  our general partner selects the attorneys  accountants and others who perform services for us

fiduciary responsibilities unless otherwise provided for in a partnership agreement  delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith  fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit the general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 
our partnership agreements expressly permit our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest between itself or its affiliates  on the one hand  and us or our unitholders  on the other  and to consider  in resolving such conflicts of interest  the interests of other parties in addition to the interests of our unitholders 
in addition  the partnership agreement of ferrellgas partners provides that a purchaser of common units is deemed to have consented to specified conflicts of interest and actions of our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise be prohibited  including those described above  and to have agreed that such conflicts of interest and actions do not constitute a breach by our general partner of any duty stated or implied by law or equity 
our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under our partnership agreements or its duties to us or our unitholders if the resolution of such conflict is fair and reasonable to us 
any resolution of a conflict approved by the audit committee of our general partner is conclusively deemed fair and reasonable to us 
the latitude given in our partnership agreements to our general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a unitholder to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty 
the partnership agreements of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership expressly limit the liability of our general partner by providing that our general partner  its affiliates and their respective officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us  our unitholders or assignees thereof for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions if our general partner and such other persons acted in good faith 
in addition  we are required to indemnify our general partner  its affiliates and their respective officers  directors  employees  agents and trustees to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities  costs and expenses incurred by our general partner or such other persons if our general partner or such persons acted in good faith and in a manner it or they reasonably believed to be in  or in the case of a person other than our general partner not opposed to  the best interests of us and  with respect to any criminal proceedings  had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful

accordingly  and due to the reduced disclosure format  a discussion of the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources of ferrellgas partners finance corp 
and ferrellgas finance corp 
is not presented in this section 
the following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussions set forth in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections generally refer to ferrellgas partners and its consolidated subsidiaries 
however  in these discussions there exist two material differences between ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership 
those material differences are because ferrellgas partners has issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due fiscal  the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness  see the statements of earnings in their respective consolidated financial statements and note h long term debt in the respective notes to their consolidated financial statements  and ferrellgas partners issued common units in several transactions during fiscal overview we are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers primarily in the united states 
we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  and the largest national provider of propane by portable tank exchange as measured by our propane sales volumes in fiscal we serve approximately one million residential  industrial commercial  portable tank exchange  agricultural  wholesale and other customers in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the midwest  southeast  southwest and northwest regions of the united states 
the market for propane is seasonal because of increased demand during the winter months primarily for the purpose of providing heating in residential and commercial buildings 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are during the winter heating season of november through march 
however  our propane by portable tank exchanges sales volume provides us increased operating profits during our first and fourth fiscal quarters due to its counter seasonal business activities 
it also provides us the ability to better utilize our seasonal resources at our propane distribution locations 
other factors affecting our results of operations include competitive conditions  volatility in energy commodity prices  demand for propane  timing of acquisitions and general economic conditions in the united states 
we use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal 
we use the definition of normal temperatures based on information published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 
based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days 
heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage 
weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes during the winter heating season of november through march 
accordingly  the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given region  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage 
our gross margin from the retail distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents per gallon difference between the sale price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations 
our residential customers and portable tank exchange customers typically provide us a greater cents per gallon margin than our industrial commercial  agricultural  wholesale and other customers 
we track propane sales volumes  revenues propane and other gas liquids sales and gross margin propane and other gas liquids sales by customer  however  we are not able to specifically allocate operating and other costs in a manner that would determine their specific profitability with a high degree of accuracy 
the wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions and may fluctuate based on changes in demand  supply and other energy commodity prices  primarily crude oil and natural gas  as propane prices tend to correlate with the fluctuations of these underlying commodities 
we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our retail customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time 
these commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 
we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchase  storage  transport and sale of propane 
our business strategy is to maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform  capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale  expand our operations through disciplined acquisitions and internal growth  and align employee interests with our investors through significant employee ownership 
net earnings in fiscal were million compared to net earnings in fiscal of million 
the decrease in net earnings of million was primarily due to the following gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales decreased million primarily due to lower propane sales volumes and the decreased gross margin per gallon compared to the prior year  gross margin from revenues other increased million primarily due to increased fee income billed to customers  and operating expense decreased million primarily due a decrease in labor expense and a decrease in incentive and other compensation expense

liquidity and capital resources general our cash requirements include working capital requirements  debt service payments  funding distributions to our unitholders  acquisition and capital expenditures 
a quarterly distribution of was paid on september   to all common units that were outstanding on september  this represents the fifty sixth consecutive minimum quarterly distribution paid to our common unitholders dating back to october our working capital requirements are subject to  among other things  the price of propane  delays in the collection of receivables  volatility in energy commodity prices  liquidity imposed by insurance providers  downgrades in our credit ratings  decreased trade credit  significant acquisitions  the weather and other changes in the demand for propane 
relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements 
our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is generated during the winter heating season  which occurs during our second and third fiscal quarters 
our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts 
historically  we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters because fixed costs generally exceed revenues and related costs and expenses during the non peak heating season 
subject to meeting the financial tests discussed below  our general partner believes that the operating partnership will have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations  and to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations in fiscal in addition  our general partner believes that the operating partnership will have sufficient funds available to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient cash to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all of its common units in fiscal our credit facilities  public debt  private debt and accounts receivable securitization facility contain several financial tests and covenants restricting our ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on our debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
our general partner currently believes that the most restrictive of these tests are debt incurrence limitations under the terms of our credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities and limitations on the payment of distributions within our senior notes due the credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities generally limit the operating partnership s ability to incur debt if it exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
our senior notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met  assuming certain exceptions to this ratio limit have previously been exhausted 
this restriction places limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to our unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon our most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
our credit facilities  public debt  private debt and accounts receivable securitization facility do not contain early repayment provisions related to a potential decline in our credit rating 
as of july   we met all the required quarterly financial tests and covenants 
based upon current estimates of our cash flow  our general partner believes that we will be able to continue to meet all of the required quarterly financial tests and covenants for fiscal however  we may not meet the applicable financial tests in future quarters if we were to experience significantly warmer than normal winter temperatures  a continued volatile energy commodity cost environment  an unexpected downturn in business operations  or a general economic downturn in the united states 
this failure could have a materially adverse effect on our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions to our unitholders  even if sufficient funds were available 
depending on the circumstances  we may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt or the continued payment of the quarterly cash distribution to our unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
we expect our future capital expenditures and working capital needs to be provided by a combination of cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  the credit facilities or the accounts receivable securitization facility 
see additional information about the accounts receivable securitization facility in operating activities accounts receivable securitization 
in order to reduce existing indebtedness  fund future acquisitions and expansive capital projects  we may obtain funds from our facilities  we may issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing financing arrangements or we may issue additional equity securities  including  among others  common units

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the prior year period 
this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an million increase in working capital requirements and a million decrease in cash flow from operations 
the increase in working capital requirements was primarily due to million from the timing and increasing cost per gallon of inventory purchases and million from the timing and increasing sales price per gallon on accounts receivable collections 
these increases in working capital requirements were partially offset by million from the timing and increasing purchase price per gallon on accounts payable disbursements and a million increase in cash flow from the timing of customer s application of their deposits and advances to their amounts owed to us due to increasing sales prices per gallon 
the decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a million decrease in net earnings 
accounts receivable securitization cash flows from our accounts receivable securitization facility increased million 
we received net funding of million from this facility during fiscal as compared to million of funding contributed to this facility in the prior year period 
our strategy for obtaining liquidity at the lowest cost of capital is to initially utilize the accounts receivable securitization facility before borrowings under the operating partnership s credit facilities 
see additional discussion about the operating partnership s credit facilities in financing activities credit facilities 
our utilization of the accounts receivable securitization facility is limited by the amount of accounts receivable that we are permitted to transfer according to the facility agreement 
this arrangement allows for the proceeds of up to million from the sale of accounts receivable  depending on the available undivided interests in our accounts receivable from certain customers 
we renewed this facility effective may   for a day commitment with jpmorgan chase bank  na and fifth third bank 
at july   we had transferred million of our trade accounts receivable to the accounts receivable securitization facility with the ability to transfer  at our option  an additional million 
as our trade accounts receivable increase during the winter heating season  the securitization facility permits us to transfer additional trade accounts receivable to the facility  thereby providing additional cash for working capital needs 
this transaction is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a sale of accounts receivable and a retained interest in transferred accounts receivable in accordance with sfas the operating partnership net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the prior year period 
this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an million increase in working capital requirements and a million decrease in cash flow from operations 
the increase in working capital requirements was primarily due to million from the timing and increasing cost per gallon of inventory purchases and million from the timing and increasing sales price per gallon on accounts receivable collections 
these increases in working capital requirements were partially offset by million from the timing and increasing purchase price per gallon on accounts payable disbursements and a million increase in cash flow from the timing of customer s application of their deposits and advances to their amounts owed to us due to increasing sales prices per gallon 
the decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a million decrease in net earnings 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the prior year period 
this decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to decreased acquisition expenditure activities 
capital expenditures we incurred million in cash capital expenditures during fiscal as compared to million in the prior year period for maintenance and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition expenditures during fiscal  we used million in cash for costs associated with prior year acquisitions as compared to million in cash used in eight acquisitions in the prior year period 
financing activities during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the prior year period 
cash inflows from the net utilization of long and short term debt were million higher in the current year period compared to the prior year period 
this increase was somewhat offset by million from the issuance of common units in the prior year period that was not repeated during the current year period 
distributions ferrellgas partners paid a per unit quarterly distribution on all common units  as well as the related general partner distributions  totaling million during fiscal in connection with the distributions declared for the three months ended july   october   january  and april  the quarterly distribution on all common units and the related general partner distributions for the three months ended july  of million were paid on september  to holders of record on september  credit facilities during april  the operating partnership executed an amendment to its unsecured credit facility due april   increasing its borrowing capacity by million and bringing total borrowing capacity for all unsecured credit facilities to million

of these borrowings  million will mature on august  while the remaining million of borrowings and letters of credit will mature on april  letters of credit are currently used to cover obligations primarily relating to requirements for insurance coverage and  to a lesser extent  risk management activities and product purchases 
at july   we had million of available capacity for working capital  acquisition  capital expenditure and general partnership purposes under these unsecured credit facilities 
all borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate  which is defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus or bank of america s prime rate as of july   the federal funds rate and bank of america s prime rate were and  respectively  or the eurodollar rate plus a margin varying from to as of july   the one month and three month eurodollar rates were and  respectively 
in addition  an annual commitment fee is payable on the daily unused portion of our unsecured credit facilities at a per annum rate varying from to as of july   the commitment fee per annum rate was 
debt issuance and repayment during august  we made a scheduled principal payment of million of the series b senior notes using proceeds from borrowings on the unsecured credit facility due during august  the operating partnership made scheduled principal payments of million of the series c senior notes using proceeds from borrowings on the unsecured credit facility due during august  the operating partnership issued million in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due at an offering price equal to of par 
the proceeds from this offering were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility 
we believe that the liquidity available from our unsecured credit facilities and the accounts receivable securitization facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital expenditures working capital  debt service and letter of credit requirements for fiscal see operating activities for discussion about our accounts receivable securitization facility 
however  if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in these requirements  our needs could exceed our immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in these requirements include  but are not limited to the following a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane  a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable  increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities  increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers  a significant downgrade in our credit rating leading to decreased trade credit  or a significant acquisition 
if one or more of these or other events caused a significant use of available funding  we may consider alternatives to provide increased liquidity and capital funding 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives would be available  or  if available  could be implemented

off balance sheet financing arrangements in this section we discuss our off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
in september  we formed a qualified special purpose entity as a bankruptcy remote subsidiary and entered into a receivables facility arrangement  which we renewed in may this arrangement with a financial institution allows for the proceeds of up to million from the sale of accounts receivable  depending upon the time of year and available undivided interests in our accounts receivable from certain customers 
we believe this facility improves cash flows while serving as a source of liquidity for our operations 
see note b summary of significant accounting policies and note f accounts receivable securitization to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion about this arrangement 
our off balance sheet arrangements also include the leasing of transportation equipment  property  computer equipment and propane tanks 
we account for these arrangements as operating leases 
we believe these arrangements are a cost effective method for financing our equipment needs 
these off balance sheet arrangements enable us to lease equipment from third parties rather than  among other options  purchasing the equipment using on balance sheet financing 
most of the operating leases involving our transportation equipment contain residual value guarantees 
these transportation equipment lease arrangements are scheduled to expire over the next seven years 
most of these arrangements provide that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed a guaranteed amount  or we will be required to pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair values at the end of the lease terms have historically exceeded these guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is worthless at the end of the lease term  was million as of july  we do not know of any event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that would result in a material change to these arrangements

 earnings per share  to master limited partnerships fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an on going basis and discuss the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note b summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
we believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application depreciation of property  plant and equipment we calculate depreciation on property  plant and equipment using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment regarding assumptions about the useful life of the assets being depreciated 
when necessary  the depreciable lives are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
there were no such revisions to depreciable lives in fiscal  or residual value of customer and storage tanks we use an estimated residual value when calculating depreciation for our customer and bulk storage tanks 
customer and bulk storage tanks are classified as property  plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets 
the depreciable basis of these tanks is calculated using the original cost less the residual value 
depreciation is calculated using straight line method based on the tanks estimated useful life of years 
changes in the estimated residual value could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimates of the tanks residual value require our judgment of the value of the tanks at the end of their useful life or retirement 
when necessary  the tanks residual values are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis 
there were no such revisions to residual values in fiscal  or valuation methods  amortization methods and estimated useful lives of intangible assets the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as trademarks and trade names  customer lists and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
during fiscal we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation methods used for any acquired intangible assets 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer related and contract based assets representing the rights we own arising from the acquisition of propane distribution companies and related contractual agreements 
a customer related or contract based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity 
we believe that trademarks and trade names have an indefinite useful life due to our intention to utilize all acquired trademarks and trade names 
when necessary  the intangible assets useful lives are revised and the impact on amortization will be reflected on a prospective basis 
the determination of the fair market value of the intangible asset and the estimated useful life are based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including the use of widely accepted valuation approaches  the income approach or the cost approach  the expected use of the asset by the entity  the expected useful life of related assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  including renewal or extension periods that would not cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors and the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows 
if the underlying assumption s governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed either favorably or unfavorably  then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life 
such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time 
during fiscal  we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation method  estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets 
should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired  we may be required to reduce the carrying value and subsequent useful life of the asset 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life ie  amortization period of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
at july  and  the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was million and million  respectively 
we did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during fiscal or for additional information regarding our intangible assets  see note b summary of significant accounting policies and note g goodwill and intangible assets  net to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts we enter into commodity forward  futures  swaps and options contracts involving propane and related products to hedge exposures to product purchase price risk 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these contracts are accounted for using the fair value method 
under this valuation method  derivatives are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in value recognized in cost of product sold in the consolidated statements of earnings or in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of partners capital 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of earnings 
for further discussion of derivative commodity contracts  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note b summary of significant accounting policies and note j derivatives to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts 
unit and stock based compensation we utilize a binomial option valuation tool to compute an estimated fair value of option awards at their grant date 
this option valuation tool requires a number of inputs  some of which require an estimate to be made by management 
significant estimates include our computation of volatility  the number of groups of employees  the expected term of awards and the forfeiture rate of awards 
our stock based awards plan grants stock awards out of ferrell companies 
ferrell companies is not a publicly traded company and management does not believe it can be categorized within any certain industry group 
as a result  our volatility computation is highly subjective 
if a different volatility factor were used  it could significantly change the fair value assigned to stock based awards at their grant date 
due to the limited number of employees eligible to participate in our unit and stock based compensation plans  management believes we have only one group of employees 
if a determination were made that we have multiple groups of employees  that determination could significantly change the expected term and forfeiture rate assigned to our unit and stock based awards 
our method for computing the expected term of our unit and stock based awards utilizes historical exercise patterns 
this method could assign a term to our unit and stock based awards that is significantly different from their actual terms  which could result in a significant difference in the fair value assigned to the awards at the grant date 
we utilize historical forfeiture rates to estimate the expected forfeiture rates on our unit and stock based awards grant dates 
if actual forfeiture rates were to differ significantly from our estimates  it could result in significant differences between actual and reported compensation expense for our unit and stock based awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we did not enter into any risk management trading activities during fiscal our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
commodity price risk our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchase  storage  transport and sale of propane and are presented in our discussion of margins and are accounted for at cost 
we generally purchase propane in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short term basis 
our costs to purchase and distribute propane fluctuate with the movement of market prices 
we enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our retail customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time 
these commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment 
we employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchase  storage  transport and sale of propane 
our risk management activities include the use of forward contracts  futures  swaps and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses 
our hedging strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical product markets in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
our hedging strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy 
this policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts 
we also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk  so as to manage exposures to changing market prices 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options outstanding as of july  and  that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at million and million as of july  and  respectively 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus actual results may differ 
our sensitivity analysis includes designated hedging and the anticipated transactions associated with these hedging transactions 
these hedging transactions are anticipated to be effective  therefore  there is no effect on our sensitivity analysis from these hedging transactions 
to the extent option contracts are used as hedging instruments for anticipated transactions we have included the offsetting effect of the anticipated transactions  only to the extent the option contracts are in the money  or would become in the money as a result of the hypothetical movement in prices 
all other anticipated transactions for risk management activities have been excluded from our sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk at july  and  we had million and million  respectively  in variable rate credit facilities borrowings 
thus  assuming a one percent increase in our variable interest rate  our interest rate risk related to the borrowings on our variable rate credit facilities would result in a loss in future earnings of million for fiscal the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in interest rates may or may not equal one percent  thus actual results may differ
