item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes to the audited financial statements included in item of this report and the selected financial data included in item of this report 
the following discussion includes periods before the acquisition of amr and emcare 
accordingly  the discussion and analysis of historical periods do not fully reflect the impact the acquisition of amr and emcare have had on us 
in addition  this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section in item a of this report 
our results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
our financial statements referred to in this item are included in item of this annual report 
company overview we are a leading provider of emergency medical services in the united states 
we operate our business and market our services under the amr and emcare brands 
amr is the leading provider of medical transport services in the united states 
emcare is the leading provider of outsourced emergency department staffing and management services in the united states 
approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  was generated under exclusive contracts 
during  we provided emergency medical  ambulance and other transport services to approximately million patients in more than  communities nationwide 
american medical response over its more than years of operating history  amr has developed the largest network of ambulance transport services in the united states based on net revenue and number of transports 
amr has an share of the total ambulance services market and a share of the private provider ambulance market 
during the year ended december   amr treated and transported approximately million patients in states 
as of december   amr had approximately  contracts with communities  government agencies  healthcare providers and insurers to provide ambulance services 
for the year ended december   approximately of amr s net revenue was generated from emergency ambulance transport services 
non emergency ambulance transport services  including critical care transfer  wheelchair transports and other interfacility transports  or ifts  accounted for of amr s net revenue for the same period 
the balance of net revenue for was generated from the provision of training  dispatch centers and other services to communities and public safety agencies and from revenue associated with fixed wing medical transportation services 
emcare over its more than years of operating history  emcare has become the largest provider of outsourced emergency department staffing and related management services to healthcare facilities based on number of contracts with hospitals and affiliated physician groups 
emcare has an share of the total emergency department services market and a share of the outsourced emergency department services market 
during the year ended december   emcare had approximately million patient visits in states 
emcare primarily provides emergency department staffing and related management services to healthcare facilities 
emcare recruits and hires or subcontracts with physicians and other healthcare professionals  who then provide professional services within the healthcare facilities with which we contract 
we also provide billing and collection  risk management and other administrative services to our healthcare professionals and to independent physicians 
emcare has contracts with hospitals and independent physician groups to provide emergency department  hospitalist and radiology staffing  and related management and other administrative services 
key factors and measures we use to evaluate our business the key factors and measures we use to evaluate our business focus on the number of patients we treat and transport and the costs we incur to provide the necessary care and transportation for each of our patients 
we evaluate our revenue net of provisions for contractual payor discounts and provisions for uncompensated care 
medicaid  medicare and certain other payors receive discounts from our standard charges  which we refer to as contractual discounts 
in addition  individuals we treat and transport may be personally responsible for a deductible or co pay under their third party payor coverage  and most of our contracts require us to treat and transport patients who have no insurance or other third party payor coverage 
due to the uncertainty regarding collectibility of charges associated with services we provide to these patients  which we refer to as uncompensated care  our net revenue recognition is based on expected cash collections 
our net revenue is gross billings after provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care have increased historically primarily as a result of increases in gross billing rates 
the table below summarizes our approximate payor mix as a percentage of both net revenue and total transports and patient visits for the years ended december  and and for the eleven months ended december  percentage of net revenue percentage of total volume year ended december  year ended december  eleven months ended december  eleven months ended december  medicare medicaid commercial insurance and managed care self pay subsidies and fees total in addition to continually monitoring our payor mix  we also analyze the following measures in each of our business segments amr approximately of amr s net revenue for the year ended december  was transport revenue derived from the treatment and transportation of patients  including fixed wing medical transportation services  based on billings to third party payors  healthcare facilities and patients 
the balance of amr s net revenue is derived from direct billings to communities and government agencies for the provision of training  dispatch center and other services 
amr s measures for transport net revenue include transports 
we utilize transport data  including the number and types of transports  to evaluate net revenue and as the basis by which we measure certain costs of the business 
we segregate transports into two main categories ambulance transports including emergency  as well as non emergency  critical care and other interfacility transports and wheelchair transports due to the significant differences in reimbursement and the associated costs of providing ambulance and wheelchair transports 
as a result of these differences  in certain analyses we weight our transport numbers according to category in an effort to better measure net revenue and costs 
net revenue per transport 
net revenue per transport reflects the expected net revenue for each transport based on gross billings less all estimated provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care 
in order to better understand the trends across service lines and in our transport rates  we analyze our net revenue per transport based on weighted transports to reflect the differences in our transportation mix 
the change from period to period in the number of transports is influenced by changes in transports in existing markets from both new and existing facilities we serve for non emergency transports  and the effects of general community conditions for emergency transports 
the general community conditions may include the timing  location and severity of influenza  allergens and other annually recurring viruses  severe weather that affects a region s health status and or infrastructure and community specific demographic changes 
the costs we incur in our amr business segment consist primarily of compensation and benefits for ambulance crews and support personnel  direct and indirect operating costs to provide transportation services  and costs related to accident and insurance claims 
amr s key cost measures include unit hours and cost per unit hour 
our measurement of a unit hour is based on a fully staffed ambulance or wheelchair van for one operating hour 
we use unit hours and cost per unit hour to measure compensation related costs and the efficiency of our deployed resources 
we monitor unit hours and cost per unit hour on a combined basis  as well as on a segregated basis between ambulance and wheelchair transports 
operating costs per transport 
operating costs per transport is comprised of certain direct operating costs  including vehicle operating costs  medical supplies and other transport related costs  but excluding compensation related costs 
monitoring operating costs per transport allows us to better evaluate cost trends and operating practices of our regional and local management teams 
accident and insurance claims 
we monitor the number and magnitude of all accident and insurance claims in order to measure the effectiveness of our risk management programs 
depending on the type of claim workers compensation  auto  general or professional liability  we monitor our performance by utilizing various bases of measurement  such as net revenue  miles driven  number of vehicles operated  compensation dollars  and number of transports 
we have focused our risk mitigation efforts on employee training for proper patient handling techniques  development of clinical and medical equipment protocols  driving safety  implementation of technology to reduce auto incidents and other risk mitigation processes which we believe has resulted in a reduction in the frequency  severity and development of claims 
depreciation expense relates primarily to charges for usage of vehicles  computer hardware and software  equipment and other technologies 
amortization expense relates primarily to intangibles recorded for customer relationships 
emcare of emcare s net revenue for the year ended december   approximately was derived from our hospital contracts for emergency department staffing  hospitalist and radiology services and other management services 
of this revenue  approximately was generated from billings to third party payors and patients for patient visits and approximately was generated from billings to hospitals and affiliated physician groups for professional services 
emcare s key net revenue measures are patient visits 
we utilize patient visits to evaluate net revenue and as the basis by which we measure certain costs of the business 
number of contracts 
this reflects the number of contractual relationships we have for outsourced emergency department staffing and related management services  hospitalist services and other management services 
we analyze the change in our number of contracts from period to period based on net new contracts  which is the difference between total new contracts and contracts that have terminated 
revenue per patient visit 
this reflects the expected net revenue for each patient visit based on gross billings less all estimated provisions for contractual discounts and uncompensated care 
net revenue per patient visit also includes net revenue from billings to third party payors and hospitals 
the change from period to period in the number of patient visits under our same store contracts is influenced by general community conditions as well as hospital specific elements  many of which are beyond our direct control 
the general community conditions include the timing  location and severity of influenza  allergens and other annually recurring viruses and severe weather that affects a region s health status and or infrastructure 
hospital specific elements include the timing and extent of facility renovations  hospital staffing issues and regulations that affect patient flow through the hospital 
the costs incurred in our emcare business segment consist primarily of compensation and benefits for physicians and other professional providers  professional liability costs  and contract and other support costs 
emcare s key cost measures include provider compensation per patient visit 
provider compensation per patient visit includes all compensation and benefit costs for all professional providers  including physicians  physician assistants and nurse practitioners  during each patient visit 
providers include all full time  part time and independently contracted providers 
analyzing provider compensation per patient visit enables us to monitor our most significant cost in performing services under our contracts 
professional liability costs 
these costs include provisions for estimated losses for actual claims  and claims likely to be incurred in the period  within our self insurance limits based on our past loss experience  as well as actual direct costs  including investigation and defense costs  claims payments  reinsurance costs and other costs related to provider professional liability 
depreciation expense relates primarily to charges for usage of medical equipment  computer hardware and software  and other technologies 
amortization expense relates primarily to intangibles recorded for customer relationships 
non gaap measures adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as net income before equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary  income tax expense  loss on early debt extinguishment  interest and other income  realized gain loss on investments  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is commonly used by management and investors as a measure of leverage capacity  debt service ability and liquidity 
adjusted ebitda is not considered a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and the items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to such gaap measures as net income  cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
since adjusted ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
during the year ended december   we reclassified income earned on insurance related assets as interest income from restricted assets  such income was previously reported as a component of insurance expense 
previous amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the following tables set forth a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income for our company  and reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to income from operations for our two operating segments and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  using data derived from our financial statements for the periods indicated amounts in thousands predecessor successor year ended december  eleven months ended december  year ended december  unaudited consolidated combined adjusted ebitda     depreciation and amortization expense   interest income from restricted assets   income from operations     interest income from restricted assets    interest expense     realized gain loss on investments interest and other income     loss on debt extinguishment   equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiary income tax expense     net income     amr adjusted ebitda     depreciation and amortization expense   interest income from restricted assets   income from operations     emcare adjusted ebitda     depreciation and amortization expense   interest income from restricted assets   income from operations     year ended december  year ended december  eleven months ended december  adjusted ebitda    interest paid    change in accounts receivable    change in other operating assets liabilities   equity based compensation    other cash flows provided by operating activities   factors affecting operating results re capitalization activities on february   an investor group led by onex partners lp and onex corporation  and including members of our management  purchased our operating subsidiaries  amr and emcare  from laidlaw international  inc to fund the million purchase price of these acquisitions  we received equity contributions of million  issued and sold million principal amount of senior subordinated notes  and entered into a million senior secured credit agreement comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
we borrowed the full amount of the term loan and million under the revolving credit facility to fund our acquisition of amr and emcare  including the payment of related fees and expenses  and we have used balances outstanding from time to time under the revolving credit facility for working capital purposes 
the increase in the outstanding balance of long term debt in february resulted in a corresponding increase in interest expense 
on december   emergency medical services corporation completed its initial public offering of  shares of class a common stock  trading of those shares commenced on the new york stock exchange on december  we used a significant portion of the net proceeds of million from this initial public offering to repay million of debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility and we used the balance for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
this reduction to the outstanding balance of long term debt in december  and additional debt repayments made in of million  have resulted in a corresponding decrease in our interest costs 
rate changes by government sponsored programs in february  the health care financing administration  now renamed the centers for medicare and medicaid services  issued the medicare ambulance fee schedule final rule  or final rule  that revised medicare policy on the coverage of ambulance transport services  effective april  the final rule was the result of a mandate under the balanced budget act of  or bba  to establish a national fee schedule for payment of ambulance transport services that would control increases in expenditures under part b of the medicare program  establish definitions for ambulance transport services that link payments to the type of services furnished  consider appropriate regional and operational differences and consider adjustments to account for inflation  among other provisions 
the final rule provided for a five year phase in of a national fee schedule  beginning april  we estimate that the impact of the ambulance service rate decreases under the national fee schedule mandated under the bba  as modified by the phase in provisions of the medicare modernization act  resulted in an increase in amr s net revenue of approximately million during calendar year  resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue of approximately million in  and resulted in a decrease in amr s net revenue of approximately million in based upon the current medicare transport mix  we expect a further increase in our net revenue totaling approximately million for the period through although we have been able to substantially mitigate the phased in reductions of the bba through additional fee and subsidy increases  we may not be able to continue to do so 
medicare pays for all emcare physicians services based upon a national fee schedule 
the rate formula may result in significant yearly fluctuations which may be unrelated to changes in the actual cost of providing physician services 
changes in net new contracts our operating results are affected directly by the number of net new contracts we have in a period  reflecting the effects of both new contracts and contract expirations 
we regularly bid for new contracts  frequently in a formal competitive bidding process that often requires written responses to a request for proposal  or rfp  and  in any fiscal period  certain of our contracts will expire 
we may elect not to seek extension or renewal of a contract if we determine that we cannot do so on favorable terms 
with respect to expiring contracts we would like to renew  we may be required to seek renewal through an rfp  and we may not be successful in retaining any such contracts  or retaining them on terms that are as favorable as present terms 
hurricane katrina and our gulf coast operations amr provides ambulance services in gulfport and biloxi  mississippi and several other gulf coast communities 
although our dispatch center was damaged by hurricane katrina and we had damage to a small number of vehicles  we were able to maintain communications through our use of back up generators and other emergency supplies 
we worked closely with the federal emergency management agency  or fema  and other federal  state and local agencies and deployed additional ambulance transportation resources where they were most needed  particularly in the coastal areas of mississippi  louisiana and alabama 
for the eleven months ended december   revenue derived from additional hurricane related services was of net revenue and related expenses were of total expenses included in income from operations 
during  we recorded approximately million in additional revenue from hurricane related deployment in emcare operations generally were unaffected by katrina  with only one facility in the affected area 
emcare deployed additional resources to assist at that facility  and we experienced a volume increase in certain facilities in adjacent states where evacuees were relocated 
inflation and fuel costs certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  insurance  fuel and equipment repair and maintenance costs  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
although we have generally been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and successful negotiation of fees and subsidies  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies and fee changes 
fuel costs represented approximately of amr s operating expenses for the years ended december  and  and for the same period in increases in fuel costs  without mitigation through fee and subsidy increases  would continue to adversely affect amr s operating results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations  financial condition and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  requiring the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion is not intended to represent a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited financial statements included in item of this report 
claims liability and professional liability reserves we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims  automobile  professional liability claims and general business liabilities 
reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves are based upon independent actuarial valuations  which are updated quarterly 
reserves other than general liability reserves are discounted at a rate commensurate with the interest rate on monetary assets that essentially are risk free and have a maturity comparable to the underlying liabilities 
the actuarial valuations consider a number of factors  including historical claim payment patterns and changes in case reserves  the assumed rate of increase in healthcare costs and property damage repairs 
historical experience and recent trends in the historical experience are the most significant factors in the determination of these reserves 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these reserves provides a consistent and effective way to measure these subjective accruals 
however  given the magnitude of the claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known  the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive 
accordingly  our recorded reserves could differ from our ultimate costs related to these claims due to changes in our accident reporting  claims payment and settlement practices or claims reserve practices  as well as differences between assumed and future cost increases 
accrued unpaid claims and expenses that are expected to be paid within the next twelve months are classified as current liabilities 
all other accrued unpaid claims and expenses are classified as non current liabilities 
trade and other accounts receivable our internal billing operations have primary responsibility for billing and collecting our accounts receivable 
we utilize various processes and procedures in our collection efforts depending on the payor classification  these efforts include monthly statements  written collection notices and telephonic follow up procedures for certain accounts 
amr writes off amounts not collected through our internal collection efforts to our uncompensated care allowance  and sends these receivables to third party collection agencies for further follow up collection efforts 
to simplify the recording of any third party collection agency recoveries  emcare classifies accounts sent to third party collection agencies as delinquent within the billing system and they are written off 
accordingly  we record any subsequent collections through third party collection efforts as a recovery  in the case of amr  and record it against our delinquent status account  in the case of emcare 
as we discuss further in our revenue recognition policy below  we determine our allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care based on sophisticated information systems and financial models  including payor reimbursement schedules  historical write off experience and other economic data 
we record our patient related accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care in the period in which we perform services 
we record gross fee for service revenue and related receivables based upon established fee schedule prices 
we reduce our recorded revenue and receivables for estimated discounts to patients covered by contractual insurance arrangements  and reduce these further by our estimate of uncollectible accounts 
our provision and allowance for uncompensated care is based primarily on the historical collection and write off activity of our approximately million annual patient encounters 
we extract this data from our billing systems regularly and use it to compare our accounts receivable balances to estimated ultimate collections 
our allowance for uncompensated care is related principally to receivables we record for self pay patients and is not recorded on specific accounts due to the volume of individual patient receivables and the thousands of commercial and managed care contracts 
we also have other receivables related to facility and community subsidies and contractual receivables for providing staffing to communities for special events 
we review these other receivables periodically to determine our expected collections and whether any allowances may be necessary 
we write the balance off after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from medicare  medicaid and private insurance payors that receive discounts from our standard charges  which are referred to as contractual provisions 
additionally  we are also subject to collection risk for services provided to uninsured patients or for the deductible or co pay portion of services for insured patients  which are referred to as uncompensated care 
we record our healthcare services revenue net of estimated provisions for contractual allowances and uncompensated care 
healthcare reimbursement is complex and may involve lengthy delays 
third party payors are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for healthcare and may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  were for services provided that were not determined medically necessary  or insufficient supporting information was provided 
in addition  multiple payors with different requirements can be involved with each claim 
management utilizes sophisticated information systems and financial models to estimate the provisions for contractual allowances and uncompensated care 
the estimate for contractual allowances is determined on a payor specific basis and is predominantly based on prior collection experience  adjusted as needed for known changes in reimbursement rates and recent changes in payor mix and patient acuity factors 
the estimate for uncompensated care is based principally on historical collection rates  write off percentages and accounts receivable agings 
these estimates are analyzed continually and updated by management by monitoring reimbursement rate trends from governmental and private insurance payors  recent trends in collections from self pay patients  the ultimate cash collection patterns from all payors  accounts receivable aging trends  operating statistics and ratios  and the overall trends in accounts receivable write offs 
management also regularly analyzes the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable after certain stages of the collection cycle using a look back analysis to determine the amount of receivables subsequently collected 
retroactive adjustments  which increased revenue for and  were and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
the evaluation of these factors  as well as the interpretation of governmental regulations and private insurance contract provisions  involves complex  subjective judgments 
as a result of the inherent complexity of these calculations  our actual revenues and net income  and our accounts receivable  could vary significantly from the amounts reported 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management concludes it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
the respective tax authorities  in the normal course  audit previous tax filings 
it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these audits or establish a reasonable estimate of possible additional taxes owing  if any 
in connection with the acquisition of amr and emcare  the company made an internal revenue code irc section h election for emcare which eliminated million of deferred tax assets and stepped up the tax basis of emcare s assets to fair value 
differences between book and tax depreciation and amortization for these assets will create future deferred tax assets or liabilities 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas fin 
fin was adopted by the company on january  fin creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  prescribes the minimum recognition threshold  and provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin also has expanded disclosure requirements  which include a tabular rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits  as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
upon adoption of fin  the company reclassified approximately million to a long term liability and increased current deferred tax assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized and is required to be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if changes in circumstances  such as an adverse change to our business environment  cause us to believe that goodwill may be impaired 
goodwill is allocated at the reporting unit level 
if the fair value of the reporting unit falls below the book value of the reporting unit at an impairment assessment date  an impairment charge would be recorded 
should our business environment or other factors change  our goodwill may become impaired and may result in material charges to our income statement 
definite life intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews when evidence or triggering events suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
should such triggering events occur that cause us to review our definite life intangibles  management evaluates the carrying value in relation to the projection of future cash flows of the underlying assets 
if deemed necessary  we would take a charge to earnings for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value 
should factors affecting the value of our definite life intangibles change significantly  such as declining contract retention rates or reduced contractual cash flows  we may need to record an impairment charge in amounts that are significant to our financial statements

year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated our results for the year ended december  reflect an increase in net revenue of million and an increase in net income of million compared to the year ended december  the increase in net income is attributable primarily to an increase of million in operating income  offset by increases in income tax expense 
basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  for the year ended december  basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  for the same period in net revenue for the year ended december   we generated net revenue of  million compared to net revenue of  million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase is attributable primarily to increases in rates and volumes on existing contracts and increased volume from net new contracts and acquisitions 
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the same period in the increase is attributable primarily to the net impact of revenue growth during the period and continued improvement in insurance claims costs 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to higher depreciation expense related to growth in capital expenditures during and amortization expense recorded on additional contract intangible assets for acquisitions made since december  interest income from restricted assets interest income from restricted assets for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the increase is attributable primarily to additional insurance collateral assets maintained during the year 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the increase is attributable primarily to borrowings on our revolving credit facility during the year ended december  income tax expense income tax expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  which resulted primarily from increased operating income 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared with for the same period in amr net revenue net revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million  or  from  million for the same period in the increase in net revenue was due primarily to an increase in our net revenue per weighted transport of approximately  or million and a decrease of  or million  in weighted transport volume 
revenue per weighted transport increased due primarily to revenue from our fixed wing air transportation services business acquired in july  and from our medicaid managed transportation business in texas  a contract under which we began providing services in june weighted transports decreased approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the change was primarily the result of the restructuring of certain of our operations in los angeles and the exit of our operations located in eastern michigan  which accounted for a decrease of approximately  weighted transports 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in weighted transports of  from our acquisitions of abbott ambulance and medicwest in and by an increase in transport volume in other markets of 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit costs for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  ambulance crew wages per ambulance unit hour increased by approximately  or million  principally from annual wage rate increases 
ambulance unit hours decreased period over period by or million  due to the restructuring of certain of our operations in los angeles and the exit of our operations located in eastern michigan  partially offset by increases from recent acquisitions and in our other markets 
non crew wages increased million  or primarily from annual salary increases and additional compensation costs incurred under our fixed wing transportation services business  medicaid management transportation contract and newly acquired companies 
benefit costs decreased by million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  primarily due to reduced claims costs incurred under our self insured health plans 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  operating expenses per weighted transport increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this change is due primarily to an additional million of operating expenses incurred under our fixed wing transportation services business and our texas medicaid managed transportation contract and higher fuel costs 
insurance expense insurance expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  or of net revenue in both years 
due to continued improvement in estimates of current and prior year ultimate claims costs  a reduction of prior year insurance provisions of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to a million reduction for the same period in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to an increase in software licensing and maintenance fees 
restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were recorded during the year ended december   relating to the closure of one of our billing offices and restructuring of our operations in los angeles and orange counties in california
