item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview jaco is a distributor of active and passive electronic components to industrial oems that are used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic products in such industries as telecommunications  medical devices  computers and office equipment  military aerospace and automotive and consumer electronics 
products distributed by the company include semiconductors  flat panel displays  capacitors  resistors  electromechanical devices and power supplies 
demand for our products has remained relatively stable in recent periods  the average selling prices of many of the components we distribute  particularly semiconductor and passive components  have decreased due to global competitive pressures  which has adversely affected our operating profits 
in response  the company has implemented cost reduction initiatives to reduce expenses to levels required to support current sales and profit levels 
due to the ongoing shift of manufacturing to the far east  the company has modified its business model to pursue the business available in the united states  increase its support of global contract manufacturers that require its value added services and logistics programs  and aggressively promote its flat panel display fpd product offerings line  which experienced significant growth in fiscal  and and which the company believes has potential for growth in the future 
the company incurred net losses of approximately  and  during the years ended june  and  respectively 
included in the net loss for the year ended june   was a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  excluding such goodwill impairment charge  the company incurred a loss from continuing operations of approximately  included in net loss for the year ended june   was approximately  related to the write off of an uncollectible note receivable and other receivables  which had arisen from the sale of the contract manufacturing subsidiary 
excluding such write off  the company reported income from continuing operations of approximately critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectible amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors rendering inventories as unsaleable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent franchise agreements and non compete covenants 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of june  and reviewed its seven reporting units by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as a result of this impairment test it was determined that no impairment exists with respect to the recorded amount of goodwill for six of the reporting units 
the impairment test for the seventh reporting unit interface electronics corp 
iec indicated that the fair value of iec was less than its carrying value and as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  as a non cash charge to operating expenses 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we would record a valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the amount of future tax benefit would not be realized 
while the company still believes that it is positioned for long term growth  the volatility in our industry and markets has made it increasingly difficult to predict sales and operating results on a short term basis  and when coupled with the cumulative losses reported over the last several fiscal years  the company concluded that a full valuation allowance against the entire benefit was needed due to the uncertainty regarding the company s ability to utilize the benefit 
the valuation allowance increased by approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the shipment of finished products to our customers when title is transferred 
revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
management considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue for rebates and estimated customer returns and other allowances 
we offer rebates to certain customers based on the volume of products purchased 
our products are sold on a stand alone basis and are not part of sales arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the product is shipped as we do not have any obligations beyond shipment to our customers 
when the shipping terms are fob shipping point  revenue is recorded as the goods leave our facility 
in certain instances and to certain customers  goods are shipped with shipping terms of fob destination point 
in these instances we determine when the goods are delivered to our customer s facility and calculate whether an adjustment to defer revenue recognition is required 
if such adjustment is material  an adjustment is recorded in the financial statements 
in fiscal such adjustments were not material 
a portion of our business involves shipments directly from our suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and have risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  we recognize revenue when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
we also maintain a consignment inventory program  which provides for certain components to be shipped on site to a consignee so that such components are available for the consignee s use when they are required 
the consignee maintains a right of return related to unused parts that are shipped under the consignment inventory program 
revenue is not recognized from products shipped on consignment until notification is received from our customer that they have accepted title of the inventory that was shipped initially on consignment 
the items shipped on consignment in which title has not been accepted are included in our inventories 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model and an estimate of forfeitures 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option term assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the adoption of sfas no 
r has not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting standards effective july   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the adoption of the provisions of fin did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position and did not result in unrecognized tax benefits being recorded 
fin also provides guidance on the accounting for potential interest and penalties 
the company s historical accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties has been to classify these amounts as income taxes  and the company has continued this classification upon the adoption of fin since no unrecognized tax benefits are being recorded  no corresponding interest and penalties have been accrued 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states 
there are currently no examinations underway 
the company is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by the internal revenue service and most state and local authorities for fiscal tax years ending prior to june  certain state authorities may subject the company to examination up to the period ending june  in  september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value 
sfas no 
retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value  but clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
sfas no 
states that the transaction is hypothetical at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the asset or liability 
as such  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price  as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 

this standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities  with respect to accounting for a transfer to the trading category for all entities with available for sale and trading securities electing the fair value option 
this standard allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such  allows different applications for electing the option for a single item or groups of items  and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are accounted for differently in relation to the fair value option 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  and no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
effective for fiscal years beginning after december   these statements revise and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these statements will change the company s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis 
on december   the securities and exchange commission issued sab no 
to permit entities  under certain circumstances to continue to use the simplified method  in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
sab no 
amended sab no 
to permit the use of the simplified method beyond december  the company believes that the adoption of sab no 
will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
requires enhanced qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements although it does not anticipate that the statement will have a material impact since the company has not historically engaged in hedging activities or acquired derivative instruments 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with us gaap 
sfas no 
will become effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
this statement is not expected to change the company s current accounting practice 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing a renewal or extension assumptions used for purposes of determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is not permitted 
the company will be assessing the potential effect of fsp fas if applicable  if it enters into a business combination results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill operating income loss interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  a million  or decrease 
the decrease in net sales is attributable to a million decrease in our logistic business supporting global contract manufacturers 
we support these customers with inventory management services and warehousing capabilities 
sales to these global contract manufacturers are subject to our ability to provide the products that are required at competitive prices 
we have continued to see weak demand from these customers 
also  without direct operations in the far east  where these customers are located  we have been unable to expand our customer base to offset the decrease in net sales to our existing customers 
the resulting decline in its sales to these global contract manufacturers was a direct result in the company recording an impairment charge of approximately  as a non cash charge to operating expenses 
our primary area of focus has been on our flat panel display fpd products both as components through our standard distribution channel and as a value added product offering through our in house integration center 
we provide design capabilities and a full solution capability enabling us to offer our customers an expanded range of services to integrate fpd product into our customer s specific applications 
we market our fpd capabilities to a broad range of industries  such as electronic kiosk  the fast food industry  signage  the gaming industry  financial institutions  medical applications  military and electronic voting machines 
we previously announced that we were awarded a sizable contract to build optical scan voting machines 
during the fourth quarter we began shipping this product 
our fiscal net sales were million compared to million last fiscal year 
this represents approximately a increase compared to fiscal for fiscal our fpd sales represented approximately of our total net sales 
this is the first time that fpd product has represented the largest percentage of our net sales on an annual basis 
we continue to aggressively market our fpd product offering 
we believe we can continue to be competitive with this product and that it has the potential for continued growth 
semiconductors represented approximately of net sales for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal net sales were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
the majority of this decrease is a result of the decrease in sales through our logistic programs 
our sales domestically also decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal pricing has continued to decrease reducing our sales 
due to the historically highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  we have been subject to fluctuations in this portion of our business 
passive components which are primarily a commodity product such as capacitor and resistors accounted for million  or approximately of net sales for fiscal compared to million  or approximately of net sales for fiscal we primarily market passive components domestically 
due to manufacturing continuing to shift to the far east  we do not believe we will materially increase our net sales of passive components for the foreseeable future 
electromechanical products such as power supplies  relays and printer heads accounted for million  or approximately  of net sales for fiscal compared to million  or  of net sales for fiscal this represents an increase of approximately 
we believe we can compete domestically with this product and continue to market accordingly 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit is attributable to the decrease in net sales and corresponding gross profit of our logistics business 
our core business has historically operated at higher gross profit margins compared to our logistics business 
this accounted for the increase in our gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 
management does not anticipate any material variances in our gross profit margin based on our current mix of sales 
management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
any future changes in demand for product through our logistic programs could affect our gross profit margin 
in addition  demand and pricing for our products have been  and in the future may continue to be  affected by industry wide trends and events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal actual sg a decreased approximately million 
this represents a decrease when comparing fiscal to fiscal management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales  to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
the increase in percentage of sg a to net sales this fiscal year compared to fiscal is attributable to the decrease in net sales 
we continue to review all expenses and eliminate any expenses that will not result in a decrease in net sales 
we continue to be committed to growing sales of our fpd product 
as a result  we continue to increase our spending in this area 
we believe these investments have contributed to our increase in fpd sales 
operating loss for fiscal was million compared to an operating profit of million for fiscal as a result of its annual impairment test the company determined that an impairment existed with respect to the recorded amount of goodwill for one of its reporting units iec and as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  as a non cash charge to operating expenses 
this impairment charge and the decrease in net sales and corresponding reduction in gross profit was responsible for the decrease in operating income 
interest expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in borrowing rates 
recent reductions in federal lending rates will favorably impact interest expense for the foreseeable future 
fluctuations in our borrowings under our credit facility would impact interest expense for future periods 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal results from continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an million  or increase 
we support global contract manufacturers primarily in the far east with logistic programs 
these programs consist of inventory management services and warehousing capabilities 
sales to these customers consist almost entirely of semiconductors 
during the earlier quarters of fiscal demand was very strong for this product 
during the last two quarters we saw a weakening in demand 
net sales to these contract manufacturers were million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this represents an increase of million  or 
our global customers support the requirements of major equipment manufactures 
as a result  our logistics programs are partially dependent on the ability of these manufacturers to forecast future requirements 
the increase in sales through our logistics programs resulted in an increase in our sales of semiconductors 
semiconductor sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this represented an increase of million  or 
the increase in semiconductor sales was due to the strong demand for product through our logistic programs during the first two quarters of fiscal passive components  which are primarily commodity products such as capacitors  resistors and electromechanical components  which consist primarily of relays  printer heads  and power supplies  accounted for approximately million of sales in fiscal compared to approximately million of sales in fiscal this represents an increase of million or approximately 
we primarily sell passive components in the united states 
we sell flat panel display fpd products as component sales through our standard distribution channel and also as a value added offering through our in house integration center 
we provide design capabilities and a full solution capability enabling us to offer our customers an expanded range of services 
we market our fpd capabilities to a broad range of business segments  such as electronic kiosk  the fast food industry  signage  financial institutions  electronic voting equipment  medical  and military applications 
fiscal sales for fpd product was million compared to million for fiscal the virtually flat sales when comparing this fiscal year to last fiscal year is the result of a significant customer in the electronic voting industry not placing any orders during the last six months of this fiscal year 
fpd sales to all other customers increased this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year 
we continue to aggressively market our fpd product  while looking to focus on our other products that we believe to be competitive in the united states 
we intend to continue to market our logistics programs to global manufacturers 
in addition  we continue to seek to identify potential strategic alliances to expand our presence in the far east in response to the significant growth in manufacturing in the region 
recently  we have opened a warehouse in singapore to better service our customers in the region 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal this represents a million increase in gross profit  or 
management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand 
we have been able to increase our gross profit margins by optimizing our procurement for the logistics programs and as a result slightly increasing the gross profit margins 
we have also been able to increase our fpd gross margin by approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal these two areas resulted in the overall increase in gross profit margin this fiscal year compared to last fiscal year 
any changes in demand for product could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin in the future 
in addition  demand and pricing for our products have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industry wide trends and events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
the increase in sg a when comparing fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of variable costs  such as commissions  that are associated with the increase in gross profit dollars and additional costs that reflects our commitment to our fpd product 
operating income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this represents a million  or increase 
the increase in net sales and gross profit dollars generated the growth in operating profit 
interest expense increased million  or in fiscal to million from million in fiscal lower interest rates as a result of our new credit facility effective december  partially offset higher borrowing amounts that were required to support the increase in sales 
earnings before taxes and discontinued operations were  for fiscal compared to a loss of  for fiscal this was primarily the result of increased sales and corresponding gross profit dollars 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal it was determined that the note receivable recorded from the sale of nexus custom electronics  inc during september has become uncollectible 
therefore  we deemed it appropriate to write off approximately million as discontinued operations 
as a result  the net loss for fiscal is million compared to a net loss of million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources to provide liquidity in funding its operations  the company borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing 
on december   the company entered into a new three year credit agreement with cit group business credit  inc  which provides for a  revolving secured line of credit 
this credit facility has a maturity date of december  on january   the cit group business  inc assigned  of its interest in the credit facility to bank of america  na on march   the credit facility was amended to provide the company with a supplemental loan of  which was payable on may  the supplemental loan 
on may  the supplemental loan was amended 
the amendment provided for periodic payments to be made through july   at which time the supplemental loan was paid in full 
on july  the supplemental loan was amended again 
the amendment provides a  loan at an interest rate equal to the libor rate plus 
the loan is payable in seven quarterly installments commencing october  the company has currently made all the required installment payments for this supplemental loan 
in addition  mandatory prepayments are to be made based i on an amount equal to fifty percent of excess cash flow if any  as defined in the agreement and ii on the net proceeds of designated inventory  as defined in the agreement 
borrowings under the credit facility are based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company  as defined in the credit agreement  and are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at june   the outstanding balance on this revolving line of credit facility was   of which is borrowed under a day libor based revolver and  under the supplemental loan with an additional  available 
at june   the company had outstanding  of stand by letters of credit on behalf of certain vendors 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at june  was on the borrowings under the day libor based revolver  on the supplemental loan and prime plus on the balance of the borrowings 
under the credit agreement  the company is required to comply with one financial covenant which stipulates that in the event the company s additional borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit facility for any five consecutive days is less than  the company is required to retroactively maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined therein of to as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters 
the credit agreement also provides for a limitation on capital expenditures of  for the company s fiscal year and  for remaining fiscal years in which the credit agreement is in effect 
the credit agreement also contains other covenants and restrictions  including limitations on the company s incurrence of additional indebtedness unrelated to the credit facility  its incurrence of liens  mergers  consolidations and sales of assets by the company  investments  loans and acquisitions by the company  and the company s ability to pay cash dividends 
in addition  the credit agreement includes a subjective acceleration clause and requires the deposit of customer receipts to be directed to a blocked account and applied directly to the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
accordingly  outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement are classified as a current liability 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants contained in the credit agreement 
at june   the company had cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  as compared to cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  at june  as described above  our credit agreement requires our cash generated from operations to be applied directly to the prepayment of indebtedness under our credit facility 
for fiscal our net cash provided from operating activities was approximately  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of  million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in our accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses relating to inventory 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal as compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for fiscal net cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided is attributable to an increase in repayments made under our credit facility 
for fiscal and  our inventory turnover was times and times  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  were days  as compared to days at june  inventory turnover and average days outstanding are key ratios that management relies on to monitor our business 
based upon our present plans  including no anticipated material capital expenditures  we believe that cash flow that we expect to generate from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue  while continuing to control costs  and remaining in compliance with our bank covenants 
historically  we have  when necessary  been able to obtain amendments to our credit facilities or waivers from our lenders to satisfy instances of our non compliance with financial covenants 
while we cannot assure that any such future amendments or waivers  if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms under our existing credit facility or through other external sources 
in the event that in the future we are unable to obtain such an amendment or waiver of our non compliance with our financial covenants  the lenders under our credit facility could declare us to be in default under the facility  requiring all amounts outstanding under the facility to be immediately due and payable and or limit the company s ability to borrow additional amounts under the facility 
if we did not have sufficient available cash to pay all such amounts that become due and payable  we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing through other external sources  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  total year to years to years years line of credit capital lease operating lease total inflation and seasonality inflation and seasonality have not had a significant impact on our operations during the last two fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at a variable rate dependent upon either the prime rate  federal funds rate or the libor rate rates 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in any of the rates during the current fiscal year will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the rate will increase or decrease our interest expense under the credit facility by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our other floating rate debt is not material
