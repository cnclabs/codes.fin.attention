overview for more than years  carter s has become one of the most highly recognized and most trusted brand names in the children s apparel industry and with the acquisition of oshkosh on july   we now own the highly recognized and trusted oshkosh brand 
results of operations for fiscal and include the operations of oshkosh for the entire period 
results of operations for fiscal include the operations of oshkosh for the period from july  through december  we sell our products under our carter s and oshkosh brands in the wholesale channel  which includes nearly department store  national chain  and specialty store accounts 
additionally  as of december   we operated carter s and oshkosh retail stores located primarily in outlet and strip centers throughout the united states and sold our products in the mass channel under our child of mine brand to approximately  wal mart stores nationwide and under our just one year brand to approximately  target stores 
we also extend our brand reach by licensing our carter s  child of mine  just one year  oshkosh  and related brand names through domestic licensing arrangements  including licensing of our genuine kids from oshkosh brand to target stores nationwide 
our oshkosh b gosh brand name is also licensed through international licensing arrangements 
during fiscal  we earned approximately million in royalty income from these arrangements  including million from our oshkosh and genuine kids from oshkosh brands 
while we have made significant progress integrating the oshkosh business  our plans to grow the oshkosh brand in the wholesale and retail store channels have not met our expectations to date 
we continue to focus on our core product development and marketing disciplines  leveraging our relationships with major wholesale accounts  leveraging our infrastructure and supply chain  and improving the productivity of our oshkosh retail stores 
since the acquisition  we have reduced the number of oshkosh sub brands and have simplified the number of product offerings under our oshkosh brand 
this has allowed us to reduce product complexity  focus our efforts on essential  core products  and streamline operations 
in connection with the acquisition of oshkosh  we recorded cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired of million and an oshkosh brand tradename asset of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the continued negative trends in sales and profitability of the company s oshkosh b gosh wholesale and retail segments and re forecasted projections for such segments for the balance of fiscal  the company conducted an interim impairment assessment on the value of the intangible assets that the company recorded in connection with the acquisition 
based on this assessment  charges of approximately million for the oshkosh wholesale segment and million for the oshkosh retail segment were recorded for the impairment of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired asset 
in addition  an impairment charge of million was recorded to reflect the impairment of the value ascribed to the oshkosh tradename 
the carrying value of the oshkosh tradename asset is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year or more frequently if deemed necessary due to any significant events or changes in circumstances 
estimated future cash flows used in such impairment reviews could be negatively impacted if we do not achieve our sales plans  planned cost savings  and other assumptions that support the carrying value of these intangible assets  which could result in potential impairment of such assets 
we have also acquired certain definite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of oshkosh comprised of licensing agreements and leasehold interests which resulted in annual amortization expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal amortization expense related to these intangible assets will be million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal during fiscal  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program  pursuant to which the company is authorized to purchase up to million of its outstanding common shares 
such repurchases may occur from time to time in the open market  in negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
this program has no time limit 
the timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by management  based on its evaluation of market conditions  share price  and other factors 
during fiscal  the company repurchased and retired  shares  or approximately million  of its common stock at an average price of per share

interest is payable at the end of interest rate reset periods  which vary in length  but in no case exceed months for libor rate loans and quarterly for prime rate loans 
the effective interest rate on variable rate term loan borrowings as of december  and december  was and 
the senior credit facility contains financial covenants  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio  and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the senior credit facility also sets forth mandatory and optional prepayment conditions  including an annual excess cash flow requirement  as defined  that may result in our use of cash to reduce our debt obligations 
there was no excess cash flow payment required for fiscal or our obligations under the senior credit facility are collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including the assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates

during fiscal  the company closed its white house  tennessee distribution center  which was utilized to distribute the company s oshkosh brand products 
as a result of this closure  we recorded costs in fiscal of million  consisting of asset impairment charges of million related to a write down of the related land  building and equipment  million of severance charges  million of accelerated depreciation included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and million of other closure costs 
the estimated annual savings resulting from the closure of this facility are approximately million 
as of december   there are no significant remaining cash payments to be made as a result of this closure 
the estimated value of the white house assets as of december  was million 
these assets are classified as assets held for sale on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the acquisition  management developed an integration plan that includes severance  certain facility and store closures  and contract terminations 
the following liabilities  included in other current liabilities in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets  were established at the closing of the acquisition  will be funded by cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolver  and are expected to be paid in fiscal dollars in thousands severance other exit costs lease termination costs contract termination costs total balance at december  payments adjustments to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired balance at december  payments adjustments to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired balance at december  the following table summarizes as of december   the maturity or expiration dates of mandatory contractual obligations and commitments for the following fiscal years dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt interest on debt variable rate a operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements total financial obligations letters of credit purchase obligations b total financial obligations and commitments a reflects estimated variable rate interest on obligations outstanding on our term loan as of december  using an interest rate of rate in effect at december

the purchase obligations category above relates to commitments for inventory purchases

in addition to the total contractual obligations and commitments in the table above  we have post retirement benefit obligations and reserves for uncertain tax positions  included in other current and other long term liabilities as further described in note and note  respectively  to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash  together with amounts available under our revolver  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal amount of amounts outstanding under our revolver on or before july  and amounts outstanding under our term loan on or before july  effects of inflation and deflation we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through purchasing product from our global suppliers  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material 
in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices 
while we have been successful in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs with the expansion of our global sourcing network  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions from our global suppliers  our profitability may be affected 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability  with generally lower sales and gross profit in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 
over the past five fiscal years  excluding the impact of the acquisition in fiscal  approximately of our consolidated net sales were generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each fiscal year 
during these peak periods we have historically borrowed under our revolver 
in fiscal  we had million in peak borrowings under our revolver 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those policies that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and mass channel revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes  when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale and mass channel customers in order to assist these customers with inventory clearance or promotions 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales and are recorded based upon historical trends and annual forecasts 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
our credit and collections department reviews all other balances regularly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we contract with a third party service to provide us with the fair value of cooperative advertising arrangements entered into with certain of our major wholesale and mass channel customers 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller  we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses on the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
amounts determined to be in excess of the fair value of these arrangements are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and tradename as of december   we had approximately million in carter s cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and carter s and oshkosh tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s tradename was estimated at the acquisition to be approximately million using a discounted cash flow analysis  which examined the hypothetical cost savings that accrue as a result of our ownership of the tradename 
the fair value of the oshkosh tradename was recently estimated to be approximately million  also using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flows  which incorporated both historical and projected financial performance  were discounted using a discount rate of for carter s and for oshkosh 
the tradenames were determined to have indefinite lives 
the carrying value of these assets is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our offered products and the development of new products 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for workers compensation  incentive compensation  health insurance  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting dates 
for those uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  associated interest is also recognized 
we also assess permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation arrangements the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method of transition 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the following volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
the company uses actual monthly historical changes in the market value of our stock since the company s initial public offering on october   supplemented by peer company data for periods prior to our initial public offering covering the expected life of options being valued 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury rate as of the grant date having a term equal to the expected term of the option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected term this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience and estimated future exercise behavior 
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
an increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense 
dividend yield the company does not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeitures the company estimates forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
the company accounts for its performance based awards in accordance with sfas r and records stock based compensation expense over the vesting term of the awards that are expected to vest based on whether it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved 
the company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance criteria and adjusts stock based compensation expense based on its probability assessment 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
in february  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  which delays the effective date of sfas  fair value measurements  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities would include all assets and liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in paragraph of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this fasb staff position defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp no 
fas we have evaluated the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements and have determined that it will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  which provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  the company has evaluated the impact that sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements and have determined that it will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas r retains the underlying concepts of sfas in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting but sfas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas r would also apply the provisions of sfas r 
early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that sfas r may have on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency and interest rate risks in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures  including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in the far east and south and central america 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net loss income in future years 
in order to manage this risk  we source products from approximately vendors worldwide  providing us with flexibility in our production should significant fluctuations occur between the united states dollar and various local currencies 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding debt aggregated approximately million  of which million bore interest at a variable rate 
an increase or decrease of in the applicable rate would increase or decrease our annual interest cost by million  exclusive of variable rate debt subject to our swap and collar agreements  and could have an adverse effect on our net loss income and cash flow 
other risks we enter into various purchase order commitments with full package suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation 
as we rely exclusively on our full package global sourcing network  we could incur more of these termination charges  which could increase our cost of goods sold and have a material impact on our business
