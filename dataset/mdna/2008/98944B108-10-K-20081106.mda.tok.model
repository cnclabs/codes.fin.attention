item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  information technology  and other initiatives 
these initiatives are primarily designed to make us more efficient in the sales  manufacture  and distribution of our products 
these initiatives are often complex  and a failure to implement them properly may  in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits  result in an interruption to our sales  manufacturing  logistics  customer service  or accounting functions 
furthermore  we have invested a significant amount of capital into a number of these initiatives  which might have been more efficiently used if the full cost savings or benefits are not realized 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results including the requirement to reduce the book value of some assets 
we may pursue future growth through strategic acquisitions from which we may not receive the benefits that we anticipate 
we may endeavor to expand and improve our business through strategic acquisitions 
we will gain from such activity only to the extent that we can effectively leverage the assets  including personnel  and operating processes of the acquired businesses 
uncertainty is inherent within the acquisition process  and unforeseen circumstances arising from future acquisitions could offset our anticipated benefits 
any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations  including our ability to generate positive operating cash flows 
we are subject to risks related to our operations outside the united states 
we have operations outside the united states 
net sales outside the united states represented approximately of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended august  furthermore  as of august   approximately of our products were manufactured outside the united states 
in addition to the risks that are common to both our us and us operations  we face risks related to our foreign operations such as foreign currency fluctuations  unstable political  economic  financial  and market conditions  trade restrictions  
table of contents 
index to financial statements increases in tariffs and taxes  high levels of inflation  restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the united states  greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles  higher social and legal costs  and interpretation of foreign laws and regulations 
some of these risks have affected our business in the past and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows in the future 
our results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve 
economic downturns  and in particular downturns that affect the transportation  food processing and service  manufacturing  government and housekeeping markets  can adversely impact our end users 
during such downturns  these end users typically reduce their volume of purchases of cleaning products  which would likely  in turn  have an adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in the future we may expand our operations by developing new or complementary products and continuing to expand our sales and marketing and customer service organizations 
we intend to continue exploring alternative channels of distribution for our products  which could conflict with our current methods of distribution and our commission based compensation structure for our sales representatives 
in addition  we have imposed minimum performance expectations with respect to our industrial and institutional sales force  terminating the employment of those who fail to satisfy these standards 
these changes may harm our relationship with our sales force and lead to increased turnover of our sales representatives 
if we are unable to effectively implement these plans  to manage the turnover of customer accounts associated with departing sales representatives and to otherwise manage our expanding operations  we may not be able to execute our business strategy and our operating results could significantly decrease 
if we are unable to keep and protect our intellectual property rights  our ability to compete may be negatively impacted 
the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our brand names 
we own  or have licenses to use  all of the material trademark and trade name rights used by us in connection with the packaging  marketing  and distribution of our major products both in the united states and in other countries where our products are principally sold 
in addition  we possess trade secret product formulations and other product information  some of which are patented  which are competitively sensitive 
intellectual property protection is important to our business 
although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate  we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the costs required to protect our intellectual property rights may be substantial 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert our intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated  circumvented  or challenged 
other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brand names in the marketplace 
any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a diversion of our time and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise 
finally  others may claim that our business or products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
any failure by us to protect our trademarks and trade names  or any adverse judgment with respect to infringement of others intellectual property rights  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our business could suffer in the event of a work stoppage or increased organized labor activity 
as of august   approximately of our  employees were members of eight unions in the united states and europe 
while we consider our relations with employees to be generally good  we cannot assure you that we will not experience work stoppages  strikes  or slowdowns in the future 
a prolonged work stoppage  strike  or slowdown could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that  upon expiration of any of our existing collective bargaining agreements  new agreements will be reached without union action or that any new agreement will be on terms satisfactory to us 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our non union facilities will not become subject to labor union organizing efforts 
if any current non union facilities were to unionize  we would incur increased risk of work stoppages and possibly higher labor costs 
we have incurred indebtedness in the normal course of business  which subjects us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a million revolving credit facility that will mature in upon the consummation of the spin off we borrowed million under this facility  all of which was distributed to acuity brands in connection with the spin off 
in addition  we are responsible for million in industrial revenue bonds due in these financing arrangements contain customary restrictions  covenants  and events of default 
the terms of these financing arrangements impose and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities 
access to capital markets necessary to support current operations and future growth plans may not be available 
as of august   we had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million 
we entered into four interest rate swap arrangements during the fourth quarter of fiscal effectively swapping the variable interest rate associated with million of borrowings made under our revolving credit facility for fixed rates ranging from to 
we do not rely on commercial paper issuances to finance our business  and reduced our debt  net of cash  position approximately during fiscal to million 
while our million  one year credit and security agreement was allowed to expire in the normal course in october  we did not utilize this facility during its term and do not believe the borrowing capacity it previously afforded is integral to the funding of our operations 
based on our current cash on hand  current financing arrangements  and current projections of cash flow from operations  management believes that we will be able to meet the liquidity needs of our current business over the next twelve months 
however  current economic conditions have significantly constrained the ability to borrow money and substantially increased the associated costs of accessing capital markets  which could impact future profitability 
while we have relationships with six banks in our revolving credit facility  the failure of any one or more of those banks or other financial institutions may impact the company s ability to borrow money to finance its operating activities

growing public and political attention has been placed on protecting critical infrastructure  including the chemical industry  from security threats 
terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concern regarding the security of chemical production and distribution 
in addition  local  state  and federal governments have enacted  and may in the future enact  increasingly stringent regulations that impact the security of chemical plant locations  the transportation of hazardous chemicals  and the environmental impact of chemical production  which could result in higher operating costs and interruptions in normal business operations 
the market price for our common stock may be volatile  and you may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future for many reasons  including for reasons unrelated to our performance  such as reports by industry analysts  investor perceptions  or negative announcements by our customers  competitors  or suppliers regarding their own performance  as well as general economic and industry conditions 
additional factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall include but are not limited to the following variations in our quarterly results  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new products or services or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors  recruitment or departure of key personnel or key groups of personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  the disruption of supply and or price of key raw materials  significant changes in regulatory requirements  increased litigation resulting from product or employee claims  adverse developments concerning environmental matters  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our stock  and market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers  and the economy as a whole

index to financial statements risks related to our spin off from acuity brands we have a limited operating history as an independent public company and may be unable to operate as profitably a stand alone company as we operated as a segment of acuity brands 
we have only operated as an independent public company since october  prior to the distribution  the businesses that comprised each of acuity brands and zep were under one ultimate parent  and each of those businesses was able to rely  to some degree  on the earnings  assets  and cash flows of the others for capital requirements 
after the spin off  we are able to rely only on the specialty chemicals business for such requirements 
while the specialty chemicals business was a profitable segment of acuity brands  we cannot assure you that  as an independent company  profits will continue at the same level 
historical financial information may be of limited relevance 
the historical financial information preceding the distribution and included in this annual report on form k does not reflect our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows in the future and only estimates our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows had we operated as a separate stand alone public entity during the periods presented 
the financial information included herein does not reflect any changes that may have occurred or may occur in our funding and operations as a result of the spin off 
failure of the spin off to qualify as a tax free transaction could result in substantial liability 
acuity brands has received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that  among other things  the spin off including certain related transactions qualifies as tax free to acuity brands  us  and acuity brands stockholders for united states federal income tax purposes under section and related provisions of the internal revenue code 
although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the internal revenue service  if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect  then acuity brands will not be able to rely on the ruling 
moreover  the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution of shares satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax free treatment under section of the internal revenue code 
rather  the private letter ruling is based upon representations by acuity brands that those requirements have been satisfied  and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling 
acuity brands and zep inc have received an opinion of king spalding llp  counsel to acuity brands and us  to the effect that  with respect to the requirements referred to above on which the internal revenue service will not rule  those requirements will be satisfied 
the opinion is based on  among other things  certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by acuity brands and us which  if untrue or incomplete in any material respect  could jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion 
the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts  and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 
if the spin off fails to qualify for tax free treatment  a substantial corporate tax would be payable by acuity brands  measured by the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the shares of our common stock on the date of the spin off and acuity brands adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock on the date of the spin off 
the corporate level tax would be payable by acuity brands 
however  we have agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify acuity brands for this tax liability 
this indemnification obligation  if triggered  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  under the applicable treasury regulations  each member of acuity brands consolidated group at the time of the spin off including us is severally liable for such tax liability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements even if the spin off otherwise qualifies as tax free  acuity brands nevertheless could incur a substantial corporate tax liability under section e of the internal revenue code  if percent or more of our stock or the stock of acuity brands were to be acquired as part of a plan or a series of related transactions that includes the distribution 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of the stock of acuity brands or of our stock that occur within two years before or after the spin off are presumed to be part of such a plan  although acuity brands may be able to rebut that presumption 
if such an acquisition of the stock of acuity brands or of our stock triggers the application of section e  acuity brands would recognize taxable gain as described above  but the spin off would generally remain tax free to the acuity brands stockholders 
if acquisitions of our stock trigger the application of section e  we would be obligated to indemnify acuity brands for the resulting corporate level tax liability 
this indemnification obligation would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and rights plan and the tax disaffiliation agreement may discourage takeovers 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain anti takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive or that may discourage a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our board of directors 
in particular  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws classify our board of directors into three groups  so that stockholders elect only one third of the board each year  permit stockholders to remove directors only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least of our voting shares  permit a special stockholders meeting to be called only by a majority of the board of directors  do not permit stockholders to take action except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders  require stockholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders meeting  permit our board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as the board may determine  require the vote of the holders of at least of our voting shares for stockholder amendments to our bylaws  and require  for the approval of a business combination with stockholders owning or more of our voting shares  the vote of at least of our voting shares not owned by such stockholder  unless certain fair price requirements are met or the business combination is approved by our continuing directors 
the preferred stock purchase rights attached to our shares of common stock  in effect  prevent a person or group from acquiring more than of the total number of our common stock outstanding at any time after the spin off without approval from our board of directors 
in addition  delaware law generally restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our common stock  unless the transaction or the acquisition is approved in advance by our board of directors 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  and the preferred stock purchase rights could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  even though a majority of our stockholders may consider such proposals  if effected  desirable 
such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements replace the members of our board of directors 
moreover  these provisions could diminish the opportunities for stockholders to participate in certain tender offers  including tender offers at prices above the then current market value of our common stock  and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts or speculation 
if the spin off is considered part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which or more of our stock is acquired  the spin off will be taxable to acuity brands but not to its stockholders under section e of the internal revenue code 
for this purpose  any acquisitions of our stock that occur within two years after the spin off subject to certain exceptions including an exception for public trading will be presumed to be part of such a plan  although acuity brands may be able to rebut that presumption 
under the tax disaffiliation agreement  we have agreed to indemnify acuity brands for any tax liability to acuity brands under section e of the code that results from acquisitions of our stock 
this provision of the tax disaffiliation agreement may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition of our company or a disposition of our business

item legal proceedings legal proceedings we are subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business 
we are self insured up to specified limits for certain types of claims  including product liability  and are fully self insured for certain other types of claims  including environmental  product recall  and patent infringement as part of the distribution agreement with acuity brands 
based on information currently available  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
however  in the event of unexpected future developments  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters  if unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows in future periods 
we establish reserves for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for such claims 
however  we cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts reserved

index to financial statements environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  transportation  and disposal of hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes  as well as to the remediation of contaminated sites 
permits and environmental controls are required for certain of our operations to limit air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation by issuing authorities 
we will incur capital and operating costs relating to environmental compliance on an ongoing basis 
environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years  and the cost of responding to future changes may be substantial 
while we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs to remediate violations of such laws and regulations  particularly in connection with acquisitions of existing operating facilities  or to comply with changes in  or stricter or different interpretations of  existing laws and regulations 
such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in june  we reached a final resolution of the investigation by the united states department of justice the doj of certain environmental issues at our primary manufacturing facility  located in atlanta  georgia 
in connection with this resolution we are subject to a three year probation period that incorporates a compliance agreement with the united states environmental protection agency the epa 
under the compliance agreement  we are required to maintain an enhanced compliance program 
the resolution of this matter is not expected to lead to a material loss of business  any disruption of production  or materially higher operating costs 
however  in the event of our material breach of the compliance agreement  those consequences could occur 
we are currently a party to federal and state administrative proceedings arising under federal and state laws enacted for the protection of the environment where a state or federal agency or a private party alleges that hazardous substances generated by zep have been discharged into the environment and a state or federal agency is requiring a cleanup of soil and or groundwater pursuant to federal or state superfund laws 
in each of these proceedings in which zep has been named as a party that allegedly generated hazardous substances that were transported to a waste site owned and operated by another party  zep is one of many other identified generators who have reached an agreement on the allocation of costs for cleanup among the various generators and zep s potential liability is not material  or zep has been identified as a potential generator and the sites have been remediated by the epa or by a state for a cost that is not material  or other generators have cleaned up the site and have not pursued a claim against zep and zep s liability  if any  would not be material 
with respect to the only active site involving property which we own and where we have been named as a potentially responsible party our property on seaboard industrial boulevard in atlanta  georgia we and the current and former owners of adjoining properties had reached agreement to share the expected costs and responsibilities of implementing an approved corrective action plan  submitted in  under the georgia hazardous response act hsra to periodically monitor property along a nearby stream for a period of five years ending in subsequently  in connection with the doj investigation described earlier  we and the epa each analyzed samples taken from certain sumps at the seaboard facility 
the sample results from some of the sump tests indicated the presence of certain hazardous substances 
as a result  we notified the georgia environmental protection division the epd and conducted additional soil and groundwater studies pursuant to hsra 
we have submitted a corrective action plan to address the subsurface contamination north of seaboard industrial boulevard  and we are currently discussing a proposed consent order with the epd regarding our remediation efforts 
we are conducting voluntary subsurface remediation of the seaboard site 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in january  the epa issued a notice of violation and document request regarding the use and management of certain trench drains at the seaboard production facility as well as assorted minor waste labeling issues 
we responded to the request and are in discussions with the epa and epd to resolve this matter 
in may  we accrued a pretax liability of million representing our best estimate of costs associated with voluntary sub surface remediation  primarily to remove contaminants from soil underlying one of our manufacturing facilities  and other related environmental issues 
while over approximately the next four years we could expend an amount ranging up to million on these efforts  our best estimate of voluntary remediation costs continues to be million 
to date we have expended approximately million of the million reserve established in may further sampling  engineering studies  changes in regulatory requirements and or final resolution of the proposed consent order could cause us to revise the current estimate 
we believe that additional expenditures after four years of remediation may be necessary and that those expenditures  based on currently available information  could range up to an additional million during the subsequent twenty five year period 
it may be appropriate to capitalize certain of the expenditures that might be incurred in this twenty five year period 
we arrived at the current estimates on the basis of studies prepared by independent third party environmental consulting firms 
the actual cost of remediation will vary depending upon the results of additional testing and geological studies  the success of initial remediation efforts in the first five years addressing the most significant areas of contamination  the rate at which site conditions may change  and the requirements of the epd
