fiscal net sales are comprised of an approximately million direct selling business  an approximately million catalog internet business and an approximately million wholesale business 
sales and earnings growth differ in each segment depending on geographic location  market penetration  our relative market share and product and marketing execution  among other business factors 
over the long term  all three segments should experience single digit growth  most likely within the low to mid single digit range  again depending on the business factors previously noted 
our current focus is driving sales growth of our brands so we may more fully leverage our infrastructure 
new product development continues to be critical to all three segments of our business

the net assets were sold for million  inclusive of proceeds from the sale of overstock inventory of million 
of this amount  million was received at closing and a total of million was received subsequently in fiscal the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of million  which is recorded in administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings loss 
sales within the bhi na business declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of this sale 
segments within the direct selling segment  we design  manufacture or source  market and distribute an extensive line of products including scented candles  candle related accessories  fragranced bath gels  body lotions and other fragranced products under the partylite brand

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales and the percentage increase or decrease of certain items included in our consolidated statements of earnings loss percentage increase decrease from prior period percentage of net sales years ended january fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling administrative operating profit n m n m earnings from continuing operations n m n m n m percent change from the prior year would not be meaningful in concluding on our performance 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased million  or approximately  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the decrease is a result of lower mass candle sales due to the sale of bhi na mass channel candle business in our wholesale segment and a decrease in partylite s us sales 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales within both partylite s european and canadian operations and the catalog internet segment 
net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to prior year 
management believes this sales decrease was driven by a decline in the number of sales consultants as a result of increased channel competition  as well as fewer shows per consultant 
partylite canada reported an approximately increase versus the prior year in us dollars  or on a local currency basis 
sales in canada increased due to a higher number of guests per show and shows per consultant 
in partylite s european markets  sales increased approximately in us dollars  driven by strong sales in the newer markets and favorable foreign currency translation 
on a local currency basis  partylite europe sales increased approximately 
partylite europe represented approximately of partylite s worldwide net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales in the direct selling segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales catalog internet segment net sales in the catalog internet segment increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due to increased sales in our miles kimball and easy comforts catalogs and sales growth in boca java 
net sales in the catalog internet segment accounted for approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal net sales wholesale segment net sales in the wholesale segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is a result of lower mass candle sales due to the sale of the bhi na business  as well as reduced sales in our home d cor channel  which was adversely impacted by the weak housing market 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in sales for the sterno business of approximately and in the seasonal d cor business of 
net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal blyth s consolidated gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the gross profit margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase from prior year is principally due to improved margin within the partylite businesses and the sale of bhi na  which had lower profit margins than blyth s overall total  and is partially offset by continued higher commodity costs in all businesses 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense relates to the reduced sales in the us direct selling segment and the reduced sales due to the sale of bhi na  along with better cost management in many business units 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in selling expense as a percent of sales is primarily a result of sales decreasing at a greater rate than selling expenses 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to severance charges and an impairment of a lease and other fixed asset impairments related to the sale of bhi na  partially offset in fiscal and by million and million  respectively  of collections of notes receivable which had previously been reserved for as part of the gies sale 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately for fiscal and for fiscal impairment charges for goodwill of million were recognized in the wholesale segment in fiscal impairment charges of million for goodwill and other intangibles were recognized in the catalog internet segment in fiscal the amount recorded in fiscal was the result of our decision to discontinue the sales of a new sterno product  rising commodity costs and a continued decline in operating performance in the sterno reporting unit  and a business restructuring which resulted in a significantly changed near term outlook of the business in the wholesale premium reporting unit 
in fiscal  as part of our annual impairment review  we assessed the recent performance of the miles kimball business and its fiscal outlook 
the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth than anticipated and reduced operating margins due to higher postage  paper and printing costs 
this shortfall was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the catalog internet business environment and an overall weak economic climate 
as a result  the goodwill and intangibles in the catalog internet segment was determined to be impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million in fiscal blyth s consolidated operating profit increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher profits within the direct selling segment  in particular for partylite europe and canada  and reduced operating losses within the wholesale segment 
operating profit loss direct selling segment operating profit in the direct selling segment increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the impact of increased sales within partylite europe and canada  including the effects of stronger foreign currencies  partially offset by reduced sales for partylite us and continued cost increases for wax and other commodities 
operating profit loss catalog internet segment operating loss in the catalog internet segment increased by million  from a profit of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this profit decline was primarily due to the impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets of million related to the miles kimball business unit  higher postage  paper and printing costs within the miles kimball business and an increase in selling expense of million at boca java  primarily related to sales promotions 
operating profit loss wholesale segment operating loss in the wholesale segment decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in the loss for fiscal was the previously mentioned goodwill impairment charge of million 
also contributing to the improvement for fiscal was increased operating profit at sterno and midwest of cannon falls businesses  totaling million 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt 
interest income increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  mainly due to higher amounts of cash and short term investments held during fiscal foreign exchange and other reported income of million in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the loss of million in fiscal includes a million impairment charge related to an available for sale equity investment in redenvelope  inc  whose decline in value was deemed other than temporary  and a million impairment charge on an australian joint venture investment accounted for under the equity method 
partially offsetting these charges in fiscal were foreign exchange gains and other income of million 
additional impairment charges may be required to write off all or a portion of the redenvelope investment of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in profit before tax and the increase in our tax reserves for ongoing tax audits 
this increase was partially offset by continued strong foreign sourced earnings  which are taxed at a lower rate than u 
s earnings 
the offsets led to a slight decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  earnings from continuing operations increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal basic earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for fiscal was million  or per diluted share

the loss from discontinued operations includes an operating loss  net of tax  of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal there were no discontinued operations during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased million  or approximately  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the decrease is a result of the sale of impact plastics in january  a decrease in partylite s us sales and lower mass candle sales in our wholesale business 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales within partylite s european operations and the catalog internet segment as well as increased sales in our seasonal  home d cor and sterno wholesale businesses 
net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to prior year 
management believes this sales decrease was driven by a decline in the number of sales consultants as a result of increased channel competition  as well as fewer shows per consultant 
additionally  fiscal sales benefited from the reversal of a contingent reserve in the amount of million for a settlement of an unclaimed property matter associated with gift cards sold since the inception of the gift card program in the direct selling business 
partylite canada reported an approximately increase versus the prior year in us dollars 
sales in canada increased due to a higher number of guests per show and shows per consultant  partially offset by a decrease in the number of consultants

net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal blyth s consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease from prior year is principally due to lower partylite us sales  restructuring charges of million in the wholesale segment and million in the direct selling segment  and higher commodity costs 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense relates to the reduced sales in the us direct selling and mass candle businesses  along with tighter cost controls in many business units  partially offset by restructuring charges in the wholesale and direct selling segment 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in selling expense as a percent of sales is a result of sales decreasing at a greater rate than selling expenses 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in administrative expenses versus the prior year was primarily due to non recurring expenses related to the proposed spin off of the wholesale segment which was not completed and the loss on sale of impact plastics of million included in fiscal additionally  in fiscal we collected million for a note receivable which had been reserved for as part of the gies sale 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately for both fiscal and fiscal goodwill impairment charges of million and million were recognized in the wholesale segment in fiscal and  respectively 
the charge in fiscal was the result of a substantial decline in the operating performance of the reporting units when compared to prior years results and budgeted expectations 
the amount recorded in fiscal was the result of our decision to discontinue the sales of a new product  rising commodity costs and a continued decline in operating performance in the sterno reporting unit  and a business restructuring resulted in a significantly changed near term outlook of the business in the wholesale premium reporting unit 
the charges incurred in fiscal included the write off of the remaining goodwill balances within the wholesale segment see critical accounting policies and note of the consolidated financial statements

interest income and other increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher amounts of cash and short term investments 
income tax expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in us earnings versus higher foreign sourced earnings  which are taxed at a lower rate than u 
s earnings and the income tax expense of million recorded in fiscal related to the american jobs creations act of ajca dividend which did not recur in fiscal this decrease was offset by the recording of income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings  the tax impact of non deductible goodwill impairments  and an increase in our contingent tax reserve 
these offsets led to an increase in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  earnings from continuing operations decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal basic earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to for fiscal diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for fiscal was million  or per diluted share

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  restructuring and impairments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included in this report  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers  net of returns and allowances 
we recognize revenue upon delivery  when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities 
generally  sales orders are received via signed customer purchase orders with stated fixed prices based on published price lists 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
should market conditions decline  we may increase customer incentives with respect to future sales 
we also record reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for estimated customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damage in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
in some instances  we receive payment in advance of product delivery 
such advance payments occur primarily in our direct selling and direct marketing channels and are recorded as deferred revenue 
upon delivery of product for which advance payment has been made  the related deferred revenue is reclassified to revenue 
most of our sales made on credit are made to an established list of customers 
although the collectability of sales made on credit is reasonably assured  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts for trade and note receivables 
the allowance is determined based on our evaluation of specific customers ability to pay  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
while we believe we have appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  our customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to us  could be adversely affected by declining sales at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
some of our business units offer seasonal dating programs pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms for seasonal product shipments 
as with other customers  customer orders pursuant to such seasonal dating programs are generally received in the form of a written purchase order signed by an authorized representative of the customer 
sales made pursuant to seasonal dating programs are recorded as revenue only upon delivery either to the customer or to an agent of the customer depending on the freight terms for the particular shipment and consistent with the concept of risk of loss 
the sales price for our products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs is fixed prior to the time of shipment to the customer 
customers do not have the right to return product  except for rights to return that we believe are typical of our industry for such reasons as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
we are not required to repurchase products from our customers  nor do we have any regular practice of doing so 
we believe that we are reasonably assured of payment for products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs based on our historical experience with the established list of customers eligible for such programs 
in addition  we minimize our exposure to bad debts by utilizing established credit limits for each customer 
if  however  product sales by our customers during the seasonal selling period should fall significantly below expectations  such customers financial condition could be adversely affected  increasing the risk of not collecting these seasonal dating receivables and  possibly  resulting in additional bad debt charges 
we do not make any sales under consignment or similar arrangements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete  excess and unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
if market acceptance of our existing products or the successful introduction of new products should significantly decrease  additional inventory write downs could be required 
potential additional inventory write downs could result from unanticipated additional quantities of obsolete finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
as of january  and  we had inventory valuation reserves totaling million and million  respectively 
restructuring and impairment charges on long lived assets in response to changing market conditions and competition  our management regularly updates our business model and market strategies  including the evaluation of facilities  personnel and products 
future adverse changes in economic and market conditions could result in additional organizational changes and possibly additional restructuring and impairment charges 
we recorded million and million of charges related to the restructuring of our north american mass channel home fragrance business during fiscal and fiscal  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
also  during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded million and million  respectively  of charges related to the restructuring of the north american operations of our direct selling segment in recognition of the recent decline in sales in this channel 
the fiscal costs were comprised of a million charge to cost of goods sold for lease obligations and million of severance costs recorded in selling and administrative expense 
historically  we have reviewed long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such an asset might not be recoverable 
management determines whether there has been a permanent impairment on long lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which may be estimated using the present value of the same cash flows 
long lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test and such other intangibles are also subject to impairment reviews  which must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired 
we perform our annual assessment of impairment as of january  which is our fiscal year end date 
for goodwill  the first step is to identify whether a potential impairment exists 
this first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value for each of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the fair value of the reporting units is derived by calculating the average of the outcome of the two valuation techniques 
the discounted cash flow methodology assumes the fair value of an asset can be estimated by the economic benefit or net cash flows the asset will generate over the life of the asset  discounted to its present value 
the discounting process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and the investment risk factors 
the market multiple methodology estimates fair value based on what other participants in the market have recently paid for reasonably similar assets 
adjustments are made to compensate for differences between the reasonably similar assets and the assets being valued 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the estimated fair value of the goodwill 
if fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense 
our assumptions in the discounted cash flow methodology used to support recoverability include the reporting unit s five year business outlook 
the business outlook is a five year projection of the business unit s financial performance 
the business outlook includes the cash expected to be generated from the reporting unit based on certain assumptions for revenue growth  capital spending and profit margins 
this serves as the basis for the discounted cash flow model in determining fair value 
additionally  the discount rate utilized in the cash flow model values the reporting unit to its net present value taking into consideration the time value of money  other investment risk factors and the terminal value of the business 
for the terminal value  we used a multiple of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by a certain factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates  among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business  which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
the following circumstances could impact our cash flow and cause further impairments to reported goodwill unexpected increase in competition resulting in lower prices or lower volumes  entry of new products into the marketplace from competitors  lack of acceptance of our new products into the marketplace  loss of a key employee or customer  significantly higher raw material costs  and macro economic factors 
wholesale premium during the second quarter of fiscal  we identified a triggering event that caused us to reassess goodwill impairment for our wholesale premium reporting unit within the wholesale segment 
in the wholesale premium reporting unit  a business restructuring resulted in a significantly reduced near term outlook for the businesses that gives effect to the changing business environment which led us to perform an impairment analysis of the goodwill in this reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis  the goodwill in this reporting unit was determined to be impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
the decrease in the fair value of this reporting unit was due to a significant decrease in the projected results for the full fiscal year and future years as a result of the factors previously discussed 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
as a result  we recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal  in addition to a charge of million in fiscal  writing off the remaining goodwill balance of the wholesale premium reporting unit in the wholesale segment 
sterno as a result of the our annual impairment analyses in fiscal  we determined that the goodwill balance existing at the sterno reporting unit in the wholesale segment was impaired 
in fiscal  the sterno reporting unit experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared to prior years results and budgeted fiscal expectations 
therefore  we recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the sterno reporting unit of the wholesale segment 
during fiscal  we reassessed the goodwill of the sterno reporting unit for impairment 
in the sterno reporting unit  our decision to discontinue sales of a new product line coupled with sharply rising commodity costs  along with a decline in operating performance when compared to prior years results and budgeted fiscal expectations led us to perform analyses of goodwill within the reporting unit 
as a result of these reviews  the goodwill in this reporting unit was determined to be impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
the decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit was due to a significant decrease in the projected results for the full fiscal year and future years as a result of the factors previously discussed 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
as a result  we recorded non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charges totaling million in the wholesale segment  in addition to the million charge taken in fiscal these adjustments completely eliminated the remaining goodwill balance of the sterno reporting unit within the wholesale segment 
miles kimball as a result of our january  annual impairment assessment  we determined that the goodwill related to the miles kimball reporting unit  in the catalog internet segment  was impaired 
in fiscal  the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth than anticipated when compared to the fiscal budget and beyond 
we believe this shortfall in performance was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions that were prevailing during the later part of fiscal as a result of the analysis  the goodwill in this reporting unit was determined to be impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the table below is a summary of estimated fair values as of january  and and the assumptions used in comparison to the carrying values in assessing recoverability for the miles kimball reporting unit of the catalog internet segment 
s in millions estimated fair value recorded carrying value of assets excess impaired value to recorded value assumptions and other information discount rate average revenue growth rate tax rate terminal multiple of ebitda capital expenditures goodwill at risk other long lived assets at risk as a result of the reduced near term outlook and the changing business environment  the terminal multiple of ebitda was reduced from to the change in this assumption reflects the continued changes in the business environment and adverse business conditions we are currently experiencing due to decreased consumer spending 
management believes the adverse conditions currently being experienced are not temporary  but rather reflect the additional risk in the marketplace as a result of additional economic and pricing pressures 
other in august  we acquired a interest in boca java  a small gourmet coffee and tea company 
boca java sells its products primarily through the internet and is included in the catalog internet segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have determined that boca java represents a separate reporting unit and thus must be reviewed for impairment on a stand alone basis 
we have completed the january  impairment assessment which indicated that the goodwill of million is fully recoverable 
boca java is a relatively new operation and the recoverability of its goodwill is dependent upon achieving high revenue growth and other operating objectives as well as the continued support and funding from its parent 
should boca java fail to meet its revenue and operating objectives or fail to receive the continued support of its parent  its goodwill could be subject to a partial or full impairment 
our direct selling segment has approximately million of goodwill 
the january  impairment assessment of this segment indicates that the goodwill is fully recoverable 
the direct selling segment currently generates a significant amount of cash flows  and therefore the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value by a wide margin 
significant assumptions if actual revenue growth  profit margins  costs and capital spending should differ significantly from the assumptions included in our business outlook used in the cash flow models  the reporting unit s fair value could fall significantly below expectations and additional impairment charges could be required to write down goodwill to its fair value and  if necessary  other long lived assets could be subject to a similar fair value test and possible impairment 
long lived assets represent primarily fixed assets and other long term assets excluding goodwill and other intangibles 
there are two main assumptions that are used for the discounted cash flow analysis first  the discount rate and second the terminal multiple 
this discount rate is used to value the gross cash flows expected to be derived from the business to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
for the terminal multiple  we used earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by a factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates  among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow model if there is a higher degree of risk that the business outlook objectives might not be achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  confidence in the business unit management  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
if management believes there is additional risk associated with the business outlook it will adjust the discount rate and terminal value accordingly 
the terminal value is generally a multiple of ebitda and is discounted to its net present value using the discount rate 
capital expenditures are included and are consistent with the historical business trend plus any known significant expenditures 
if the outlook for the miles kimball reporting unit as of january  was to be less optimistic than we had assumed in our valuation model  whereby we increased the discount rate by and decreased the terminal multiple by one  the fair value of the miles kimball reporting unit would have decreased by an additional million  resulting in an additional million goodwill impairment charge 
if the outlook for the miles kimball reporting unit as of january  was more optimistic than we had assumed in our valuation model  whereby we decreased the discount rate by and increased the terminal multiple by one  the fair value of the miles kimball reporting unit would have increased by million  reducing the impairment charge to million 
trade names and trademarks our trade name and trademark intangible assets relate to our acquisitions of miles kimball and walter drake in fiscal and are reported in the catalog internet segment 
we had approximately million in trade names and trademarks as of january  we perform our annual assessment of impairment for indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  which is our fiscal year end 
we use the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets 
the underlying concept of the relief from royalty method is that the inherent economic value of intangibles is directly related to the timing of future cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
similar to the income approach or discounted cash flow methodology used to determine the fair value of goodwill  the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is equal to the present value of after tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset based on an applicable royalty rate 
the royalty rate is determined by using existing market comparables for royalty agreements using an intellectual property data base 
the arms length agreements generally support a rate that is a percentage of direct sales 
this approach is based on the premise that the free cash flow is a more valid criterion for measuring value than book or accounting profits 
as a result of our january  impairment assessment  we determined that the recorded values of trade names and trademarks at miles kimball reporting unit  in the catalog internet segment  were impaired 
in fiscal  the miles kimball business experienced lower revenue growth than anticipated when compared to the fiscal budget and beyond 
we believe this shortfall in performance was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions 
as a result of the impairment analysis performed  the trade names and trademarks in this reporting unit were determined to be impaired  as their fair value was less than their carrying value 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the two primary assumptions used in the relief from royalty method are the discount rate and the royalty rate 
this discount rate is used to value the expected net cash flows to be derived from the royalty to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
the royalty rate is based upon past royalty performance as well as the expected royalty growth rate using both macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow analysis if there is a higher degree of risk that the estimated cash flows from the indefinite lived intangible asset may not be fully achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and microeconomic factors surrounding the business 
if  however  actual cash flows should fall significantly below expectations  this could result in an impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
if  as of january   the discount rate would have increased and the royalty rate would have decreased by  respectively  the fair value of the catalog internet trade names and trademarks would have decreased by million to million 
this decrease would have required us to take an additional impairment charge of million to write down our indefinite lived intangibles to its estimated fair value 
conversely  if the discount rate would have decreased and the royalty rate would have increased by  respectively  the fair value of the catalog internet trade names and trademarks would have increased by million  resulting in no impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
management periodically estimates our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for the potential tax assessments  primarily recorded in long term liabilities  total million and million at january  and  respectively 
accruals relate to tax issues for us federal  domestic state and taxation of foreign earnings 
we historically have not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed net earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the united states 
as of january  we determined that certain foreign subsidiaries undistributed net earnings were to be repatriated to the united states  and accordingly  us income taxes were provided for the earnings of those foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   we determined that million of undistributed foreign earnings were not reinvested indefinitely by our non us subsidiaries 
during fiscal  deferred income tax of million was recorded as a reduction to our net income on these unremitted earnings 
we periodically determine whether the non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate

forward looking and cautionary statements certain statements contained in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully elsewhere in this report and in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have operations outside of the united states and sell our products worldwide 
our activities expose us to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
these financial exposures are actively monitored and  where considered appropriate  managed by us 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on both variable rate debt and our investments in auction rate securities 
as of january   we are subject to interest rate risk on approximately million of variable rate debt 
a percentage point increase in the interest rate would not have a material impact on pre tax earnings 
as of january   we held million of auction rate securities and variable rate demand obligations 
a percentage point decrease in the rate of return would impact pre tax earnings by approximately million if applied to the total 
on july   we terminated the interest rate swap agreement in relation to million of outstanding senior notes  which mature on october  this termination resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was deferred and is being amortized over the remaining term of the notes 
at january  and  there was million and million  respectively  remaining to be amortized 
foreign currency risk we use foreign exchange forward and options contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated inventory purchases  intercompany payables and certain intercompany loans 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we hedged the net assets of certain of our foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts during fiscal this hedge terminated during fiscal and the net after tax gain related to the derivative net investment hedge instrument recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci totaled million at january  we have designated our forward exchange and options contracts on forecasted intercompany purchases and future purchase commitments as cash flow hedges and  as such  as long as the hedge remains effective and the underlying transaction remains probable  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts will be recorded in aoci until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being hedged 
with regard to commitments for inventory purchases  upon payment of each commitment  the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding gain or loss is transferred from aoci and is included in the measurement of the cost of the acquired asset 
if a hedging instrument is sold or terminated prior to maturity  gains and losses are deferred in aoci until the hedged item is settled 
however  if the hedged item is no longer likely to occur  the resultant gain or loss on the terminated hedge is recognized into earnings immediately 
amounts included in aoci at january  are million  net of tax  and are expected to be transferred into earnings within the next twelve months upon payment of the underlying commitment 
we have designated our foreign currency forward contracts related to certain foreign denominated loans and intercompany payables as fair value hedges 
the gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge 
for consolidated financial statement presentation  net cash flows from such hedges are classified in the categories of the consolidated statements of cash flows with the items being hedged
