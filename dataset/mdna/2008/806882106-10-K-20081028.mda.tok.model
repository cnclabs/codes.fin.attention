business the company operates in three reportable segments mrb  apb and smb  which collectively provide an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through the company s integrated businesses 
mrb purchases  collects  processes  recycles sells  trades and brokers ferrous scrap metal containing iron to foreign and domestic steel producers  including smb  and nonferrous metal not containing iron to both domestic and export markets 
mrb processes large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by sorting  shearing  shredding and torching  resulting in metal processed into pieces of a size  density and purity required by customers to meet their production needs 
apb purchases used and salvaged vehicles primarily from tow companies  private parties  auto auctions  charities  and city contracts  and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its self service and full service auto parts stores 
the remaining portions of the vehicles  primarily autobodies  cores and nonferrous materials  are sold to metal recyclers  including mrb where geographically feasible 
smb operates a steel mini mill that produces a wide range of finished steel products 
smb purchases substantially all of its recycled metal requirements from mrb at rates that approximate west coast export market prices and uses its electric arc furnace eaf mini mill near portland  oregon  to melt recycled metal and other raw materials to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains mill depots in central and southern california 
the company s results of operations depend in large part on demand and prices for recycled metal in global and domestic markets and steel products in the western us the company s deep water port facilities on both the west and east coasts of the us and in hawaii allow the company to take advantage of demand for recycled metal by steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  mexico and the mediterranean 
the company s processing facilities in the southeastern us also provide access to the growing automobile and steel manufacturing industries in that region 
market prices for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal fluctuate periodically  but have generally increased over the past three years 
however  during the second half of the fiscal fourth quarter selling prices for future deliveries of scrap metal began to decline 
key factors and trends affecting the industries in which the company operates and its results of operations the following key factors and trends affect the industries in which the company operates worldwide production and consumption of steel products  general economic conditions  competition  consolidation in the scrap metal and the steel industries  fragmentation of the auto parts industry and volatility in selling prices of the company s products and the purchase prices of raw materials  including scrap metal 
the following key factors and trends specifically affect the company s results of operations the integration of acquired businesses  replacement or installation of capital equipment  reliance on key pieces of equipment  cost and availability of product transportation  availability of credit and ability of customers to perform on contracts  supply and price of raw materials  union relationships and pension and postretirement benefits 
these key factors and trends are discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the company completed a very successful year in fiscal  achieving record sales levels for the seventh consecutive year and the highest net income in the company s history 
during fiscal  the company continued to benefit from high selling prices for all of its steel and scrap metal products 
these increases were driven by strong worldwide schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents demand for steel and recycled scrap metal products  which resulted in selling prices for steel and scrap metal reaching unprecedented levels 
the increases were also driven by the company s ongoing focus on increasing throughput in all three of its operating divisions 
however  during the second half of the fiscal fourth quarter  the company experienced a significant reduction in the selling prices for future deliveries of scrap metal  which decreased at a faster rate than average purchase costs 
the company generated consolidated revenues of billion for fiscal  an increase of billion  or  from billion in fiscal consolidated operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or compared to the prior year net income of million 
diluted net income per share for the year was  a increase from fiscal mrb revenues increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this included a million  or  increase in ferrous revenues and a million  or  increase in nonferrous revenues 
the increase in ferrous revenues was driven by a increase in average net selling price for processed ferrous  a increase in the average net selling price for ferrous trading and an increase in processed ferrous sales tons  which was partially offset by a decrease in ferrous trading volumes  primarily due to the company s focus on higher margin processed ferrous operations 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by a increase in pounds sold  which was primarily the result of the throughput due to the incremental impact of capacity growth during fiscal and  and a increase in the average net selling price 
operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal mrb primarily sells its products externally to export markets while purchasing its raw materials domestically 
during much of fiscal  the selling price of recycled metal increased at a faster rate than the cost of purchasing raw materials  contributing to higher operating income 
the million increase in operating income reflected the impact of the higher ferrous and nonferrous selling prices and higher processed ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes that were partially offset by higher raw material costs  including a net realizable value nrv inventory adjustment of million in the fourth quarter and lower ferrous trading volumes 
in addition  the increase in operating income was further offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation related expenses  including annual incentive expense  resulting from the company s improved financial and operating performance in fiscal and increased headcount resulting from incremental growth experienced during fiscal and  a million increase in share based compensation expense and a million increase in professional service costs 
apb revenues increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was driven by a million  or  increase in scrap vehicle revenue  primarily from the self service stores  a million  or  increase in core revenue  and a million  or  increase in part sales 
the increase in scrap vehicle revenue was due to a increase in the average scrap selling price per car and a increase in tons shipped 
the increase in core revenue was primarily due to a increase in the average core sales per car and a increase in cars crushed 
operating income for apb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the million  or  increase in operating income reflected the impact of higher sales volume and prices  which increased at a greater rate than the purchase costs for scrapped vehicles  partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation related expenses  a million increase in professional services and a million increase in marketing and advertising expense 
smb revenues increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher average net selling prices for finished steel products and increased sales volumes 
the average net selling price increased per ton  or  to per ton in fiscal compared to fiscal and resulted in increased revenues of million 
sales volumes for finished steel products increased  tons  or  to  tons in fiscal compared to the prior year and resulted in increased revenues of million 
the increase in volumes was primarily schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents due to a reduction of imports into the domestic steel market as a result of the declining value of the us dollar and higher overseas prices  resulting in lower availability of finished steel products for sale in the us operating income for smb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily the result of higher sales volumes and higher average net selling prices that were partially offset by increased costs for scrap metal and other raw materials 
business acquisitions the company intends to continue to focus on growth through value creating acquisitions and will pursue acquisition opportunities it believes will create shareholder value and earn after tax income in excess of its cost of capital 
with the company s historically strong balance sheet  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity  the company believes it is in a position to continue to complete reasonably priced acquisitions fitting the company s long term strategic plans 
in fiscal  the company completed the following acquisitions in september  the company acquired a mobile metals recycling business that provides additional sources of scrap metal to the everett  massachusetts facility 
the company acquired two metals recycling businesses in november and one metals recycling business in february that expanded the company s presence in the southeastern us in february  the company acquired the remaining equity interest in an auto parts business located in nevada in exchange for its interest in the land and buildings owned by the business 
the acquired business was previously consolidated into the company s financial statements because the company maintained operating control over the entity 
in august  the company acquired a self service used auto parts business with three locations in the southern us the acquisitions completed in fiscal were not material  individually or in the aggregate  to the company s financial position or results of operations 
in fiscal  the company completed the following acquisitions in december  the company acquired a metals recycling business to provide additional sources of scrap metal for the mega shredder in everett  massachusetts 
in may  the company acquired two metals recycling businesses that separately provide scrap metal to the everett  massachusetts and tacoma  washington facilities 
the acquisitions completed in fiscal were not material  individually or in the aggregate  to the company s financial position or results of operations

corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expenses for services that benefit all three business segments 
as a consequence of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would have as a stand alone business 
recycled ferrous metal sales from mrb to smb are made at rates per ton that approximate export market prices 
in addition  the company has autobody sales from apb to mrb 
consequently  these intercompany revenues produce intercompany operating income  which is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  and therefore intercompany profit is eliminated

these increases at the schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents reporting segments were primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense of million due to increased headcount  annual incentive compensation and share based compensation expense recognized for fiscal and a million increase related to higher allocated information technology costs 
the net decrease at corporate was due primarily to the million charge in fiscal associated with the doj and the sec investigation into the company s past payment practices in asia as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the net decrease at corporate for fiscal also included an million increase in compensation costs resulting from increased headcount  annual incentive compensation expense and share based compensation expense

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal revenues mrb generated revenues of billion for fiscal before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million over fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous metal due to strong worldwide demand for scrap metal and higher ferrous processed and nonferrous volumes due to the company s focus on increasing throughput and the incremental impact of the capacity growth experienced during fiscal and outbound freight costs  which are included in the cost of sales  increased by to million for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased volumes and higher ocean freight rates 
ferrous revenues increased million  during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in ferrous revenues was driven by both higher average net selling prices and increased volumes 
the average net selling price for ferrous processing increased per ton  or  from fiscal to fiscal the average net selling price for ferrous trading increased per ton  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal processed ferrous sales volume increased by  tons during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of the strategy to increase the volume of metal purchases and maximize throughput  which was accomplished through increased purchases of ferrous materials and increased production as a result of the company s investment in mega shredders 
trading ferrous sales volume decreased by  tons compared to fiscal primarily due to the company s focus on the higher margin processed ferrous and nonferrous operations and the lower quantities of scrap available for export in the baltic sea region 
nonferrous revenues increased million for fiscal compared to the same period last year 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven primarily by increased volumes 
nonferrous pounds shipped increased million pounds for fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in pounds shipped was primarily due to improved recovery of nonferrous materials processed through the new mega shredders  which have state of the art back end sorting systems  the higher overall volume being processed at the company s facilities  greater purchases of unprocessed materials and the incremental impact of capacity growth experienced during fiscal and the average net selling price remained relatively consistent in fiscal and fiscal certain nonferrous metals are a byproduct of the shredding process and quantities available for shipment are affected by the volume of materials processed through the company s shredders 
segment operating income operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue reflects the impact of the higher net selling prices for ferrous and nonferrous metal  which outpaced increased costs for freight and raw materials  and increased processed ferrous and nonferrous volumes 
in addition  income from joint ventures increased by million  or  over the prior year  primarily due to the strong demand for scrap metal 
included in cost of goods sold was a million nrv adjustment to reduce the value of inventory as of august  to the lower of cost or market resulting from a significant decline in the future selling prices of scrap metal that began in the second half of the fiscal fourth quarter 
further offsetting the increases in average selling prices and volume was a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily due to million of higher compensation related expenses  including annual incentive compensation expense  resulting from the company s improved financial and operating performance and increased headcount resulting from the incremental capacity growth experienced during fiscal and  a million increase in professional and outside services and a million increase in share based compensation expense

operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the million increase in operating income was directly related to higher net selling prices and the increase in sales volume 
outlook during the second half of the fourth fiscal quarter  demand for ferrous metal began to soften and future selling prices declined 
recent challenges in the credit markets for the buyers of steel and scrap metal  high inventory levels and the potential for a global economic slow down accelerated the softening of demand

outlook apb operates two distribution channels in the used auto parts industry 
the first  self service auto parts  depends heavily on wholesale revenues from the sale of scrap and cores 
at the end of fiscal  the market for recycled metal began a significant and rapid decline 
in addition  the rapid decline in selling prices for recycled metal seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal has resulted in a reduced flow of scrapped vehicles available for purchase in comparison with the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the above factors  apb currently believes that fiscal selling prices for cores and scrap will be lower than those seen in due to the high level of uncertainty regarding the economic environment  apb s past trends of sales volumes may not be indicative of expected volumes in fiscal demand in apb s second distribution channel  full service used auto parts  is driven primarily by the professional repair market 
current industry statistics indicate that due to higher fuel costs and the recent weakening of the us economy  total miles driven in the us have begun to decline  resulting in fewer accidents  and as a consequence reduced demand for collision repair parts

smb acquired substantially all of its scrap metal requirements from mrb at rates that approximate west coast export market prices 
fiscal compared with fiscal smb generated revenues of million in fiscal before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million over fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of per ton in the average net selling price and an increase of  tons sold in fiscal over fiscal the average net selling price increased as a result of increased worldwide steel consumption and higher raw material costs that manufacturers passed through in the form of higher prices 
the increase in sales volume was primarily due to increased demand from customers and capital improvements by smb that enabled the steel mill to increase output to meet the demand

the decrease in operating income reflects the impact of a increase in the cost of scrap metal  which outpaced the increase in average selling price per ton  an increase of per ton in conversion costs  primarily related to higher costs for raw materials other than scrap metal and million in costs associated with the planned shut down of the larger rolling mill in the third quarter of fiscal outlook smb sells its products primarily to construction markets located on the west coast of the us and competes against both domestic and foreign steel manufacturers 
during fiscal  west coast construction demand softened  but a weakening us dollar and higher selling prices for steel products overseas resulted in a significant reduction of imported steel available for sale in the us as a result  the market for steel products tightened and smb was able to achieve record selling prices and record sales volumes 
at the beginning of fiscal  weakening us economic conditions have led to a further contraction of construction demand 
coupled with a stronger us dollar and potential pressure from imported steel products  smb currently believes that if current market trends continue  fiscal selling prices will be lower than those seen in due to the high level of uncertainty regarding the economic environment  smb s past trends of sales volumes may not be indicative of expected volumes in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company relies on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity  supplemented by current cash resources and existing credit facilities

in fiscal  the company froze further benefit accruals in its defined benefit plan 
however  due to changes in the market and lower than expected returns on plan assets  the company made a million contribution to the defined benefit plan in fiscal the company does not anticipate making additional contributions to the defined benefit plan in fiscal however  changes in the discount rate or actual investment returns lower than the long term expected return on plan assets could result in the company making future additional contributions 
the company expects to make contributions to its various defined contribution plans of approximately million in fiscal in addition  the company anticipates making million of contributions to the multi employer plans  including a contribution of more than million for the multi employer plan benefiting union employees of smb 
the company believes any additional funding requirements would not have a material impact on its financial condition

assessment of liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s available cash resources  internally generated funds  credit facilities and equity offerings have financed its acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other financing needs 
the company generally believes its current cash resources  internally generated funds  and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents debt service requirements  post retirement obligations and future environmental obligations  however  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
deteriorating general economic conditions may result in the company further utilizing its available credit lines and curtailing capital and operating expenditures  delaying or restricting acquisitions and share repurchases and reassessing working capital requirements 
should the company determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  the company will evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained  or if obtained  would be adequate or on terms acceptable to the company 
however  the company believes that its balance sheet at august  and the level of its existing credit facilities should position it to obtain additional sources of liquidity if required 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases  the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial conditions  results of operations or cash flows 
the company enters into operating leases for both new equipment and property

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the company s portrayal of its financial condition and operating results 
these estimates require difficult and subjective judgments  including whether estimates are required to be made about matters that are inherently uncertain  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  environmental costs  assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies  pension plan assumptions  share based compensation assumptions and revenue recognition 
inventories the company s inventories primarily consist of ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal  ferrous processed metal  used and salvaged vehicles and finished steel products consisting of rebar  coiled rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
mrb determines the cost of ferrous and nonferrous inventories principally using the average cost method and capitalizes substantially all direct costs and yard costs into inventory 
apb establishes cost for used and salvaged vehicle inventory based on the average price the company pays for a vehicle 
the self service business capitalizes only the vehicle cost into inventory while the full service business capitalizes the vehicle cost  dismantling and  where applicable  storage and towing fees into inventory 
smb establishes its finished steel product inventory cost based on a weighted average cost and capitalizes all direct and indirect costs of manufacturing into inventory 
indirect costs of manufacturing include general plant costs  maintenance  human resources and yard costs 
the company evaluates whether its inventory is properly valued at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
the company considers estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value for its inventory 
however  as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  it utilizes the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated market price of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and orders 
based upon mrb s estimate of the net realizable value of its inventory at august   an adjustment of million was made to reduce the value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market 
if mrb s estimate of selling prices per ton increased or decreased by  the estimate of the net realizable value adjustment would increase or decrease by million at august  the accounting process utilized by the company to record unprocessed metal and used and salvaged vehicle inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  the company relies on perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of the company s inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  the company runs periodic tests and performs monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts the value of its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  the company is required to assess goodwill for impairment at schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
the first step determines whether or not impairment has occurred by estimating the fair value of its reporting units using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to the company s market capitalization at the date of valuation 
the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by management 
selected costs and statistics used to evaluate goodwill are typically related to pricing and volumes of goods sold  costs as a percentage of revenues and the cyclicality inherent in the company s industries 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors which the company considers in its recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include the following current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the clean up  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site  which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of senior level internal staff  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  and studies of the company s sites  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
deferred taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences at fiscal year end between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
periodically  the company reviews its deferred tax assets to assess whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent the assets are more likely than not to be unrealized 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of the company s deferred tax assets is significantly different than the expectations  the value of the company s deferred tax assets could be materially overstated 
the company established a valuation allowance of million at august  for state tax credits that may expire before they are used 
pension plans the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for certain of its non union employees 
pension plans are a significant cost of doing business  and the related obligations are expected to be settled far in the future 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans results in the current recognition of liabilities and net periodic pension cost over employees expected service periods based on the terms of the plans and the impact of the company s investment and funding decisions 
the measurement of pension obligations and recognition of liabilities and costs require significant schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the assets of the plan  may have an impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results will often differ from assumptions relating to long term rates of return for equities and fixed income securities because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate assumption as of august  was 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would reduce or increase the net pension liability by approximately million as of august  and accumulated other comprehensive income would be reduced or increased by the same amount  adjusted for taxes  and net periodic cost for fiscal would be reduced or increased by  the weighted average expected return on assets assumption as of august  was 
the expected return on assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be measured over a long period based on past experience 
a increase or decrease in this assumption would reduce or increase net periodic pension cost by  share based compensation effective september   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  shared based payment sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation in net income 
share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted after september  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the company recognizes compensation expense  net of a forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the three year performance period for performance based shares 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility  which is based on historical month end closing stock prices 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  the company s share based compensation expense for performance based awards could be materially different in the future 
if the company s actual payout assumption is materially different from its estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
if the pay out assumption changed by  share based compensation related to performance awards would increase or decrease by million 
see note share based compensation  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the company has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both scrap metal and finished steel products transfers upon shipment  based on either cost  insurance and freight or free on board terms 
a significant portion of the company s ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment 
for retail sales by apb  revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when the sale is recognized

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company is exposed to commodity price risk  mainly associated with variations in the market price for ferrous and nonferrous metal  including scrap  autobodies and other commodities 
the timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions 
the company responds to changes in recycled metal selling prices by adjusting purchase prices on a timely basis and by turning rather than holding inventory in expectation of higher prices 
the company actively manages its exposure to commodity price risk and monitors the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense 
sales contracts are based on spot market prices  and generally orders are placed to days ahead of shipment date 
however  financial results may be negatively impacted where selling prices fall more quickly than purchase price adjustments can be made or when levels of inventory have an anticipated net realizable value that is below average cost 
if mrb s estimate of selling prices per ton increased or decreased by  the estimate of the net realizable value adjustment would increase or decrease by million 
the company is also exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market prices for electricity and natural gas  most significantly related to smb s energy requirements for its steel mini mill facility 
the company s risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within its production processes has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future and expected requirements for such commodities 
smb purchases electricity under a long term contract which expires in september the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed upon fixed rate energy charge per million kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 
a increase in electricity rates would have resulted in a million impact on fiscal cost of goods sold 
smb also has a take or pay natural gas contract based on fixed prices that expires on may  and obligates it to purchase minimum quantities per day through october  whether or not the amount is utilized 
the natural gas contract is subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of august  the fair value of the natural gas contract derivative and the unrealized loss was million  compared to million at august  the fair value of the natural gas contract derivative is determined using a forward price curve based on observable market price quotations at a major natural gas trading hub 
the company s valuation model is updated monthly to reflect current market information 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in forward market prices for contracted volumes would have changed the fair value at august  by million 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to its debt obligations 
the company s credit line and revolving credit facility are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed from actual interest rate levels in fiscal or  the effect on the company s interest expense and net income would not have been material 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations 
the company extends credit based on a variety of methods  including letters of credit on ferrous scrap exports  establishment of credit limits for a proportion of sales on open terms  collection of deposits for certain nonferrous export customers and open terms 
mrb generally ships ferrous bulk sales to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks deemed credit worthy by the company 
the letters of credit ensure payment by the customer 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  mrb s customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices  as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship 
however  in periods of declining prices  mrb s customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped 
as such  the company may need to extend credit on open terms for the difference between the sales value under the contract and the value supported by the letter of credit 
in addition  the company could be exposed to loss if a customer fails to pay or the bank providing the letter of credit fails 
as of august   of the company s total accounts receivable balance was covered by letters of credit 
of the remaining balance was less than days past due
