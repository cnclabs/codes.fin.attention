basis of presentation of management s discussion and analysis on may   we committed to a plan to sell our united kingdom based subsidiary  medicals direct group mdg  through which we provided medical related risk assessment services in the united kingdom 
the decision to sell mdg was based on several factors  including our perception that mdg had a limited ability to make a significant contribution to our long term strategic goals 
we completed the sale in october for an aggregate purchase price of million 
upon closing the transaction  we received a cash payment of million  net of million in closing adjustments 
in addition we incurred million of expenses related to the sale 
we are scheduled to receive additional consideration post closing as follows million within nine months of closing  and million within months of closing 
in the fourth quarter of we recognized a net gain on the sale of approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
except where specific discussion of mdg is made  our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition excludes mdg for all periods presented 
highlights and business outlook for leadership transition on february   james d 
calver resigned from his positions as the president and chief executive officer of the company  and as a member of our board of directors 
the board appointed roy h 
bubbs  a member of the board  to serve as the interim president and ceo 
mr 
bubbs has served as a member of the board since being elected to the board by the company s shareholders at the may annual shareholders meeting 
mr 
bubbs has been in the financial services industry for years 
as president of mony partners he created the brokerage division for the mony group  leading strategy  infrastructure  operations and business plan implementation 
his experience in expanding distribution channels  instituting new technology platforms and developing new product portfolios enabled mony to generate significant growth 
prior to joining mony  mr 
bubbs was senior vice president for manulife  us  where his responsibilities included developing and implementing a multiple distribution channel strategy to reinvigorate insurance sales and eliminate distribution expense losses 
for the first years of his career  mr 
bubbs was with cigna  where he served as an agent  agency manager and senior executive 
as senior vice president  he was responsible for half of cigna s career agency sales force 
he also ran the distribution and field service unit for cigna s pension division and built the annuity division 
we believe that achieving acceptable profitability levels will require top line revenue growth  including the reversal of past revenue declines experienced in our core portamedic business 
we have approvals from over of the insurance carriers in the marketplace  and yet our number of paramedical examinations completed on life insurance applicants continues to decline in our portamedic business unit 
we must achieve greater success in turning carrier approvals into unit sales at the local agent  corporate and brokerage levels 
under our new leadership  we are taking steps to strengthen our local sales force we are hiring more sales representatives  streamlining our sales tracking systems  improving sales training  and focusing sales incentives on increases in paramedical exams completed ie unit goals 
in our portamedic business unit  we will continue to take advantage of cost saving opportunities as they arise  but our focus in will be on increasing profitable revenue 
portamedic infolink the rate of decline in the number of paramedical examinations completed by our portamedic business increased to in the fourth quarter compared to the corresponding period of  a rate of decline that exceeded our decline experienced in the first nine months of as a result of certain initiatives implemented in  we had expected the rate of decline to lessen in the second half of the year 
the rate of decline for the full year was compared to there were approximately nine million applications for life insurance submitted in as a result  notwithstanding the rate of decline in applications submitted  we believe that the market continues to offer attractive opportunities to a company that can sell its services effectively and distinguish itself from its competitors 
we are taking the following steps to strengthen our sales and distinguish ourselves from our competitors we have introduced our portamedic platinum service  which provides reduced cycle times and a better quality of service for high premium insurance applications 
we have also introduced our mature assessment service  which enables insurance carriers to make better underwriting decisions on older applicants 
in march  we are scheduled to introduce a new quality imaging platform for all paramedical exam reports 
this platform allows our examiners to send their examination reports to our third party vendor  which will image the reports 
this new imaging platform is expected to reduce cycle time by providing a more efficient customer service review of examination reports 
we have introduced a revised fee payment system for our examiners 
we now pay examiners fees according to a set payment schedule for each service an examiner provides 
previously  examiners were paid a percentage of the dollar amount of the fees we billed to insurance carriers 
as this new payment system makes it easier for examiners to predict their income fixed vs 
variable  we are expecting it to improve examiner retention and productivity 
we expect to begin introducing managed scheduling across the portamedic business in may currently  many of our examiners schedule their own appointments with applicants  and it may take to days to schedule an examination 
in those markets where we have introduced managed scheduling on a pilot basis  we have reduced the time required to schedule an examination to as little as to days 
in  market conditions are expected to remain difficult for portamedic 
although the number of paramedical examinations portamedic performs continues to decline  we believe that we are the market leader in the industry 
we also believe that the steps we are taking in to improve our selling ability and the quality of our services will enable us to increase the number of paramedical examinations that portamedic completes each year 
however  our focus in will be on increasing profitable revenue 
we have a small number of accounts where it actually costs us more than we charge to deliver our services 
while we will try to renegotiate these contracts  we may in some cases terminate the account when the applicable contractual obligations expire 
this effort to eliminate unprofitable revenue may increase the rate of decline in the number of paramedical examinations portamedic completes each year 
heritage labs heritage labs business consists principally of performing tests of blood  urine and or oral fluid specimens  and the assembly and sale of kits used in the collection and transportation of such specimens to its lab facility 
in  approximately of heritage s revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of specimen kits 
since much of heritage s revenue originates from paramedical exam companies including portamedic  heritage is affected by the same negative market trends affecting portamedic  namely the decline in the number of life insurance applications 
in response  heritage has taken steps to expand its marketshare and increase revenues heritage is strengthening its sales force 
heritage expects to fill the newly created position of vp of sales with an individual with significant experience in the life insurance industry  in the first quarter of it also expects to add a medical director in the first quarter 
we have added incentives for portamedic sales representatives to sell heritage lab s services 
heritage continues to expand its kit assembly business 
heritage is an fda registered class i and class ii medical device assembler 
of the three laboratories providing testing services to the insurance industry only heritage is licensed to assemble kits 
in the first quarter of  heritage began to market a line of self collected finger stick test kits under the trade name appraise 
these kits test hemoglobin ac  lipids  and microalbumin 
the hemoglobin ac test is particularly important for diabetics  who must constantly monitor their hemoglobin ac levels 
one major challenge in for heritage labs is the loss of a significant customer who will transfer their lab testing services to a different company s lab 
the customer expressed no dissatisfaction with heritage in terms of quality or service 
as a result of this loss of revenue  heritage s annual revenues are expected to decline by approximately million  beginning towards the end of the first quarter of hooper holmes underwriting solutions hhus our underwriting solutions business provides underwriting services including full underwriting  simplified issue underwriting  trial application analysis  telephone interviewing  and point of sale services  retrieves and summarizes attending physicians statements apss  retrieves prescription histories  and performs underwriting audits 
hhus made strong progress in in migrating from their significant reliance on one major customer 
although revenue was down in as a result of this migration  revenues from new hhus customers approximated million in hhus now provides underwriting services to companies 
in  replacing this lost revenue will remain a challenge  along with the previously noted declining number of applications for life insurance 
in response  not only is hhus making efforts to expand its existing lines of business  it is also seeking to expand its role in the rapidly growing life settlements market 
hhus s role in the life settlement market is to assist the life settlement brokers and providers by gathering medical related information on the policyholder and assigning a life expectancy rating 
at present  hhus is a small player in this market 
we are seeking to obtain a life settlement license in the state of florida  which we see as being important to the growth of our life settlement business 
however  hhus is facing various regulatory challenges in connection with the application  stemming from it being part of a publicly traded company 
hhus is currently working with the state of florida to resolve these issues 
health wellness our health and wellness business  established in  exceeded our expectations  recording approximately million in revenues and completing approximately  health screenings 
we provided our services to health management companies in the results of our health wellness business are currently reported in our portamedic business unit approximately of the h w revenue and heritage labs approximately of the h w revenue 
h w s services include event scheduling  provision and fulfillment of all supplies eg  examination kits  blood pressure cuffs  stadiometers  scales  centrifuges  lab coats  bandages  etc 
at screening events  event management  biometric screenings height  weight  bmi  hip  waist  neck  pulse  blood pressure and blood draws via venipuncture or fingerstick  lab testing  participant and aggregate reporting  data processing and data transmission 
heritage labs does all of the testing on the samples we collect at health and wellness screenings 
through a strategic partnership  h w is also able to provide the know your number suite of reporting services 
know your number includes an online health risk assessment  participant report  physician report  participant letter with interventional recommendations  and an aggregate report with interventional recommendations 
according to the boston consulting group  in a report entitled realizing the promise of disease management  issued in february  the disease management health and wellness market could be approximately million by we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of that market 
however  the success of h w will depend in part upon the proven success of disease management and health and wellness initiatives 
if the return on investment in these initiatives is not sufficiently high  our health and wellness business may not reach its full potential 
notwithstanding  in we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity given our company s unique set of assets  including our own lab heritage  systems and personnel and access to our network of paramedical examiners 
claims evaluation division ced our claims evaluation division s services encompass arranging independent medical exams imes 
an ime is a medical examination by a doctor other than the claimant s physician for the purpose of rendering an objective opinion regarding the nature  origin  and treatment of an injury  typically to establish whether the claimant needs further treatment or is disabled  or to determine what medical expenses are eligible for payment or reimbursement 
in addition to imes  ced also provides other ancillary services to its customers 
we believe that the market for ced s services may be contracting 
there are a number of factors that may be contributing to this trend  including the decrease in manufacturing employment levels in the united states and the associated decline in the rates of workplace injuries and  in turn  workers compensation claims  the reported decline in the number of people injured in automobile accidents in the united states  and changes in state laws and regulations that may reduce the need for our services 
in  ced will implement new technology in an effort to make the delivery of its services more efficient to our customers 
it is also diversifying its client base within the regions it operates 
write down of long lived assets and goodwill in the third quarter of  the following events and circumstances triggered an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  as well as the acceleration of our annual goodwill impairment analysis which we historically performed in the fourth quarter declining revenues and operating profits during the second and third quarters of compared to and the expectation that this decline will continue into the fourth quarter  quarterly and year to date revenues and operating income were significantly below budget and the expectation of below budget revenues and operating income continuing for the remainder of  continued contraction of the principle markets served by the ced  and reduced revenues from three of the ced s largest customers who have expanded their vendor base resulting in fewer cases referred to the ced 
upon completion of the impairment tests  we recorded non cash impairment charges to long lived assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
the million goodwill impairment charge represented a write off of all remaining goodwill 
as of december   there is no goodwill on our balance sheet 
for more information regarding these impairment charges  see the discussion under results of operations impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
key financial and other metrics monitored by management in our periodic reports filed with the sec  we provide certain financial information and metrics about our businesses and each of our two segments  information that our management uses in evaluating our performance and financial condition 
our objective in providing this information is to help our shareholders and investors generally understand our overall performance and assess the profitability of our businesses and our prospects for future net cash flows 
in  we primarily focused on tracking our actual results relative to our forecasts and budgets  and measuring the degree of success of efforts to align our costs with lower revenue levels 
with respect to our health information division  we monitored the following metrics the number of paramedical examinations performed by portamedic  the average revenue per paramedical examination  time service performance  from examination order to completion  the mib life index data which represents an indicator of the level of life insurance application activity  the number of tele interviewing underwriting reports we generate  the number of specimens tested by our heritage labs subsidiary  the average revenue per specimen tested  budget to actual performance at the branch level as well as in the aggregate  and customer and product line profitability 
with respect to our claims evaluation division  we monitored the following metrics the number of incoming cases by client and by insurance adjuster  time of service  which measures the time to complete a claim  from receipt to issuing a report  and budget to actual financial performance  including customer and product line profitability 
certain of the above cited metrics are discussed in the comparative discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows 
results of operations comparative discussion and analysis of results of operations in  and the table below sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations and other data  and certain key statistics  for the periods indicated 
revenues by component businesses and reporting segments in thousands for the years ended december change change hid portamedic infolink heritage labs underwriting solutions total hid ced total revenues consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decline of million or from the corresponding period of the prior year 
revenues for the year ended december  were million or million and below results 
as explained in greater detail below  similar market forces influenced the revenues and operating results of our two divisions  and the component businesses within our health information division throughout the three year period ended december  health information division our health information division s hid revenues of million for the year ended december  were million or below the prior year 
revenues for the year ended december  were million or below the corresponding period in portamedic the decline in revenues of our portamedic business has been the primary reason for the decline in hid revenues 
the decline in portamedic revenues for the years ended december   and reflect the net impact of fewer paramedical examinations performed   in   in  and  in  higher average revenue per paramedical examination in in vs 
in primarily attributable to price increase  and a lower average revenue per examination in in vs 
in  and revenue of approximately million related to health screenings for our health wellness services  established in early health screenings are similar to a paramedical examination  but are completed for health management companies  instead of insurance customers  we attribute the reduction in the number of paramedical examinations performed in and to the continued decline in life insurance application activity in the united states as reported by the mib life index and therefore the need for fewer paramedical examinations 
in addition to the decline in the number of exams resulting from a decrease in life insurance application activity  revenue also declined due to the consolidation closing of certain portamedic offices due to profitability considerations 
a significant amount of portamedic volume is derived from local agents and brokers  which has been negatively impacted by the elimination of certain offices  the loss of a customer in late due to pricing  which resulted in a revenue decline of approximately million in compared to  and reduction in revenue of approximately million from a client due to automation requirements which we could not meet within the customer specified timeframes 
the reduction in revenue in reflects the continuing effect of the loss of a significant customer which began in the first quarter of  and accounted for approximately of the portamedic s revenues in the lower average revenue per exam is primarily attributable to downward pricing pressure in both and from our insurance company customers in an effort to control their costs 
infolink our infolink business  tele underwriting interviewing and attending physician statement aps retrieval  the latter representing the larger of the two infolink revenue components  decreased to million for the full year of versus the same period of the prior year 
the decrease in revenues reflects i a decrease in the number of aps units and the number of tele interviewing units attributable to the reduced number of orders received as a result of our consolidation of branch office aps into our centralized facility in kansas city  ks in and ii the overall decline in life insurance application activity 
tele interviewing units declined during compared to the same period of the prior year  due to a significant volume reduction from one major customer 
the advantages offered by teledex orders has not been fully embraced by our insurance company clients as most are not prepared to accept this information electronically 
however  the average revenue per unit increased approximately for compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to a price increase instituted for certain customers 
our revenues in from our infolink business were million  an increase of compared to the increase was attributable to an increase in customers utilizing our tele underwriting services  along with an increased number of reports requested from existing customers 
heritage labs heritage labs revenues in were million  an increase of million or compared to although heritage labs tested fewer specimens  vs 
 in compared to the prior year  heritage s average revenue per specimen tested increased in vs 

in  heritage also generated approximately million in revenue from lab testing and specimen kits related to wellness health screenings 
the reduced demand for heritage labs services from insurance companies is primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of paramedical examinations completed by the company s portamedic business unit 
approximately of total specimens tested by heritage originate from a portamedic paramedical exam 
the increased average revenue per specimen is primarily due to a change of business mix  with a greater emphasis on more complex testing 
heritage labs revenues in were million  a decline of million or compared to heritage labs tested fewer specimens  vs 
 in compared to heritage s average revenue per specimen tested increased in vs 

the reduced demand for heritage labs services was primarily attributable to the loss of a client as a result of that client being acquired by another insurance company  which is not a customer of heritage labs  along with volume reductions at a customer resulting from its decision to distribute their lab testing among several suppliers 
the increased average revenue per specimen was primarily the result of greater utilization of additional tests 
heritage labs laboratory currently operates at approximately of capacity 
we are exploring business opportunities  including specimen collection kit assembly and opportunities in the wellness and disease management markets  to utilize the additional capacity of our laboratory 
underwriting solutions underwriting solutions revenues declined in to million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to reduced revenue in from one major client of approximately million 
in  this client decided that in order to mitigate its risk in utilizing underwriting solutions as its sole outsourced underwriter  the client expanded its underwriter supplier network 
this loss of revenue was partially offset by increased revenue from new customers of approximately million  as underwriting solutions aggressively pursued these new opportunities 
underwriting solutions revenues in of million were down million or compared to the decrease was attributable to a reduction in the number of life insurance applications being underwritten for underwriting solutions customers in claims evaluation division our claims evaluation division s ced revenues for were million  down million or compared to the full year of the decline is primarily attributable to the following in early  ced was notified by a significant customer that in order to mitigate risk  one of the customer s major branch offices would migrate to a multi vendor supply chain 
ced s loss of the customer s exclusive business reduced revenues in by approximately million  a reduction in peer reviews in new york state  which we believe reflects increased cost consciousness on the part of property and casualty insurance carriers  self insureds and third party administrators and the perception that such reviews have been of limited value in litigating claims  a decrease in the number of workers compensation claims filed in the state of michigan  and a decrease in the number of independent medical exams imes ordered by our customers when evaluating a claim 
our claims evaluation division s revenues for were million  down million or compared to the full year of the decline was primarily attributable to the following a reduction in peer reviews in new york state  a decrease in the number of independent medical exams imes ordered by our customers when evaluating a claim  and a decrease in the number of claims referred to the division by its existing customer base 
cost of operations our total cost of operations amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in the following table shows the cost of operations as a percentage of revenues and  in the case of the hid  further broken down by certain of the component businesses during the last three years

the decrease in the cost of operations in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for compared to was primarily attributable to reduced branch operating expenses resulting from branch staff reductions and the consolidations of portamedic branch offices during and  the higher average revenue per portamedic examination  and a lower cost of operations percentage pertaining to our health wellness services  established in the increase in the cost of operations as a percentage of the hid s revenues in was primarily attributable to a decline in revenues in our portamedic  heritage labs and underwriting solutions businesses  without a corresponding adjustment to the applicable cost structures  higher fees paid to contract paramedical examiners  reflecting the company s efforts to retain and recruit qualified examiners  the lower average revenue per portamedic examination  and the higher proportion of segment revenues derived by our lower margin tele interviewing underwriting business relative to our higher margin portamedic paramedical exam business 
the increase in cost of operations in was partially offset by lower material costs for heritage labs 
claims evaluation division cost of operations for the ced totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cost of operations in absolute dollars for and compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year are a result of a reduction in direct costs associated with reduced revenue levels in each year 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations represented  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in and was primarily attributable to lower revenue levels of our higher margin peer review services  and increased costs associated with administering claims to our expanding geographic customer base 
revenues generated in regions outside of new york and michigan  where our network of physicians is less extensive  have higher physician costs

the sg a for the hid segment includes segment sg a plus sg a for all corporate overhead departments 
sg a expenses for the hid segment decreased million or to million for compared to million for the reduction in sg a expenses is primarily due to reduced regional and area managerial salaries and related operating expenses  million  along with reduced branch depreciation charges and reduced employee payroll tax costs resulting from branch office consolidations totaling million  reduced audit  general insurance costs and business tax fees totaling million  reduced intangible asset amortization expense in of approximately million as a result of the company s intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the decreases listed above were partially offset by the following increased depreciation costs resulting from continued development of our branch operating systems totaling million  increased share based compensation expense related to stock option grants made during and  totaling million  and increased outside legal costs totaling million 
sg a expenses for the hid segment increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the million increase in sg a in compared to was primarily due to increased it costs such as additional data networks  new software license and maintenance fees and increased depreciation expense in totaling approximately million  resulting from our new branch operating system and financial operating systems  additional expenses totaling million attributable to bank fees related to our previous credit facility and expenses associated with the completion of our strategic review  increased bad debt expense associated with the company s review of the collectability of certain portamedic accounts receivable of approximately million  and increased share based compensation expense  guaranteed incentive payments and increased business development costs totaling million 
the increases listed above have been partially offset by reduced intangible asset amortization expense in of approximately million as a result of the company s impairment charge recorded in for intangible assets

in absolute terms  sg a has decreased in each of the three years ended december  as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased in compared to due to expense reduction initiatives identified in the strategic review  along with savings from the consolidation of the ced companies into hooper evaluations and the resultant headcount reductions 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues in over was due to a decline in revenues without a corresponding reduction to sg a expenses 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in the third quarter of  we identified certain events and circumstances that triggered an impairment evaluation of our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 respectively 
intangible assets under sfas no 
 long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are to be tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
as discussed in the overview  there were several events and circumstances that constituted impairment indicators in the third quarter of accordingly  we initiated an impairment analysis of our intangible assets and determined that the carrying values of certain intangible assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows under the relief from royalty method and indicated that an impairment of certain of our intangible assets existed 
accordingly  in the third quarter of we recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge consisted of an impairment of ced tradenames and customer relationships and is recorded within impairment of goodwill and intangibles in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  goodwill under sfas no 
 the impairment test involves determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as would occur in a purchase transaction  treating the fair value of the reporting unit as the equivalent of the purchase price and deducting from that amount  the fair value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
we considered all of the impairment indicators previously discussed  as well as the impairment recorded on our intangibles assets and concluded that an impairment analyses of the ced reporting unit goodwill was required during the third quarter of we determined the fair values of the ced reporting unit utilizing market based methodologies 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of the ced reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
we have defined our reporting segments hid and ced as our reporting units for goodwill accounting 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 we were required to perform the second step of the impairment testing for the ced reporting unit 
this entailed adjusting the assets and liabilities of the ced reporting unit to their fair market values  for purposes of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
the analysis indicated a goodwill impairment of million 
this amount was recorded in the third quarter of and is included in impairment of goodwill and intangibles in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the million goodwill impairment charge represented a write off of all remaining goodwill 
as of december   there is no goodwill on our balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we also deemed it appropriate to test for impairment of our long lived assets  since certain impairment indicators were present including a preliminary expectation that the operating loss in the fourth quarter of was going to be greater than our fourth quarter forecast  the completion of our operating budget that reflected an assumption that some of the negative trends adversely affecting the company s results in would continue to a greater extent than our previous forecasts for and thereafter  and notification during the fourth quarter of a further decline in projected revenue for from a major customer within the underwriting solutions business 
upon completion of the impairment tests  we determined that certain intangible assets as well as goodwill for both reporting units were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded non cash impairment charges to certain intangible assets and goodwill of million in hid and million million in ced and million in hid  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual testing for impairment of goodwill  in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we also deemed it appropriate to test for impairment of long lived assets  since certain impairment indicators were present including an operating loss in the third quarter of  a preliminary expectation of an operating loss in the fourth quarter of projections of operating results in future periods that reflected an assumption that some of the negative trends adversely affecting each of the company s two divisions discussed above would continue  and a decline in the market price of our common stock over a sustained period of time 
upon completion of the impairment tests  we determined that certain intangible assets as well as goodwill for both reporting units were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded non cash impairment charges to certain intangible assets and goodwill of million million in ced and million in hid and million million in ced and million in hid  respectively 
restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
the charges are attributable to restructuring charges for employee severance and branch office closures totaling million  a litigation settlement charge of million pertaining to a threatened lawsuit against the company  the cancellation of a software development project approximating million  a settlement with a software provider concerning the use of software for the company s health wellness business totaling million 
for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
the charges are primarily attributable to restructuring charges for employee severance and branch office closures totaling million  a fee payable to outside consultants  including expenses  of million based on the results of the company s strategic review  a contract cancellation fee related to the early termination of a software resale agreement totaling million  legal and audit fees related to the company s restatement of its and financial statements of approximately million  and a litigation settlement charge of million pertaining to a lawsuit filed against the company alleging violations of california wage and hour laws 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of restructuring and other charges consisting of restructuring charges for employee severance and branch office closure costs of million  an aggregate of million in costs associated with the severance packages of our former chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other senior management members  and the cancellation of a software development project and contract cancellation fees approximating million 
operating loss from continuing operations our consolidated operating loss for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to a operating loss of million in the prior year 
the decrease results from a lower impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets of million million vs 
million lower restructuring and other charges of million million vs 
million and improved operating results of million million vs 
million 
our consolidated operating loss for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to an operating loss of million in the decrease results from a lower impairment charge on goodwill and intangibles of million million vs 
million partially offset by unfavorable operating results and increased restructuring and other charges 
health information division 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the hid segment recorded an operating loss of million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in and a million in as a percentage of revenues  the operating loss was for the year ended december   compared to in and in claims evaluation division 
operating income in was million compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  the ced s operating income was in  in and in income taxes we have significant deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductible intangibles  capital loss carryforwards  and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which may reduce taxable income in future periods 
in  we concluded that based on the decline in revenues and margin  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period  and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize the tax benefits of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate benefit for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
discontinued operations on october   we completed the sale of mdg for million 
a cash payment of million  net of closing adjustments of million  was received by the company 
in addition  we incurred million of expenses related to the sale 
additional payments to be received include  million within nine months of the closing and million within months of the closing 
we recognized a net gain on the sale of approximately million  which is reported in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the sale of mdg resulted in a tax loss however  no tax benefit was recorded as management determined that it would not be able to realize any tax benefit resulting from the loss 
see note net loss net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share in the same period of the prior year 
in  we reported a net loss of million or per diluted share

inflation inflation has not had  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  independent medical exam  peer review or similar services and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and collectibility must be reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to the company for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management continuously assesses the financial condition of our customers  the markets in which these customers participate as well as historical trends relating to customer deductions and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this periodic review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts receivables could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is an impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows from the business group to the carrying value of the long lived assets  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of the long lived assets based on discounted cash flow models 
as discussed in the overview  there were several events and circumstances that constituted impairment indicators in the third quarter of accordingly  we initiated an impairment analysis of our long lived assets and determined that the carrying values of certain long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
the fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows under the relief from royalty method and indicated that an impairment of certain of our intangible assets existed 
accordingly  during the third quarter of the company recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge consisted of an impairment of ced intangible assets eg  customer relationships and trade names and is recorded within impairment of goodwill and intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
goodwill impairment we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value to its fair value 
we have defined our two segments hid and ced as our sfas no 
reporting units 
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process of determining impairment 
in step one  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value and if the carrying value exceeds the fair value there is an impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units employing a combination of discounted cash flows and market multiples 
the second step identifies the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined as though the reporting unit was involved in a business acquisition ie the existing assets and liabilities are adjusted to fair market value and a value is placed on any unrecorded intangibles 
the fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit and the difference is implied goodwill 
during the third quarter of  we considered all of the impairment indicators previously discussed  as well as the impairment recorded on our long lived assets and concluded that an impairment analysis of the ced reporting unit goodwill was required 
we determined the fair value of the ced reporting unit utilizing market based methodologies 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of the ced reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 we were required to perform the second step of the impairment testing for the ced reporting unit 
this entailed adjusting the assets and liabilities of the ced reporting unit to their fair market values as of september   for purposes of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
the analysis indicated a goodwill impairment of million 
this amount was recorded in the third quarter of the million goodwill impairment charge represented a write off of all remaining goodwill 
as of december   there is no goodwill on our balance sheet 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
in the company concluded that based on the decline in revenues and margin  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period  and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  it was no longer more likely than not that it would realize the tax benefits of its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in share based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
compensation cost for stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year  except for certain provisions which have been deferred until the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  and the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the noncontrolling interest to be identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
sfas will also require that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we are still in the process of reviewing the impact of adopting this statement 
however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our credit facility is based on variable rates and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  our interest expense will vary as a result of interest rate changes and the level of any outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december   we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
