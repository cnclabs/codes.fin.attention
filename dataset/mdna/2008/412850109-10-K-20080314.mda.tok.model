item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the results of operations  capital resources and liquidity presented in its accompanying consolidated financial statements for harleysville national corporation the corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiaries harleysville national bank the bank  hnc financial company and hnc reinsurance company 
the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
current performance does not guarantee  and may not be indicative of  similar performance in the future 
the information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the corporation s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes under item and the forward looking statements on page of this report on form k 
critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the corporation and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices with the financial services industry 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
in applying accounting policies and preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
judgments and assumptions required by management  which have  or could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations are considered critical accounting estimates 
the following is a summary of the policies the corporation recognizes as involving critical accounting estimates allowance for loan loss  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment  stock based compensation  unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale  and deferred taxes 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates by management 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including historical losses  current and anticipated economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  borrowers perceived financial and management strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  the dependence on collateral  or the strength of the present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required which may adversely affect the corporation s results of operations in the future 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the corporation employs general industry practices in evaluating the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation calculates the fair value using a combination of the following valuation methods dividend discount analysis under the income approach  which calculates the present value of all excess cash flows plus the present value of a terminal value and price earnings multiple under the market approach 
management performed its annual review of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles at june  and determined there was no impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangibles 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation the corporation recognizes compensation expense for stock options in accordance with sfas revised  share based payment sfas r adopted at january  under the modified prospective application method of transition 
the expense of the option is generally measured at fair value at the grant date with compensation expense recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
for grants subject to a service condition  the corporation utilizes the black scholes option pricing model as used under sfas to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant 
the black scholes model takes into consideration the exercise price and expected life of the options  the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility  the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option 
for grants subject to a market condition  the corporation utilizes a monte carlo simulation to estimate the fair value and determine the derived service period 
compensation is recognized over the derived service period with any unrecognized compensation cost immediately recognized when the market condition is met 
the corporation s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested 
in accordance with sfas r  the corporation estimates the number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
prior to january   the corporation followed sfas and apb with pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas had been applied 
unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from independent valuation services and brokers 
in developing these fair values  the valuation services and brokers use estimates of cash flows based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar rate environments 
debt securities available for sale are mostly comprised of mortgage backed securities as well as tax exempt municipal bonds and us government agency securities 
the corporation uses various indicators in determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired  including for equity securities  if the market value is below its cost for an extended period of time with low expectation of recovery or for debt securities  when it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected 
the debt securities are monitored for changes in credit ratings 
adverse changes in credit ratings would affect the estimated cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer 
the unrealized losses associated with the securities portfolio  that management has the ability and intent to hold  are not considered to be other than temporary as of december  because the unrealized losses are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral or issuer 
the corporation recognized an other than temporary charge of  during the third quarter of as a result of an equity holding in a financial institution which was purchased by another institution at a lower than cost share price 
in conjunction with the closing of the merger during the fourth quarter of  the corporation exchanged its equity holding in the financial institution for cash 
deferred taxes the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realizations are likely 
if management determines that the corporation may not be able to realize some or all of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the value of the net deferred tax asset to the expected realizable value 
the corporation has not substantively changed its application of the foregoing policies  and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques used as compared to prior periods

investment securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that debt and equity securities classified as available for sale be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
the net effect of unrealized gains or losses  caused by marking an available for sale portfolio to market  causes fluctuations in the level of shareholders equity and equity related financial ratios as market interest rates cause the fair value of fixed rate securities to fluctuate 
investment securities increased to million at december  from million at december  the investment securities available for sale increased million and the investment securities held to maturity decreased million 
the majority of the increase in available for sale securities is due to the securities acquired from east penn financial of million at november  during  million of securities available for sale were sold which generated a pre tax gain of million

loans loans increased million in the acquisition of east penn financial accounted for million as of november  organic growth was approximately million  or 
at the acquisition date  east penn financial included million in real estate loans  million in commercial loans  and million in consumer loans 
the growth in commercial loans and real estate loans was mainly due to the emphasis on owner operated businesses and owner occupied commercial mortgage loans in its primary market 
the growth in consumer loans was mainly due to marketing efforts 
in addition  there was also a shift from variable rate home equity lines to fixed rate  fixed payment home equity loans 
the planned reduction in lease financing was due to run off 
one of the bank s strategic objectives is to increase its loan to deposit ratio by growing its loan portfolio at a faster pace than its deposits 
loans increased million  or in  primarily attributed to growth in commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans

the bank had no foreign loans  and the impact of nonaccrual and delinquent loans on total interest income was not material 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans that are in nonaccrual status or days or more past due and loans that are in the process of foreclosure 
a loan is generally classified as nonaccrual when principal or interest has consistently been in default for a period of days or more  when there has been deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  or payment in full of principal or interest is not expected 
delinquent loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and expected to be restored to a current status in the near future 
nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due and net assets in foreclosure were of total assets at december   compared to at december  and at december  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total net loans was at december   compared to at december  and at december  nonaccruing loans increased million to million at december   as compared to december  the higher level of nonaccruing loans was mainly due to an increase in nonaccrual commercial construction  home equity revolving and installment loans during offset by a decrease in non accrual commercial mortgages 
nonaccruing loans increased million to million at december   as compared to december  the increase in nonaccruing loans was principally due to an increase in non accrual commercial mortgage loans during the bank s policy for interest income recognition on nonaccrual loans is to recognize income under the cash basis when the loans are both current and the collateral on the loan is sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation to the bank 
the bank will not recognize income if these factors do not exist 
during  interest accrued on nonaccruing loans and not recognized as interest income was  and interest paid on nonaccruing loans of  was recognized as interest income 
during  interest accrued on nonaccruing loans and not recognized as interest income was  and interest paid on nonaccruing loans of  was recognized as interest income 
during  interest accrued on nonaccruing loans and not recognized as interest income was  and interest paid on nonaccruing loans of  was recognized as interest income 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are loans that are generally well secured and are in the process of collection 
as of december   loans past due days or more and still accruing interest were  compared to million at december  and  at december  the lower level of loans past due days or more at december  from december  was primarily in the commercial loans  commercial mortgages  home equity revolving lines and home equity installment loans 
the higher level of loans past due days or more at december  compared to december  was primarily in the commercial and residential real estate loan portfolio 
the expectation of continued economic pressures resulting in deterioration of credit quality has caused us to provide more resources to resolve troubled credits including an increased focus on earlier identification of potential problem loans and a more active approach to managing the level of criticized loans that have not reached nonaccrual status 
net assets in foreclosure at december  were  there were no net assets in foreclosure at december  and  at december  efforts to liquidate assets acquired in foreclosure proceed as quickly as potential buyers can be located and legal constraints permit 
foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost lesser of carrying value of the asset or fair value at date of acquisition or estimated fair value

allowance for loan losses the corporation uses the reserve method of accounting for loan losses 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
while management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and management s intent with regard to the disposition of loans 
in addition  the occ  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically reviews the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require the corporation to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the corporation performs periodic evaluations of the allowance for loan losses that include both historical  internal and external factors 
the actual allocation of reserve is a function of the application of these factors to arrive at a reserve for each portfolio type 
management assigns credit ratings and individual factors to individual groups of loans 
changes in concentrations and quality are captured in the analytical metrics used in the calculation of the reserve 
the components of the allowance for credit losses consist of both historical losses and estimates 
management bases its recognition and estimation of each allowance component on certain observable data that it believes is the most reflective of the underlying loan losses being estimated 
the observable data and accompanying analysis is directionally consistent  based upon trends  with the resulting component amount for the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses components includes the following historical loss estimation by loan product type and by risk rating within each product type  payment past due status  industry concentrations  internal and external variables such as economic conditions  credit policy and underwriting changes and results of the loan review process 
the corporation s historical loss component is the most significant component of the allowance for loan losses  and all other allowance components are based on the inherent loss attributes that management believes exist within the total portfolio that are not captured in the historical loss component 
the historical loss components of the allowance represent the results of analyses of historical charge offs and recoveries within pools of homogeneous loans  within each risk rating and broken down further by segment  within the portfolio 
criticized assets are further assessed based on trends  expressed as percentages  relative to delinquency  risk rating and nonaccrual  by credit product 
the historical loss components of the allowance for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans collectively commercial loans are based principally on current risk ratings  historical loss rates adjusted  by adjusting the risk window  to reflect current events and conditions  as well as analyses of other factors that may have affected the collectibility of loans 
all commercial loans with an outstanding balance over  are subject to review on an annual basis 
samples of commercial loans with a pass rating are individually reviewed annually 
commercial loans that management determines to be potential problem loans are individually reviewed at a minimum annually 
the review is accomplished via watchlist memorandum  and is designed to determine whether such loans are individually impaired  with impairment measured by reference to the collateral coverage and or debt service coverage 
consumer credit and residential real estate reviews are limited to those loans reflecting delinquent payment status 
homogeneous loan pools  including consumer and family residential mortgages are not subject to individual review but are evaluated utilizing risk factors such as concentration of one borrower group 
the historical loss component of the allowance for these loans is based principally on loan payment status  retail classification and historical loss rates  adjusted by altering the risk window  to reflect current events and conditions 
the industry concentration component is recognized as a possible factor in the estimation of loan losses 
two industries represent possible concentrations commercial real estate and consumer loans relying on residential home equity 
no specific loss related observable data is recognized by management currently  therefore no specific factor is calculated in the reserve solely for the impact of these concentrations  although management continues to carefully consider relevant data for possible future sources of observable data 
the historic loss model includes a judgmental component environmental factors that reflects management s belief that there are additional inherent credit losses based on loss attributes not adequately captured in the lagging indicators 
the environmental factors are based upon management s review of trends in the corporation s primary market area as well as regional and national economic trends 
management utilizes various economic factors that could impact borrowers future ability to make loan payments such as changes in the interest rate environment  product supply shortages and negative industry specific events 
management utilizes relevant articles from newspapers and other publications that describe the economic events affecting specific geographic areas and other published economic reports and data 
furthermore  given that past performance indicators may not adequately capture current risk levels  allowing for a real time adjustment enhances the validity of the loss recognition process 
there are many credit risk management reports that are synthesized by credit risk management staff to assess the direction of credit risk and its instant effect on losses 
it is important to continue to use experiential data to confirm risk as measurable losses will continue to manifest themselves at higher than normal levels even after the economic cycle has begun an upward swing and lagging indicators begin to show improvement 
the judgmental component is allocated to the specific segments of the portfolio based on the historic loss component 
the provision for loan losses increased million during compared to mostly as a result of a decrease in the quality of the loan portfolio which caused an increase in the amount of the required reserve 
net loans charged off increased million for compared to principally from charge offs related to real estate construction loans for one borrower which were disposed of subsequent to september  through a sale of the collateral and four unrelated commercial and industrial loans 
the profile of our customer base has remained relatively constant and we believe that the current deterioration in credit quality has been caused by the economic pressures being felt by our borrowers 
we have experienced a similar decline in the past and expect that we could experience a similar decline in future economic cycles 
the provision for loan losses for reflected an increase of  compared to the primarily due to inherent risk related to loan growth and the increase in non performing loans of million 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  as compared to december  the increase in the allowance was primarily due to the addition of the east penn financial loan loss reserve in november as well as the inherent risk related to loan growth and the increase in nonperforming loans of million 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  from december  the increase in the allowance was mainly due to inherent risk related to loan growth and the increase in nonperforming loans of million

the allocation of the allowance for real estate loans at december  increased million as compared to december  principally due to an increase in criticized real estate construction loans including a loan for one borrower totaling million 
the loan is part of a syndicated credit for a local borrower that has been negatively affected by a decline in home sales 
the allocation of the allowance for commercial and industrial loans at december  increased million from december  mostly due to an increase in commercial loan volume from the east penn financial acquisition 
in addition  the allocation of the allowance for consumer loans at december  increased  primarily due to the increased level of consumer loans related to the east penn acquisition 
there was no material changes in the allocation of the allowance for lease financing at december  compared to december  there were no significant changes in the estimation methods and assumptions including environmental factors  loan concentrations or terms that impacted the allowance during the interest rate environment as well as weakening in the commercial real estate market has moderately increased our allowance allocation in concert with the historical trends 
it is expected that the negative trends in the real estate industry will continue to affect credit quality for the remainder of and into the growth in the loan portfolio and the change in the mix will result in an adjustment to the amount of the allowance allocated to each category based upon historical loss trends and other factors 
the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by category

net interest income on a tax equivalent basis in decreased million  or to million  in comparison to the decrease in was mostly due to higher deposit rates  partially offset by higher loan rates and loan volume 
the rate volume analysis in the following table  which is computed on a tax equivalent basis tax rate of  analyzes changes in net interest income for the last three years by their volume and rate components 
the change attributable to both volume and rate has been allocated proportionately

nonaccrual loans have been included in the appropriate average loan balance category  but interest on nonaccrual loans has not been included for purposes of determining interest income 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis in increased million  or to million  in comparison to the increase was primarily due to higher average loans of million  or  and a basis point rise in the average rates earned on loans 
the growth in average loans during was mainly attributable to higher levels of new commercial and industrial originations and real estate loan originations  including both construction and consumer and loans acquired from east penn financial  partially offset by a lower level of real estate refinancing loans due to the higher interest rate environment 
the average yield on investments also increased basis points 
interest expense increased million  to million during mostly attributed to higher deposit rates and an increase in average deposits of million 
the average rate paid on deposits during of was basis points higher compared to primarily due to higher rates on money market accounts  interest checking accounts and time deposits accounts 
the increase in average deposits was mostly from growth in interest bearing checking and money market accounts as well as deposits acquired from east penn financial partially offset by reductions in savings accounts 
the corporation has placed more emphasis on lower rate deposit products in an effort to improve the net interest margin 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis in increased million  or to million  as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher average loans of million  or  and a basis point rise in the average rates earned on loans 
the average yield on investments also increased basis points 
interest expense increased million  to million during mostly attributed to higher deposit and borrowing rates 
the average rate paid on deposits during of was basis points higher compared to primarily due to higher rates on most deposit products 
these higher rates resulted from the continued increase in short term rates during the average rate paid on borrowings for of was basis points higher than mainly due to an increase in short term borrowing rates 
net interest margin the net interest margin of was lower than the net interest margins for and of and  respectively 
the decline in the net interest margin during and was mainly attributable to the increased customer deposit costs which outpaced yield increases in loans and investments 
during  the corporation continued to manage its balance sheet in an effort to position it for the inverted yield curve and subsequent falling rates scenario 
the corporation sold securities with lower fixed rates and longer average lives and purchased securities with higher yields to take advantage of specific market sectors and more stable cash flows 
as a result  the balance sheet is better positioned to mitigate market risk

interest rate sensitivity analysis in the normal course of conducting business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risk  principally interest rate risk  through the operations of its banking subsidiary 
interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that affect cash flows  income  expense and value of financial instruments 
the corporation actively manages its interest rate sensitivity positions 
the objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve consistent growth in net interest income 
the asset liability committee  using policies and procedures approved by the corporation s board of directors  is responsible for managing the rate sensitivity position 
the corporation manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix and repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities through the management of its investment securities portfolio  its offering of loan and deposit terms and through wholesale borrowings from several providers  but primarily from the federal home loan bank 
the nature of the corporation s current operations is such that it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the corporation only utilizes derivative instruments for asset liability management 
these transactions involve both credit and market risk 
the notional amounts are amounts on which calculations and payments are based 
the notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures 
direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid  if any 
interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rate flows fixed and floating are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amounts on which the interest payments are based are not exchanged 
interest rate caps are purchased contracts that limit the exposure from the repricing of liabilities in a rising rate environment 
at december   the corporation had cash flow hedges in the form of interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that have the effect of converting the rates on money market deposit accounts to a fixed rate cost of funds 
this strategy will cause the bank to recognize  in a rising rate environment  a larger interest rate spread than it otherwise would have without the swaps in effect 
in addition  the corporation had cash flow hedges with a notional amount of million that have the effect of converting variable debt to a fixed rate 
for these swaps  the corporation recognized net interest income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively and estimates that for   will be recognized as a decrease in net interest income 
these swaps mature in during the first quarter of  the corporation terminated a cash flow hedge with a notional value of million 
the gross loss related to the termination of this swap was  which was amortized through october in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for the years ended december  and  the corporation amortized into net interest income  and  respectively related to this swap 
periodically  the corporation may enter into fair value hedges to limit the exposure to changes in the fair value of loan assets 
at december   the corporation had fair value hedges in the form of interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
these swaps mature in the corporation recognized net interest income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  which includes  for related to two terminated swaps with notional amounts totaling million that were terminated during at december   the corporation had swap agreements with a positive fair value of  and with a negative fair value of  at december   the corporation had swap agreements with a positive fair value of  and with a negative fair value of  there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized during  and during march  the corporation purchased one and three month treasury bill interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling million to limit its exposure on variable rate now deposit accounts 
the initial premium related to these caps was  which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the cap based on the cap market value 
the corporation recognized amortization of  for the year ended december  and estimates that for   will be recognized as interest expense 
at december   these caps  designated as cash flow hedges  had a positive fair value of the caps mature in march during  the corporation accelerated the reclassification of an immaterial amount in other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of variable rate interest payments becoming probable not to occur 
the accelerated amount was a loss of  recognized in interest expense 
the corporation uses three principal reports to measure interest rate risk asset liability simulation reports  gap analysis reports  and net interest margin reports 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  as measured by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december   is presented in the following table 
the data in the table was based in part on assumptions that are regularly reviewed for accuracy 
the table presents data at a single point in time and includes management assumptions estimating the prepayment rate and the interest rate environment prevailing at december  the table indicates a liability sensitive one year cumulative gap position of of total earning assets 
table contractual repricing data of interest sensitive assets and liabilities december  after year to to through over days days years years total dollars in thousands earning assets investment securities    federal funds sold and deposits in banks   loans      total earning assets     interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking accounts    money market funds     savings accounts     time deposits     borrowed funds      total interest bearing liabilities    interest rate swaps    incremental gap     cumulative gap     cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets the information is based upon significant assumptions  including the following loans and leases are repaid by contractual maturity and repricing  securities  except mortgage backed securities  are repaid according to contractual maturity adjusted for call features  mortgage backed security repricing is adjusted for estimated early paydowns  interest bearing demand  regular savings  and money market savings deposits are estimated to exhibit some rate sensitivity based on management s analysis of deposit withdrawals  and time deposits are shown in the table based on contractual maturity 
management also simulates possible economic conditions and interest rate scenarios in order to quantify the impact on net interest income 
the effect that changing interest rates have on the corporation s net interest income is simulated by increasing and decreasing interest rates 
this simulation is known as rate shocking 
the results of the december  net interest income rate shock simulations show that the corporation is within guidelines set by the corporation s asset liability policy when rates increase or decrease or basis points 
the following table forecasts changes in the corporation s market value of equity under alternative interest rate environments as of december  the market value of equity is defined as the net present value of the corporation s existing assets and liabilities 
the corporation is within guidelines set by the corporation s asset liability policy for the percentage change in the market value of equity 
table market value of equity december  asset liability change in approved market value market value percentage percent of equity of equity change change dollars in thousands basis points   basis points   basis points   flat rate  basis points   basis points   basis points   in the event the corporation should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its market value of equity resulting from changes in interest rates  it has a number of options that it could use to remedy the mismatch 
the corporation could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize growth in loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased million during compared to mostly as a result of decreased quality of the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses for reflected an increase of  compared to the primarily due to inherent risk related to loan growth and the increase in non performing loans of million 
total net loans charged off in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
noninterest income for the year ended december   noninterest income was million  a decrease of million or from wealth management fee income rose million or during primarily driven by a higher level of life insurance business at cornerstone as well as growth in trust assets 
major revenue component sources of wealth management income include investment management and advisory fees  trust fees  estate and tax planning fees  brokerage fees  and insurance related fees 
the bank experienced an increase in deposit service charges of million or over the prior year mainly from return check and overdraft fees and fees from east penn deposit accounts 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale leaseback of fifteen bank properties representing a portion of the total gain of million 
the remaining gain will be deferred and amortized through a reduction of occupancy expense over the year term of the leases an annual amount of approximately million 
the corporation also completed a separate sale leaseback of office space in october with a recognized pre tax gain of  the deferred gain of  will be amortized over the year term of the lease 
in addition  gains on sale of investment securities were million during as compared to losses of  for the net security gains during were primarily the result of the sale of bullet and callable agency  tax exempt municipal and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  noninterest income for included the pre tax gains on the sales of the bank s honesdale branch and credit card portfolio of million and million  respectively 
noninterest income of million during increased million compared to during  the bank recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale of its honesdale branch 
the sale of this single wayne county location included million in deposits  as well as approximately million in loans and other assets  and resulted in a net cash payment of million 
the acquisition of the cornerstone companies was the primary driver of increases in wealth management income of million for the year of over  partially offset by the sale of cumberland advisors  which was divested in in addition  noninterest income for included the pre tax gain of million on the sale of the bank s million credit card portfolio as well as increases in fee revenue resulting from credit card operations 
losses on sales of investment securities for were  as compared to gains of million for noninterest income for included the gains of  and  on the sales of harleysville national bank s mcadoo branch and cumberland advisors  inc  respectively 
noninterest expense noninterest expense of million for the year ended december  increased million or in comparison to salaries and benefits expense rose million during from the previous year  primarily due to higher staffing levels resulting from new branch openings and the east penn financial acquisition and higher costs of medical benefits 
occupancy expense increased million for the year ended december   over mostly due to several new office locations including the new operations center building in harleysville and four new branch openings as well as the addition of the east penn branches 
other expense increased million during mainly as a result of the one time pre tax charge of million related to the pension plan curtailment  increased professional and consulting expense as well as east penn merger costs of approximately  and lower deferred loan origination costs resulting from lower loan volume 
noninterest expense of million during increased million compared to salaries and benefits expense rose million for the year of over  primarily related to the acquisition of the cornerstone companies  partially offset by the sale of cumberland advisors in the second quarter of  higher staffing levels resulting from growth  increased incentives  non recurring compensation and severance charges primarily related to the former chief executive officer s contract  and compensation expense of  resulting from recording the corporation s stock option expense in conformance with fas r  stock based compensation 
occupancy expense increased  in over mostly due to the cornerstone companies acquisition and a new branch opening 
other expense increased million during mainly as a result of the cornerstone companies acquisition including amortization of intangible assets of  partially offset by decreased marketing expenses during income taxes the effective income tax rates for  and were  and were less than the applicable federal statutory rate of 
the corporation s effective rates were lower than the statutory tax rate primarily as a result of tax exempt income earned from state and municipal securities and loans and bank owned life insurance  as well as for  the non taxable gain on the sale of cumberland advisors  inc the effective tax rate for was lower than and primarily due to the lower level of net income during capital capital formation is important to the corporation s well being and future growth 
capital  at the end of  was million  an increase of million over the end of the increase was mainly due to the issuance of million in common stock in connection with the acquisition of east penn financial 
at december   capital was million  an increase of million over december  the increase was primarily the result of the retention of the corporation s earnings and issuances of stock for stock options including tax benefits partially offset by dividends paid to the shareholders 
management believes that the corporation s current capital position and liquidity position are strong and that its capital position is adequate to support its operations 
management is not aware of any recommendation by any regulatory authority  which  if it were to be implemented  would have a material effect on the corporation s capital 
pursuant to the federal regulators risk based capital adequacy guidelines  the components of capital are called tier and tier capital 
for the corporation  tier capital is generally common stockholder s equity and retained earnings adjusted to exclude disallowed goodwill and identifiable intangibles as well as the inclusion of qualifying trust preferred securities 
tier capital for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses 
the risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing the components of capital by risk adjusted assets 
risk adjusted assets are determined by assigning credit risk weighting factors from to to various categories of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the minimum for the tier capital ratio is  and the total capital ratio tier plus tier capital divided by risk adjusted assets minimum is 
at december   the corporation s tier risk adjusted capital ratio was  and the total risk adjusted capital ratio was  both well above regulatory requirements 
the risk based capital ratios of the bank also exceeded regulatory requirements at the end of at december   the corporation s tier risk adjusted capital ratio was  and the total risk adjusted capital ratio was 
the lower risk based capital ratios of the corporation at december  compared to december  were primarily attributable to the increase in risk weighted assets from the acquisition of east penn financial in november and due to an increase in loans and federal funds sold 
to supplement the risk based capital adequacy guidelines  the federal reserve board frb established a leverage ratio guideline 
the leverage ratio consists of tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets  excluding goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
the minimum leverage ratio guideline is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and that have well diversified risk  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and  in general  are considered top rated  strong banking organizations 
other banking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least or  depending upon their particular condition and growth plans 
higher leverage ratios could be required by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
the corporation s leverage ratios were and at december  and  respectively 
the lower leverage ratio of the corporation at december  was mainly due to an increase in average assets from the acquisition of east penn financial and increases in average loans and average federal funds sold 
under fdic regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
to be considered adequately capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
an institution is deemed to be critically under capitalized if it has a tangible equity ratio of or less 
as of december   the bank is above the regulatory minimum guidelines and meets the criteria to be categorized as a well capitalized institution 
the cash dividends paid during of 
per share was higher than the cash dividends in of 
the proportion of net income paid out in dividends for was  compared to for  the increase mainly resulting from lower net income during the dividend payout ratios are in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
management is focusing on improving and increasing earnings so that the dividend payout ratio remains within acceptable limits 
activity in both the corporation s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan did not have a material impact on capital during liquidity liquidity is a measure of the ability of the corporation to meet its current cash needs and obligations on a timely basis 
for a bank  liquidity provides the means to meet the day to day demands of deposit customers and the needs of borrowing customers 
generally  the bank arranges its mix of cash  money market investments  investment securities and loans in order to match the volatility  seasonality  interest sensitivity and growth trends of its deposit funds 
the corporation s decisions with regard to liquidity are based on the projections of potential sources and uses of funds for the next days under the corporation s asset liability model 
the resulting projections as of december   show the potential sources of funds exceeding the potential uses of funds 
the accuracy of this prediction can be affected by limitations inherent in the model and by the occurrence of future events not anticipated when the projections were made 
the corporation has external sources of funds which can be drawn upon when funds are required 
one source of external liquidity is the available line of credit with the fhlb 
as of december   the bank had borrowings outstanding with the fhlb of million  all of which were long term 
at december   the bank had unused lines of credit at the fhlb of million and unused federal funds lines of credit of million 
in addition  the corporation s funding sources include investment and loan portfolio cash flows  fed funds sold and short term investments  as well as access to the brokered certificate of deposit market and repurchase agreement borrowings 
the corporation has pledged available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of million and held to maturity securities of million 
the corporation could also increase its liquidity through its pricing on certificates of deposit products 
the corporation believes it has adequate funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying business conditions 
there are no known trends or any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in  or that are reasonably likely to result in liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way although a significant portion of the corporation s time deposits mature in given the anticipated low rate environment for much of  we expect to be able to retain most of these deposits 
in the event that additional funds are required  the corporation believes its short term liquidity is adequate as outlined above 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  table contractual obligations and other commitments december  after one after three one year or year through years through after five total less three years five years years dollars in thousands minimum annual operating leases    remaining contractual maturities of time deposits   long term borrowings      subordinated debt   unfunded home equity lines of credit     unfunded other loan lines of credit     unfunded residential mortgages   standby letters of credit     total      home equity lines of credit in the after five years category have no stated expiration 
the bank also had commitments with customers to extend mortgage loans at a specified rate at december  and december  of million and million  respectively and commitments to sell mortgage loans at a specified rate at december  and december  of million and  respectively 
the commitments are accounted for as a derivative and recorded at fair value 
the bank estimates the fair value of these commitments by comparing the secondary market price at the reporting date to the price specified in the contract to extend or sell the loan initiated at the time of the loan commitment 
at december   the corporation had commitments with a positive fair value of  and negative fair value of  which was recorded as other income 
at december   the corporation had commitments with a positive fair value of  and a negative fair value of  during april  the bank sold its existing credit card portfolio of million 
the sale agreement stipulated that any credit card accounts delinquent over days  overlimit accounts and petitioned bankruptcies would be guaranteed by the bank for a period of one year 
of the million in credit card receivables sold   was sold with full recourse which was the total potential recourse exposure at the time of the sale 
during the second quarter of  the bank recorded a recourse liability of  which was the entire recourse liability recorded 
this estimate was based on our historic losses as experienced on similar credit card receivables 
the bank was subject to the full recourse obligations for a period of one year 
at june   the total potential recourse exposure was reduced to with the expiration of the one year recourse period 
the corporation s actual loss experience approximated the initial reserve 
during january  the bank completed its acquisition of the cornerstone companies 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash paid at closing and a contingent payment of up to million to be paid post closing 
the contingent payment is based upon the cornerstone companies meeting certain minimum operating results during a five year earn out period with a maximum payout of million over this period 
for and  the minimum operating results were met resulting in earn out payments totaling million which was recorded as additional goodwill 
at december   the remaining maximum payout is million through during december and january  the bank sold lease financing receivables of million 
of these leases  million were sold with full recourse and the remaining leases were sold subject to recourse with a maximum exposure of ten percent of the outstanding receivable 
the total recourse exposure at the time of the sale of the leases was million 
during the first quarter of  the bank recorded a recourse liability of  which was the entire recourse liability recorded 
this estimate was based on our historic losses as experienced on similar lease financing receivables 
after the first anniversary of the sale agreement  and on a quarterly basis thereafter  upon written request by the bank  the purchaser will review the portfolio performance and may reduce the total exposure to an amount equal to ten percent of the outstanding net book value 
the bank will be subject to the full and partial recourse obligations until all the lease financing receivables have been paid or otherwise been terminated and all equipment has been sold or disposed of 
the final lease payment is due in the outstanding balance of these sold leases at december  was million with a total recourse exposure of  and a current recourse liability of  for information on known uncertainties  see item  business 
fourth quarter results unaudited net income for the fourth quarter of was million or per diluted share  as compared to million or per diluted share for the fourth quarter of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of increased million  or  from the same period in this increase was mainly attributable to higher net earning assets from the east penn financial acquisition effective november  and lower interest bearing checking and money market deposit costs 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of of remained flat as compared to for the fourth quarter of noninterest income of million for the fourth quarter of decreased million from the comparable period in fourth quarter growth  however  was achieved over in wealth management fee income and service charges on deposits 
wealth management fee income rose million or primarily driven by a higher level of life insurance business at cornerstone as well as growth in trust assets 
service charges on deposits increased  or mainly from return check and overdraft fees and fees from east penn deposit accounts 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation recognized gains from sale leaseback transactions of million and from sales of investment securities of  while during the corporation recognized a gain on the sale of the honesdale branch of million and a loss on sale of investment securities of  noninterest expense of million for the fourth quarter of increased million from the same period in salaries and benefits expense rose million during the fourth quarter of from the comparable period in  primarily related to higher staffing levels resulting from new branch openings and the east penn acquisition 
in addition  occupancy expense increased due to several new office locations including the new operations center building in harleysville and four new branch openings as well as the addition of the east penn branches 
other expenses increased mostly due to a one time pre tax charge of million related to the pension plan curtailment  merger expenses of  and increased professional and consulting fees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of conducting business activities  the corporation is exposed to market risk  principally interest risk  through the operations of its banking subsidiary 
interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that affect cash flows  income  expense and values of financial instruments 
the asset liability committee of the corporation  using policies and procedures approved by the bank s board of directors  is responsible for managing the rate sensitivity position 
during the fourth quarter of  the economy has experienced a continued decline in the housing market  reductions in credit facilities  rising food and energy prices  all resulting in short term rate reductions by the federal open market committee 
this has created a challenging interest rate environment for the corporation which has impacted our interest rate sensitivity exposure
