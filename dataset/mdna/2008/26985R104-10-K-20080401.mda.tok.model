item selected financial data 
the following table shows selected historical financial data of our predecessor  oneok texas field services lp and eagle rock pipeline  lp and eagle rock energy partners  lp oneok texas field services  lp is treated as our and eagle rock pipeline  lp s predecessor and is referred to as eagle rock predecessor throughout this report because of the substantial size of the operations of oneok texas field services  lp as compared to eagle rock pipeline  lp and the fact that all of eagle rock pipeline  lp s operations at the time of the acquisition of oneok texas field services  lp related to an investment that was managed and operated by others 
references in this report to eagle rock pipeline refer to eagle rock pipeline  lp  which is the acquirer of eagle rock predecessor and the entity contributed to eagle rock energy partners  lp in connection with our initial public offering 
our historical results of operations for the periods presented below may not be comparable either from period to period or going forward  for the following reasons on december   eagle rock pipeline commenced operations by acquiring the dry trail plant from williams field service company for approximately million  and in july  eagle rock pipeline sold the dry trail plant to celero energy  lp for approximately million  resulting in a pre tax realized gain in the disposition of approximately million in the dry trail operations are reflected as discontinued operations for eagle rock pipeline for and the purchase price paid in connection with the acquisition of eagle rock predecessor on december  was pushed down to the financial statements of eagle rock energy partners  lp as a result of this push down accounting  the book basis of our assets was increased to reflect the purchase price  which had the effect of increasing our depreciation expense 
in connection with our acquisition of the eagle rock predecessor  our interest expense subsequent to december  increased due to the increased debt incurred 
after our acquisition of eagle rock predecessor  we initiated a risk management program comprised of ngl puts  costless collars and swaps  crude costless collars and natural gas calls  as well as interest rate swaps that we accounted for using mark to market accounting

non gaap financial measures we include in this filing the following non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda as defined on page 
we provide reconciliations of this non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measures as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes or depreciation and amortization expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate net income 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is important to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our liquidity 
our adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and operating income and these measures may vary among companies 
therefore  our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a growth oriented publicly traded delaware limited partnership engaged in the following three businesses midstream business gathering  compressing  treating  processing  transporting and selling natural gas  fractionating and transporting natural gas liquids  or ngls  upstream business acquiring  developing and producing oil and natural gas property interests  and minerals business acquiring and managing fee minerals and royalty interests 
we report on our businesses in six accounting segments 
we conduct  evaluate and report on our midstream business within three distinct segments the texas panhandle segment  the east texas louisiana segment formerly referred to by us in prior filings and records as our southeast texas and north louisiana segment  and south texas segment 
our texas panhandle segment consists of gathering and processing assets in the texas panhandle 
our east texas louisiana segment consists of gathering and processing assets in east texas louisiana 
our south texas segment consists of gathering systems and related compression and processing facilities in south texas 
we conduct  evaluate and report on our upstream business as one segment 
our upstream segment includes operated wells in escambia county  alabama and two treating facilities  one natural gas processing plant and related gathering systems that are inextricably intertwined with ownership and operation of the wells 
the upstream segment also includes operated and non operated wells that are primarily located in east and south texas in rains  van zandt  henderson and atascosa counties 
we conduct  evaluate and report on our minerals business as one segment 
our minerals segment consists of certain fee minerals  royalties  overriding royalties and non operated working interest properties  located in multiple producing trends across the united states  and interests in mineral acres and wells 
the final segment that we report on is our corporate segment  which is where we account for our commodity derivative hedging activity and our general and administrative expenses 
we have an experienced management team dedicated to growing  operating and maximizing the profitability of our assets 
our management team is experienced in gathering and processing natural gas  operation of oil and natural gas properties and assets  and management of royalties and minerals 
acquisitions historically  we have grown through acquisitions 
during  we grew by  based on gross revenues  excluding unrealized commodity derivative impact  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  with the montierra acquisition  described below  completed in the second quarter of  we expanded our business from solely a midstream company to an upstream minerals company as well 
with our redman and eac acquisitions  described below  we further expanded our presence in the upstream business by adding operator working interests as well as other oil and natural gas interests and properties 

table of contents 
index to financial statements going forward in and beyond  we will continue to assess acquisition opportunities  regardless of whether such opportunity is in the midstream  upstream  or minerals business  for their potential accretive value 
our ability to complete acquisitions will depend on our ability to finance the acquisitions  either through the issuance of additional securities  debt or equity  or the incurrence of additional debt under our credit facilities  on terms acceptable to us 
below is a summary of our important acquisition transactions completed during montierra acquisition on april   we completed the acquisition of by direct acquisition or acquisition of certain entities certain fee minerals  royalties and working interest properties from montierra minerals production  lp and ngp vii income co investment opportunities  lp the montierra acquisition

presentation of financial information for a description of the presentation of our financial information in this report  please see item selected financial data 
critical accounting policies conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
on an on going basis  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments based on management s best available knowledge of previous  current  and expected future events 
given that a substantial portion of our operations were acquired within the past to months  we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and estimates are subject to change due to modifications in the underlying conditions or assumptions 
currently  we do not foresee any reasonably likely changes to our current estimates and assumptions which would materially affect amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we have selected the following critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations for discussion 
successful efforts 
we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
leasehold costs are capitalized when incurred 
costs incurred to drill and complete development wells  including dry holes  are capitalized 
unproved properties are assessed periodically within specific geographic areas and  if necessary  impairments are charged to expense 
geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
we carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well finds a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its capitalization as a producing well as long as we are making sufficient progress towards assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
depletion of producing oil and natural gas properties is recorded based on units of production 
unit rates are computed for unamortized drilling and development costs using proved developed reserves and for acquisition costs using all proved reserves 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting for oil and gas producing companies requires that acquisition costs of proved properties be amortized on the basis of all proved reserves  developed and undeveloped and that capitalized development costs wells and related equipment and facilities be amortized on the basis of proved developed reserves 
upon sale or retirement of complete fields of depreciable or depleted property  the book value thereof  less proceeds or salvage value  is charged or credited to income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess proved oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be pre tax recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted pre tax future cash flows from a property are less than the carrying value 
if an impairment is indicated  the fair value is compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record 
estimated future cash flows are based on management s expectations for the future and include estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs 
downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment 
during the year ended december   we incurred an impairment charge in our minerals segment of million as a result of steeper decline rates in certain fields 

table of contents 
index to financial statements unproved properties that are individually insignificant are amortized 
unproved properties that are individually significant are assessed for impairment on a property by property basis 
if considered impaired  costs are charged to expense when such impairment is deemed to have occurred 
our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic conditions 
annually  and on other occasions  cawley  gillespie associates  inc prepares an estimate of the proved reserves on all our properties  based on information provided by us 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
we prepare our reserve estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines 
the independent engineering firm described above adheres to the same guidelines when preparing their reserve reports 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil eventually recovered 
revenue and cost of sales recognition 
we record revenue and cost of sales on the gross basis for those transactions where we act as the principal and take title to natural gas  ngls or condensates that is purchased for resale 
when our customers pay us a fee for providing a service such as gathering  treating or transportation we record the fees separately in revenues 
we currently record the monthly results of operations using primarily actual results which include settling most of our volumes with producers  shippers and customers around the th of the month following the production month 
this process results in us reporting later than other similar partnerships that report on estimates 
risk management activities 
we have structured our hedging activities in order to minimize our commodity pricing and interest rate risks 
these hedging activities rely upon forecasts of our expected operations and financial structure over the next five years 
if our operations or financial structure are significantly different from these forecasts  we could be subject to adverse financial results as a result of these hedging activities 
we mitigate this potential exposure by retaining an operational cushion between our forecasted transactions and the level of hedging activity executed 
from the inception of our hedging program  we used mark to market accounting for our commodity hedges and interest rate swaps 
there were no derivatives for the periods before september  we record monthly realized gains and losses on hedge instruments based upon cash settlements information 
the settlement amounts vary due to the volatility in the commodity market prices throughout each month 
we also record unrealized gains and losses monthly based upon the future value on mark to market hedges through their expiration dates 
the expiration dates vary but are currently no later than january for our interest rate hedges  and december for our commodity hedges 
the option premium costs we incurred as part of our panhandle acquisition are being expensed through the unrealized risk management instruments in total revenue 
we monitor and review hedging positions regularly 

table of contents 
index to financial statements depreciation and depletion expense and cost capitalization policies 
our midstream assets consist primarily of natural gas gathering pipelines and processing plants 
we capitalize all construction related direct labor and material costs  as well as indirect construction costs 
indirect construction costs include general engineering and the costs of funds used in construction 
the cost of funds used in construction represents capitalized interest 
these costs are then expensed over the life of the constructed asset through the recording of depreciation expense 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  depreciation of our midstream assets is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
the costs of renewals and betterments which extend the useful life of property  plant and equipment are also capitalized 
the costs of repairs  replacements and maintenance projects are expensed as incurred 
the computation of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage value of assets 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates are reviewed to determine if any changes are needed 
such changes could involve an increase or decrease in estimated useful lives or salvage values which would impact future depreciation expense 
impairment of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets for impairment based on sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
a long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying amount may exceed its fair value 
fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
examples of long lived asset impairment indicators include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator which would exclude allowable costs from the rate making process  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
environmental remediation 
current accounting guidelines require us to recognize a liability and expense associated with environmental remediation if i government agencies mandate such activities or one of our properties were added to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla database  ii the existence of a liability is probable and iii the amount can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we have recorded a million liability for remediation expenditures 
if governmental regulations change  we could be required to incur additional remediation costs which may have a material impact on our profitability 
asset retirement obligations 
eagle rock has recorded liabilities of million for future asset retirement obligations in its midstream and upstream operations 
related accretion expense has been recorded in operating expenses see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
we view these measurements as important factors affecting our profitability and review these measurements on a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis 
these measures include volumes  margin  operating expenses and adjusted ebitda on a company wide basis 
volumes by operational segments midstream volumes 
in our midstream business  we must continually obtain new supplies of natural gas to maintain or increase throughput volumes on our gathering and processing systems 
our ability to maintain existing supplies of natural gas and obtain new supplies is impacted by the level of workovers or recompletions of existing connected wells and successful drilling activity in areas currently dedicated to our pipelines  our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in other areas and our ability to obtain natural gas that has been released from other commitments 
we routinely monitor producer activity in the areas served by our gathering and processing systems to pursue new supply opportunities 
upstream volumes 
in the upstream segment  we continually monitor the production rates of the wells we operate 
this information is a critical indicator of the performance of our wells  and we evaluate and respond to any significant adverse changes 
we employ an experienced team of engineering and operations professionals to monitor these rates on a well by well basis and to design and implement remediation activities when necessary 
we also design and implement workover and drilling operations to increase production in order to offset the natural decline of our currently producing wells 
minerals volumes 
our minerals segment assets are comprised of royalty  overriding royalty  non producing mineral  and a couple of legacy non operating working interests  and therefore  we do not operate any of these properties 
in order to maintain or increase our cash flows from our minerals segment  we are reliant upon the efforts of the operators of our interests 
we do not control whether or when additional drilling or recompletion activity will be conducted on the properties in which we have an interest  however  when these activities do occur  we do not bear any of their costs with the exception of the two wells in which we own legacy working interests 
the level of drilling and recompletion activity conducted by the operators of our mineral interests is a function of many factors beyond our control  such as commodity prices  availability of oilfield goods and services  and the requirements and limitations placed by various legislative and regulatory entities 
nevertheless  at any time  there is often a significant amount of drilling and recompletion activity occurring on the properties in which we own an interest yielding us a cost free regeneration effect on mineral and royalty interests 
we monitor the additional production volumes that we realize from regeneration  and we use this information to make adjustments to our reserves estimates on a regular basis 
these adjustments to our reserves as a result of the regeneration effect are important measures of the performance of our minerals segment 
commodity pricing our margins in our midstream segment may be positively impacted to the extent the price of ngls increase in relation to the price of natural gas and may be adversely impacted to the extent the price of ngls decline in relation to the price of natural gas 
we refer to the price of ngls in relation to the price of natural gas as the fractionation spread 
both in our upstream and minerals segments  increases in crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices will generally favorably impact our revenues 
risk management we conduct risk management activities to mitigate the effect of commodity price and interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows 
our primary method of risk management in this respect is entering into derivative contracts 
to execute and evaluate the performance of these activities  we have formed a risk management committee which is comprised of several members of our senior management team and other key employees 
in addition to establishing the procedures and controls associated with risk management activities  this committee 
table of contents 
index to financial statements meets regularly to review the hedge portfolio and make recommendations for additional hedges 
they routinely estimate the potential effect of price and interest rate fluctuations on the expected future cash flows associated with our existing operations  and they evaluate whether the hedges sufficiently mitigate the effect of these fluctuations 
our risk management activities are captured in our corporate segment 
operating expenses midstream operating expenses 
operating expenses are a separate measure we use to evaluate operating performance of field operations 
direct labor  insurance  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses are largely independent of the volumes through our systems  but fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
upstream operating expenses 
we monitor and evaluate our upstream segment operating costs routinely  both on a total cost and unit cost basis 
many of the operating costs we incur are not directly related to the quantity of hydrocarbons that we produce  so we strive to maximize our production rates in order to improve our unit operating costs 
the most significant portion of our upstream operating costs is associated with the operation of the big escambia treating and processing facilities 
these facilities are overseen by members of our midstream engineering and operations staffs 
the majority of the cost of operating these facilities is independent of their throughput 
this includes items such as labor  chemicals  materials  and insurance 
minerals operating expenses 
we do not incur any operating costs associated with our minerals segment due to the non cost bearing nature of the mineral and royalty assets 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus income tax provision  interest net including both realized and unrealized interest rates risk management activities  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  other operating expense  other non cash operating and general and administrative expenses including non cash compensation related to our equity based compensation program less non realized revenues risk management instrument gain loss activities and other income expense 
adjusted ebitda is useful in determining our ability to sustain or increase distributions 
by excluding unrealized derivative gains losses  a non cash charge which represents the change in fair market value of our executed derivative instruments and is independent of our assets performance or cash flow generating ability  we believe adjusted ebitda reflects more accurately our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our level of indebtedness  make cash distributions to our unitholders and general partner and finance our maintenance capital expenditures

index to financial statements natural gas supply and demand natural gas is a significant source of energy and raw materials in the united states 
the graph depicts the annual domestic natural gas consumption from to  both in total and by the consuming sector of the economy 
the data exclude consumption that occurs in delivering the natural gas to the consumer lease  plant and pipeline uses  as well as the relatively insignificant amount consumed as vehicle fuel 
together  these activities consume approximately tcf per year 
logo during this period  domestic natural gas consumption by end users declined very slightly to its current level of approximately tcf per year 
notable shifts have occurred in this period  however  between the categories of consumption 
most significant are the decline in consumption in the industrial category cagr and the rise in consumption in power generation cagr 
residential and commercial consumption have both declined slightly and cagr  respectively 
we believe these changes in consumption patterns reflect a number of economic and social factors in the united states including the movement of manufacturing operations to other countries  relatively low population growth  increased productivity and fuel efficiency  the relocation of large numbers of people from northern to southern latitudes  and the attractiveness of natural gas as a fuel for electricity generation 
it is important to note that demand within certain categories of consumption as well as total consumption have been relatively inelastic with respect to the price of natural gas 
according to the eia  natural gas wellhead prices averaged mcf for  by  this had risen to mcf 
prices paid by the various consuming sectors reflect similar significant increases 
as expected  natural gas supply exhibits similar behavior as natural gas consumption 
the chart below shows natural gas supplied to the united states in total and from three sources domestic production  net pipeline imports  and net lng imports 
the total supply is slightly higher than that shown on the consumption graph 
table of contents 
index to financial statements because the data in the consumption graph excluded the various lease  plant and pipeline uses that occur prior to delivering the natural gas to consumers 
logo domestic production declined slightly in this period  while net pipeline imports increased initially primarily from canada but have recently declined 
these declines have been partially offset by increases in net lng imports 
in the future  there are a number of factors that could increase domestic supply  and potentially put downward pressure on natural gas prices 
these include increased natural gas production from the rockies after completion of the rockies express pipeline  and increases in lng imports 
nevertheless  these increases in supply may not be sufficient to offset the natural decline of existing domestic wells and continued declines in natural gas imported via pipeline 
since  the number of domestic producing natural gas wells which account for approximately of domestic natural gas production increased by  while the total domestic production declined slightly 
the average natural gas well produced mcf d in  by  this value was mcf d 
while an economic recession in the united states could reduce demand  we also believe that lower natural gas prices  combined with a weak dollar  would result in diversion of lng cargoes to more lucrative markets  effectively reducing supply and providing support for prices 
consequently  our outlook for natural gas prices is for them to remain near their current levels  except for short term price fluctuations related to seasonal demand and natural gas storage factors 
nevertheless  we recognize that declining natural gas prices could jeopardize our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders  so we utilize derivative instruments to reduce the volatility in the prices we receive for the natural gas we produce see risk management activities 
consistent with our expectation for strong natural gas prices is our belief that natural gas well drilling activity will continue to remain robust

index to financial statements petroleum supply  demand and outlook petroleum  primarily in the form of crude oil  condensate  and ngls  plays a critical role in the united states and world economies 
it is a primary source of energy  especially for transportation  and its components are used in an extensive number of manufacturing processes 
it is plainly evident that many of the characteristics of modern civilization  particularly in the industrialized countries  are a result of the abundance  utility  and relatively low cost of petroleum 
the supply and demand of petroleum is a very complex matter  however we have made the following observations about current trends 
currently  worldwide demand for petroleum has never been higher  and as of the spring of  real prices for crude oil were at historical highs 
during the period from to the latest for which final  complete year figures are available from the energy information agency  worldwide demand for petroleum including condensate and ngl s increased at a cagr 
this increase in demand was due in large part to the demand increase in china cagr  russia cagr and india cagr 
in  these countries were the second  fourth  and sixth largest consuming countries of petroleum 
from to  petroleum consumption growth for the rest of the world was only cagr  indicating that a large portion of worldwide growth was attributable to these populous countries 
we expect the underlying economic factors that have contributed to the rapid increases in petroleum consumption in countries like china and india  such as globalization and market liberalization  will continue  and that demand for petroleum will remain high and increasing 
we also expect to see significant rates of consumption growth in economies that are predominantly petroleum based such as the middle eastern countries and russia  at least so long as oil prices remain high 
the united states is the world s largest consumer of petroleum in  and its consumption has increased cagr during this period  which is approximately equal to its estimated population growth rate of united states census bureau 
we expect this rate of consumption growth to decline slightly over the near term due to the potential economic recession  the increasing dollar cost of petroleum  and the desire of many american s to reduce petroleum consumption due to environmental concerns 
with respect to petroleum supply  we believe that the most significant issue affecting supply  other than higher prices  has been the continued concentration of a very high percentage of the world s petroleum reserves in the hands of national oil companies 
according to a report prepared in for the united states congress by the congressional research service  all of the world s top ten reserve holders except lukoil was a state owned oil company 
these companies controlled an estimated of the world s reserves  and had an average reserve life index of in contrast  the world s five largest international oil companies had reserves with a reserve life index of national oil companies are subject to a variety of forces beyond market forces  and they do not always act in ways that maximize value  production or ultimate recovery 
many national oil companies are in countries in which petroleum production is the primary  sometimes only  source of exports  and the revenues are used for a variety of social purposes 
investment in new wells  and the use of proper reservoir management techniques is often secondary to the immediate needs of these social obligations 
as a result  the national oil companies of some of these countries  notably mexico and venezuela  have recently experienced stagnant or declining production rates 
in addition to these issues  petroleum production in other large  mature producing regions the united states  norway  and the united kingdom continues to decline  and political unrest and terrorism have had an adverse affect on production in other countries  such as iraq and nigeria 
we also note that this current period of high prices has not been caused by the overt restriction of petroleum production by opec or other significant producers 
we believe that producing countries are working very hard to meet demand  and that further significant increases in demand may require higher prices to justify additional production 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that the balance of supply and demand forces will result in continued high oil prices  barring a significant worldwide recession 
as is the case with natural gas  we recognize that declining natural gas prices could jeopardize our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders  so we utilize derivative instruments to reduce the volatility in the prices we receive for the crude  condensate  and natural gas liquids we produce see risk management activities 
impact of interest rates and inflation worldwide credit markets are experiencing a high level of turmoil and uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the impact of the united states subprime mortgage crisis 
we believe that these effects will persist through and possibly beyond  and are likely to place the united states economy into a recession 
we expect the united states federal open market committee to respond to these economic circumstances by continuing to reduce interest rates 
this should reduce the interest expense associated with our current debt exposure  but will not necessarily increase the amount of credit available to us on attractive terms 
there are currently a number of economic factors that could increase inflation in these include the previously mentioned  anticipated reduction in interest rates  but also include the record high prices that are being observed for certain commodities  such as energy and agricultural products  and the dramatic decline in the value of the us dollar 
we do not expect this type of inflationary pressure to have a material adverse impact on our business  however

this is primarily due to a continued decline in volumes in our west panhandle system and partially due to the colder than normal weather in that area during the first quarter 
the drilling activity in the west panhandle system is not sufficient to offset the natural declines experienced on the system 
while our contract mix in the west panhandle system provides us with a higher equity share of the production  the overall decline will continue and we expect to recover smaller equity production in the future on the west panhandle system 
the east panhandle system continues to experience strong growth in volumes and equity production due to the active granite wash drilling play located in roberts and hemphill counties  texas 
the liquids content of the natural gas is lower in the east texas panhandle system and our contract mix provides us with a smaller share of equity production as compared to the west panhandle system 
due to this difference in contract mix and liquid content between our west and east panhandle systems  while we have grown aggregate volumes during as compared to  our equity share of liquids production has been reduced 
our current goal is to grow volumes aggressively in the east panhandle system to offset the decline in volumes and our share of equity production in the west panhandle system

eac assets 
substantially all of the assets acquired in this transaction are located in or near escambia county  alabama 
we own and operate producing wells in three primary fields big escambia creek  flomaton and fanny church in the smackover and norphlett formations 
during the upstream covered period  these wells averaged approximately mmcfe d of production  net to our interest after deducting royalties 
production from these formations contains significant percentages of hydrogen sulfide hs and carbon dioxide co and must be extracted prior to sales 
in addition to the wells  the eac assets included two treating plants mmcf d capacity  to facilitate the extraction of these contaminants  and one processing plant mmcf d capacity to process and sell natural gas liquids 
these facilities are included within our upstream segment predominately because these facilities exist to service the equity owners in the wells in the field and not to service third party gas 
the field assets also include gathering pipelines  saltwater disposal wells and other equipment to conduct efficient operations 
the partnership owns an interest in the jay field plant that processes natural gas liquids from the flomaton and fanny church field 
redman assets 
the east texas assets acquired in this transaction are located in the smackover trend extending from rains county to henderson county  texas 
on account of the redman acquisition  we own and operate producing wells in nine fields which averaged approximately mmcfe d of production  net to our interest after deducting royalties  from the smackover formation during the upstream covered period 
production from these wells is mostly gathered and compressed by regency field services and transported to regency s eustace plant for separation  hs treating and ngl processing 
production from the smackover contains significant percentages of hydrogen sulfide requiring treating at the wellhead and extraction prior to sales 
the redman transaction also included the acquisition of operated assets in south texas and mississippi as well certain non operated wells in texas and louisiana 
the south texas assets include producing wells in jourdanton field in atascosa county which averaged approximately mmcfe d of production  net to our interest after deducting royalties  from the edwards formation during the upstream covered period 
these wells are gathered and compressed by eagle rock operating co  llc and are transported to the regency field services tilden plant for treating prior to sales 
in mississippi  the partnership operates producing wells which averaged approximately mcf d of production  net to our interest after deducting royalties  from the smackover formation during the upstream covered period 
the production is treated for hs and processed by enbridge 
in addition to the operated assets  the partnership acquired minor non operated working interests in producing wells  as well as producing wells with small overriding royalty interests 
the primary operator of the partnership s non operated interests is stroud petroleum inc stroud operates of these non operated properties 
revenues 
during the upstream covered period  the upstream segment contributed million of revenues 
production rates during the period were essentially flat to slightly increasing 
exiting  the average december production rate of mmcfe d was slightly above the august average production rate of mmcfe d due to the completion of two wells ie  the huddleston  associated with redman assets  and the manning  in big escambia creek field  certain wellbore cleanouts  and flush production following the unscheduled shutdown of the big escambia creek plant s sulfur treating facility in november  revenues during the upstream covered period were negatively impacted by approximately million  according to management s estimate  from the production downtime at big escambia creek field required for maintenance and repair of the plant s sulfur treating facilities 
following the big escambia creek downtime  production rates were restored to levels equivalent to those at the beginning of the fourth quarter of prices received for all products improved through the upstream covered period and contributed significantly to revenues 
in particular  oil and sulfur prices improved and  respectively  comparing august to december 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operating expenses 
operating expenses during the period  including severance and advalorem taxes  totaled million for the upstream assets 
excluding the severance and ad valorem taxes  the most significant portion of the operating expenses were associated with operating the big escambia creek and flomaton treating and processing facilities 
the incremental net operating expense associated with the unscheduled big escambia creek shutdown was offset by the reduction in severance taxes due to the reduced volume 
these facilities are required to extract the hs and co to achieve pipeline sales quality specifications  as well as beneficially extracting natural gas liquids and sulfur for sale 
the remaining operating expenses are attributed to base lease operating expenses and well workovers 
the most significant workovers were conducted on three wells with coiled tubing units to cleanout scale plugging the production tubulars 
all three wells were returned to normal producing rates following the cleanouts 
the remaining workover expenses were associated with wireline operations to remove scale from wells or improve natural gas flow 
depletion  depreciation and amortization 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense for was million for the five months in that we have owned the upstream assets acquired from eac and redman 
capital expenditures 
all upstream segment capital expenditures during the period  totaling million  were categorized as maintenance capital 
the majority of the capital approximately was associated with completing three wells drilled by eac and redman prior to the transaction close date 
in addition to the operated completions  an unsuccessful recompletion in jourdanton field was conducted  as well as various facility upgrades in each of the newly acquired asset areas 
the partnership participated in small non operated working interest projects consisting of ten drilling wells and two recompletions 
minerals segment twelve months ending december revenues oil and condensate natural gas ngls lease bonus  rentals and other total revenues operating costs and expenses operations and maintenance taxes other than income depreciation  depletion and impairment total operating costs and expenses operating income revenues 
our minerals segment consists of properties we acquired in the montierra acquisition on april  and in the maclondon acquisition on june  the figures and events discussed below relate only to the period after our acquisition of the properties the minerals covered period 
during the minerals covered period  we produced an average of approximately barrels of oil  mmcf of natural gas  and bbls of natural gas liquids per day 
the production rate during the period remained essentially flat due to drilling  recompletion and workover operations conducted by the various operators of the properties 
we did not incur any expense for these activities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a mineral owner typically experiences a delay of two to six months between the time a new well is completed and receipt of the initial royalty payment 
because of these delays we are generally not aware of new sources of production until many months after the drilling has occurred 
for this reason  we did not include any extensions and discoveries in our minerals segment and cannot quantify the level of drilling activity that occurred on the interests since we purchased them 
however  we are confident that we will receive revenues in for new wells that were drilled in after we have sufficient production history  we will account for these as extensions and discoveries in our proved reserves report 
our realized average prices during the minerals covered period in the minerals segment excluding the effect of hedging were bbl of oil  mcf of natural gas  and bbl of natural gas liquids 
prices for these commodities rose during the period 
the prices we receive for our production are influenced by a number of factors including their location  quality  and external market forces 
at our largest oil producing field  brea olinda the crude oil production is sold under a long term contract that is tied to nymex wti 
under the terms of the contract we receive approximately of the nymex wti price 
revenues from the sale of production were approximately million during the minerals covered period 
this represents approximately of our minerals segment revenues 
we received approximately million in bonus and delay rental payments in substantially all of this was derived from our ownership in the pure minerals 
the amount of revenue we receive from bonus and rental payments varies significantly from month to month 
therefore  we do not believe a meaningful set of conclusions can be drawn by observing changes in leasing activity over small time periods 
nevertheless  due to high commodity prices  we expect leasing activity to remain robust and expect to see similar levels of bonus income in future periods 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the minerals segment are predominately production expenses 
we paid approximately million in production expenses  which was substantially all production and ad valorem taxes 
these taxes are levied by various state and local taxing entities  and were approximately of our production revenue 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and impairment 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  we calculate depletion  depreciation and amortization using the units of production method 
in the case of our minerals segment  we only claim proved  producing reserves because  as a mineral interest owner  we lack sufficient engineering and geological data to estimate the proved undeveloped and non producing reserve quantities  and because we cannot control the occurrence or the timing of the activities that would cause such reserves to become productive 
since our units of production depletion and amortization rate is a function of our proved reserves  we experience a higher depletion and amortization rate than we would if we claimed undeveloped or non producing reserves 
our depletion  depreciation and amortization rate during was mcfe  and our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately million 
in addition  we recorded an impairment change of million as result of steeper decline rates in certain fields 
one of the distinctive characteristics of our large  diversified mineral position is that operators are continually conducting exploration and development drilling  recompletion  and workover operations on our interests 
we do not pay for these operations  but we do receive a share of the production they generate 
this mode of operation has resulted in relatively constant production rates from our mineral interests in the last several years  and we expect that this will continue 
we refer to this phenomenon as regeneration 
the new sources of production that we expect to to materialize due to regeneration will also be the source of future extensions and discoveries  and positive revisions to our reserve estimates  which may effect out future depletion and amortization rates

given the uncertainty surrounding future commodity prices  and the general inability to predict these as they relate to the caps  floors  swaps and strike prices at which we have hedged our exposure  it is difficult to predict the magnitude and impact that marking our hedges to market will have on our income from operations in future periods 
conversely  negative commodity price movements affecting our revenues and costs are expected to be partially offset by our executed derivative instruments 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this growth in general and administrative expenses was mostly driven by increased head count in our corporate office as a result of our acquisitions  our expansion into the minerals and upstream businesses related to the montierra  redman and eac acquisitions  and to recruiting efforts in accounting  back office  engineering  land and operations related corporate personnel associated with being a public partnership 
corporate office payroll expenses increased by million as a result 
also as a result of being a public partnership  our public partnership expenses related to audit  tax  sarbanes oxley compliance and others increased by million 
also  expenses related to outside professional services  including those related to the registration of common units related to our private placements of equity and funding of acquisitions with our common units  impacted our general and administrative expenses expense by million 
insurance costs increased by million as we insured our acquired assets 
in addition  contract labor on an interim basis as we integrated acquisitions contributed to this increase in our general and administrative expenses by million  while it infrastructure increased by million and we recorded other miscellaneous expense of million 
at the present time  we do not allocate our general and administrative expenses cost to our operational segments 
the corporate segment bears the entire amount 
total other income expense 
which includes both realized and unrealized gains losses from our interest rate swaps  increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of an increase in our debt outstanding from million at the end of  to million at the end of this increase in funded debt results from our debt financing of several organic projects and acquisitions during the year  including the tyler county pipeline expansion  red deer processing plant project and the acquisitions of redman and eac  partially financed by a million draw from our credit facility 
in addition  increased base interest rate and a higher interest rate margin also increased our interest expense 
we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility on december  as discussed in greater detail in item liquidity and capital resources below and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  which carries a lower interest rate margin than our previous credit facility 
however  this only impacted our interest expense for a two week period 
total other income expense  includes interest rate swap realized gain of million 
we also recorded an unrealized mark to market loss of million related to our interest rate risk management position reflected in interest expense net 
the unrealized loss relates to our future periods interest swaps and from changes during the year in the underlying interest rate associated with the derivatives 
the unrealized mark to market loss did not have any impact on cash activities for the period and period  as applicable  and is excluded by definition from our calculation of adjusted ebitda

adjusted ebitda as defined  increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the components of adjusted ebitda are revenues minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids  offset by operating expenses  taxes other than income and general and administrative expenses 
as described above  revenues minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids for the midstream segment including the texas panhandle  east texas louisiana including the acquired laser assets  and the newly created south texas segment grew by million as compared to the year ended december  the acquisitions leading to our entry into our upstream and mineral segments contributed million and million  respectively  to revenues while our corporate segment s realized commodity derivatives loss increased by million as compared to the year ended december  this resulted in million of total incremental revenues minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids  adjusted to exclude the impact of un realized commodity derivatives not included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda  with respect to operating expenses including taxes other than income  increased by million for our midstream segment with respect to  while the acquisitions which created the upstream and minerals segments contributed incremental operating expenses including taxes other than income of million and million  respectively 
this resulted in total incremental operating expenses of million  as compared to general and administrative expense  captured in the corporate segment  increased by million adjusted to exclude non cash compensation charges related to our ltip program  while other expense decreased by million  with respect to as a result  revenues excluding the impact of unrealized commodity derivative activity minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids increased by million  operating expenses increased by million and general and administrative expenses increased by million  resulting in an increase to adjusted ebitda of million from to other expense

financial results for the year ended december   include activities of the oneok texas field services assets acquired in december  brookeland assets acquired in march and april and acquisition of mgs acquired in june 
operating revenues for sales of natural gas  ngls and condensate increased by million  primarily from the panhandle assets twelve months of contribution in versus one month in  brookeland assets and mgs acquisitions and the contribution from the constructed tyler county pipeline during the latter part of the increase of million in revenues for compression  gathering and processing services was also favorably impacted by the increased activities from the acquired assets 
as a result of our commodity hedging activities  total revenues include a realized gain of million on risk management investments that were settled for the twelve month period and an unrealized mark to market net loss of million which includes the fair value change of the option premiums associated with the panhandle assets 
as the forward price curves for our hedged commodities shift in relation to the caps  floors  swap and strike prices at which we have executed our derivative instruments  the fair market value of such instruments changes through time 
the mark to market net unrealized loss reflects overall favorable forward curve price movements during the twelve month period for the underlying commodities for the derivative instruments 
the net unrealized loss is comprised of million gain related to our ngl position and crude oil as the forward curve prices in these commodities decreased during the quarter 
partially offsetting the unrealized gain  we recorded an unrealized net loss of million related to natural gas forward curve price movements during the year 
the million remaining difference refers to the amortization of the put premiums as the underlying

the unrealized net loss of million did not have any impact on cash activities for the period as applicable  and as such is excluded from our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
purchase of natural gas and ngls increased by million reflecting the cost of goods expense for the increased sales of natural gas  ngls and condensate revenue as discussed above 
revenues minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids increased by million reflecting the increased business activity in revenues and purchases  as discussed above 
reducing revenues minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids for the period is the unrealized mark to market loss related to our risk management activities as described above 
excluding this amount  revenues minus cost of natural gas and natural gas liquids would have been million as compared to million for the period 
operations and maintenance expense increased by million for the year ended compared to  due to the increased operations from the acquired assets as well as from the first phase of the tyler county pipeline project completed earlier in general and administrative expense also increased by million  as the partnership built up its corporate infrastructure and personnel to manage the acquired assets and public partnership expenses 
included in general and administrative expense is property tax  employee benefit programs and the partnership s property and liability insurance programs 
adjusted ebitda for the year was million as compared to million for the increase is primarily from the contribution of the acquired assets during the year  as well as the contribution from the tyler county pipeline project 
during the fourth quarter of  holdings paid million at the time of the initial public offering to terminate the advisory services agreement with natural gas partners 
the transaction was recorded as an expense on the partnership s income with the offset to members equity 
as the purchase price of the acquired assets was allocated and pushed down to the operating entities balance sheets  depreciation and amortization expense also increased by million from the associated higher fixed assets and intangible assets of the acquired assets  as well as additions during the year 
as the panhandle acquisition was substantially financed with a credit loan facility  interest expense  net increased by million  including interest swap realized gain of million 
we did not have outstanding debt prior to the panhandle assets acquisition in included in interest expense for is approximately million of direct cost expensed related to the amended and restated credit agreement which became effective on august   as well as higher debt issuance cost amortization during we recorded an unrealized mark to market gain of million related to our interest rate risk management position 
the unrealized gain relates to our future periods interest swaps and from changes during the quarter in the underlying interest rate associated with the derivatives 
the unrealized mark to market gain did not have a significant impact on cash activities during the period 
we recorded million of income taxes related to temporary differences caused by the texas entity level tax to become effective in other matters hurricanes katrina and rita 
hurricanes katrina and rita struck the gulf coast region of the united states on august  and september   respectively  causing widespread damage to the energy infrastructure in the region 
the storms did not cause material direct damage to any of our assets in the region 
while neither hurricane katrina nor hurricane rita caused material direct damage to our facilities  hurricane rita did disrupt the operations of ngl pipelines and fractionators in the houston  texas area and caused power

index to financial statements outages to some of our producers in the southeast texas area 
as a result of these disruptions  in we were forced to temporarily curtail certain of our producers in the region for approximately four days and to operate our indian springs facility in a reduced recovery mode for approximately six days 
wild fires in texas panhandle 
wild fires in the texas panhandle during the week of march   temporarily affected our operations in the region 
while the fires did not cause material direct damage to our facilities  some experienced down time was caused by power outages at the local electric co ops 
our lefors and cargray plants came back up with reduced flow rates as producers had shut in their production during the fires 
there was minimal and temporary damage sustained in the field to a very small number of metering facilities and one flow line 
less than million was spent on repairs caused by the fires 
the overall economic impact has been estimated to be between million and million during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources historically  our sources of liquidity have included cash generated from operations  equity investments by our owners and borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
more recently  we have successfully raised significant resources through the private placement of our common units among institutional investors 
we believe that the cash generated from these sources will continue to be sufficient to meet our minimum quarterly cash distributions and our requirements for short term working capital and long term capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we acquire additional midstream assets or natural gas or oil properties that exceed our existing capital resources  we expect that we will finance those acquisitions with a combination of expanded or new debt facilities and  if necessary  new equity issuances 
the ratio of debt and equity issued will be determined by our management and our board of directors as deemed appropriate 
cash flows from january  through december   there have been several key events that have had major impacts on our cash flows

as an operator of upstream assets and as a working interest owner  our capital requirements have increased to maintain those properties and to replace depleting resources 
we anticipate that we will meet these requirements through cash generated from operations  equity issuances  or debt incurrence  however  we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to obtain the necessary capital under terms acceptable to us

the energy business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment for the acquisition or development of new facilities 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either growth capital expenditures  which are made to acquire additional assets to increase our business  to expand and upgrade existing systems and facilities or to construct or acquire similar systems or facilities  or grow our production in our upstream business  or maintenance capital expenditures  which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets  to meet regulatory requirements  to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and extend their useful lives  or to connect wells to maintain existing system volumes and related cash flows  in our upstream business  maintenance capital is defined as capital which is expended to maintain our production and cash flow levels in the near future

we may use financial instruments such as puts  calls  swaps and other derivatives to mitigate the effects of the identified risks 
adverse effects on our cash flow from changes in crude oil  natural gas  ngl product prices or interest rates could adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  meet debt service obligations  fund required capital expenditures and other similar requirements

see critical accounting policies and estimates risk management activities for further discussion of the accounting for derivative contracts 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  ngls and other commodities as a result of our gathering  processing  producing and marketing activities  which produce a naturally long position in crude oil  ngls and natural gas 
both our profitability and our cash flow are affected by volatility in prevailing prices for these commodities 
these prices are impacted by changes in the supply and demand for these commodities  as well as market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control 
historically  changes in the prices of ngls  such as natural gasoline  have generally correlated with changes in the price of crude oil 
for a discussion of the volatility of crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices  please read risk factors 
we manage this commodity price exposure through an integrated strategy that includes management of our contract portfolio  matching sales prices of commodities with purchases  optimization of our portfolio by monitoring basis and other price differentials in our areas of operations  and the use of derivative contracts 
crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices can also indirectly affect our profitability by influencing the level of drilling activity and related opportunities for our service 
to the extent that we market commodities in which pricing terms cannot be matched and there is a substantial risk of price exposure  we attempt to use financial derivative instruments hedges to mitigate the risk 
we have implemented a risk management policy which allows management to execute crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas hedging instruments  which may include swaps  collars  options and other derivatives  in order to reduce exposure to substantial adverse changes in the prices of these commodities 
these hedges are only intended to mitigate the risk associated with our natural physical position 
we monitor and ensure compliance with this risk management policy through senior level executives in our operations  finance and legal departments 
our risk management policy includes the following provisions anti speculation speculative buying and selling of commodity or interest rate products is prohibited 
speculation includes  but is not limited to  buying or selling commodity or financial instruments that are not necessary for meeting

payment obligations in connection with our hedging transactions are secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing our senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of our senior secured lenders 
as long as this first priority lien is in effect  we will have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit  or other additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time even if our counterparty s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in our creditworthiness

in evaluating credit risk exposure we analyze the financial condition of each counterparty before entering into an agreement 
our corporate credit policy lists the resource materials and information required to assess the financial condition of each prospective customer 
the credit threshold for each customer is also based upon a time horizon for exposure  which is typically days or less 
we establish these credit limits and monitor and adjust them on an ongoing basis 
we also require counterparties to provide letters of credit or other collateral financial agreements for exposure in excess of the established threshold 
all of our sales agreements contain adequate assurance provisions to permit us to mitigate or eliminate future credit risk  at our sole discretion  by suspending deliveries until obligations and payments are satisfied or by canceling the agreement
