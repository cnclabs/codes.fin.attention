item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated executive overview we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states  canada and mexico 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because as a larger company we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over smaller competitors 
these advantages include greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment  and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 
we offer for rent over  classes of rental equipment  including construction equipment  industrial and heavy machinery  aerial work platforms  trench safety equipment and homeowner items 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of used rental equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
in  rental equipment revenues represented percent of our total revenues 
we expect this percentage to increase to approximately percent in as we reposition our contractor supplies business and sell less used equipment 
in the second half of  in response to internal analyses and a study we commissioned from a nationally recognized consulting firm  we began to implement a change in strategy aimed at growing our earnings at higher margins  while also continuing to generate significant cash flow 
the three key elements of this strategy are refocusing our employees and sales representatives on our core rental business  optimizing the management of our rental fleet  and reducing our operating costs 
we believe this strategy  coupled with our broad geographic footprint  extensive rental fleet  advanced information technology systems  disciplined purchasing power  industry experience and ability to deliver extraordinary customer service  will enable us to strengthen our leadership position in the equipment rental industry and improve our returns to shareholders 
in particular  we plan to achieve our objectives by optimizing our field operations 
we intend to continue the process of analyzing and optimizing our field operations in order to improve fleet allocation  service and delivery and sales management efforts 
we expect this process will create opportunities for rental location closures as fleet assets are moved from low return locations to high return locations  as well as additional cost saving opportunities from the consolidation of administrative and back office functions 
we believe optimizing our field operations will increase equipment utilization and reduce operating costs 
reducing operating costs 
in an effort to bring our cost structure in line with those of other leading equipment rental companies  in the spring of we undertook a thorough review of our back office functions related to the general and administrative aspects of our business in order to identify opportunities for increased efficiencies 
as a result of this process  we identified a number of opportunities to consolidate duplicative functions  outsource certain back office operations and automate processes 
as a result  we have implemented a headcount reduction program that  as of december   had achieved a percent workforce reduction as compared to december   and undertaken specific initiatives to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold 
accelerating sourcing initiatives 
our rental equipment purchases have been centralized for many years which we believe has enabled us to negotiate more favorable pricing and other terms from our equipment providers 
we launched a strategic sourcing initiative in that was designed to centralize our non equipment purchases 
we believe that centralizing the procurement of these items will allow us to leverage our significant purchasing power to obtain better pricing and or terms from our suppliers 
to date  we have realized approximately in cumulative savings across a wide range of products  and we expect additional savings associated with this initiative in optimizing time utilization 
we continue to reassess existing fleet investments and have recently realigned certain of our incentive programs to reward equipment sharing across districts and increase the time utilization of our fleet assets 
additionally  we intend to better allocate resources  including limited growth capital  to where there is strong customer demand  resulting in fleet rationalization opportunities 
by coupling such initiatives with an increased focus on preventative maintenance and improved turn around time for returned equipment  we believe we can further increase the time utilization of our fleet  which was up percentage points year over year in refocusing contractor supplies business 
we sell a variety of contractor supplies  such as construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies  through several channels  including our sales representatives  rental branches and us and canadian product catalogues 
although revenues from the contractor supplies business grew from in to in  this business has required us to maintain significant volumes of inventory in order to meet customer demand and carries a higher cost structure relative to our core equipment rental business 
in  the gross margin for our contractor supplies business was percent as compared to percent for equipment rentals 
we have refocused our contractor supplies business and positioned it more clearly as a complementary offering to our equipment rental business 
we expect this to result in productivity improvements within our sales force  thus helping to improve equipment utilization 
as part of this initiative  we are reducing the number of stock keeping units associated with these operations  especially in lower margin commodity categories 
additionally  we have recently closed three of our nine distribution centers and we intend to close an additional two distribution centers in the first half of we expect these changes will reduce our revenues associated with contractor supplies  but improve our margins 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report  the company is subject to certain ongoing class action and derivative suits  as well as the subject of an sec inquiry 
the us attorney s office has also requested information from the company about matters related to the sec inquiry 
although we have not accrued any amounts related to the ultimate disposition of these matters to date  any liabilities resulting from an adverse judgment or settlement of these matters may be material to our results of operations and cash flows during the period incurred 
other costs associated with the sec inquiry  the us attorney s office inquiry and the class action and derivative suits  including reimbursement of attorneys fees incurred by indemnified officers and directors  are expensed as incurred 
financial overview income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  income from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  was a record for the company and included an after tax gain of  or per diluted share  related to the recent termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus see other income below 
excluding the merger termination benefit  our income from continuing operations of  which was also a record for the company  increased percent from for income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share  increased percent from for for  we are forecasting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 
free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements free cash flow as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment fas r on january  fas r requires that excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows prospectively from january  prior to the adoption of fas r  such excess tax benefits were presented as operating cash flows 
there were no excess tax benefits for and as we were in a net operating loss position for federal income tax purposes 
in  we reported revenues and free cash flow of billion and  respectively 
our equipment rental revenue growth of percent trailed our primary end market  private non residential construction  which grew percent in according to department of commerce data which has not been adjusted for inflation 
the lag in growth rate between our equipment rental revenue and our primary end market primarily reflects a more targeted allocation of our growth capital  which we deliberately did not increase to a level that would have kept pace on a nation wide basis with industry demand 
our percent overall revenue growth  which includes rental revenue growth of percent  reflects a percentage point improvement in time utilization to percent  partially offset by a percent decline in rental rates 
free cash flow for includes of cash we received following the termination of our merger agreement with affiliates of cerberus capital management  lp cerberus  less transaction related costs of  see other income below 
in  we reported revenues and free cash flow of billion and  respectively 
our equipment rental revenue growth of percent trailed our primary end market  private non residential construction  which grew percent in according to department of commerce data 
our percent revenue growth  which includes equipment rental growth of percent  reflects increased rental rates of percent  partially offset by a percentage point decline in time utilization to percent 
in addition to generating significant revenue and free cash flow growth in  we reduced our total debt including our subordinated convertible debentures by revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenue total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects a percent increase in equipment rental revenue  partially offset by a percent decline in used equipment sales 
the increase in equipment rental revenue reflects a percentage point improvement in time utilization  partially offset by a percent decline in rental rates 
the decline in used equipment sales reflects volume declines and a shift in the mix of equipment sold 
the percent decline in contractor supplies sales is consistent with the strategic shift we began in the second half of to reposition our contractor supplies business 
looking forward  we expect contractor supplies and used equipment sales to decline by approximately percent and percent  respectively  in as compared to these anticipated reductions are consistent with our refocus on the core rental business as well as our efforts to improve time utilization 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects an percent increase in equipment rentals and a percent increase in contractor supplies sales 
the increase in equipment rentals reflects a percent increase in rental rates  partially offset by a percentage point decline in time utilization to percent 
the increase in contractor supplies sales reflects increased volume as we expanded our product offering 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u 
s gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by days  the monthly term 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to ten percent of cost 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues  and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and expect that we will continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions 
the long lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment  transportation equipment and real estate 
with limited exceptions  virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as to be used  rather than as to be sold 
equipment that we acquire and classify as to be used is recorded at fair value  as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment 
we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 
in addition to long lived fixed assets  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets 
however  when appropriate  we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence 
the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill  customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
customer relationships and non compete agreements are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we generally evaluate projected taxable income over an appropriate period for each jurisdiction to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and  in addition  examine the length of the carryforward to ensure the deferred tax assets are established at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided a partial valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset for state operating loss carryforward amounts 
this valuation allowance was required because it is more likely than not that some of the state carryforward amounts will expire unused 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety  pump and power 
the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial  industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico 
the trench safety  pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  pump and power segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 
these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates and allocates resources 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating results 
we completed acquisitions in each of   and which are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions  we believe that our results for these periods are not fully directly comparable  although there is no material impact from these acquisitions 
revenues by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows general rentals trench safety  pump and power total equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals

discontinued operation 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our traffic control business to hts acquisition  inc  an entity formed by affiliates of private equity investors wynnchurch capital partners and oak hill special opportunities fund lp in connection with this transaction  we recorded an after tax loss on sale in of the transaction closed in february and we received net proceeds of the loss on sale  as well as the results of operations of our traffic control business  have been reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of income 
fourth quarter items 
during the fourth quarter  we reduced our reserve for obsolescence and shrinkage by following our annual physical inventory inspections 
this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals  excluding depreciation 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a benefit of reflecting recent experience related to our estimated provision for self insurance reserves 
this benefit was recorded in cost of equipment rentals  excluding depreciation 
in addition to these matters  during the fourth quarter we recognized income of pre tax related to the termination of our merger agreement with cerberus as well as net foreign currency transaction gains of pre tax 
both of these matters are discussed further below  see other income 
fourth quarter items 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of reflecting recent loss experience related to our estimated provision for self insurance reserves 
of this amount  was recorded in cost of equipment rentals  excluding depreciation  and the balance was recorded in discontinued operations as it related to our traffic control business 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage by following our annual physical inventory inspections 
of this amount  was recorded in cost of contractor supplies sales and was recorded in cost of equipment rentals  excluding depreciation 
in addition to these matters  we recorded a charge of related to our estimated exposure for sales tax matters 
this amount has been reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
segment operating profit 
segment operating profit and operating margin for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows general rentals trench safety  pump and power total operating profit operating margin operating profit operating margin operating profit operating margin general rentals 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   general rentals accounted for percent of our total operating profit 
this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals revenue contribution over the same period 
general rentals operating margin in increased percentage points from  primarily resulting from the realization of the initial benefits of cost saving initiatives implemented in general rentals operating margin in increased percentage points from  as the benefits of higher rental rates were partially offset by increased costs for labor and benefits as well as reduced gross margins on contractor supplies 
trench safety  pump and power 
operating profit in declined  reflecting slight declines in gross profit on new equipment sales and contractor supplies  partially offset by an increase in gross profit on sales of rental equipment 
operating profit in increased  reflecting a increase in revenues principally related to acquisitions and cold starts 
gross margin 
we have historically realized higher gross margins on sales of rental equipment than on sales of new equipment 
this is consistent with the marketplace in general and not unique to united rentals 
gross margins by revenue classification were as follows year ended december  total gross margin equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues gross margin of percent declined percentage points from  reflecting a percentage point decline in gross margin on equipment rentals  a percentage point decline in gross margin on sales of rental equipment and a percentage point decline in gross margin on contractor supplies  partially offset by a percentage point improvement in gross margin on service and other revenues 
the decline in equipment rental gross margin reflects increased rental costs and a percent decline in rental rates  partially offset by a percentage point improvement in time utilization 
the decline in gross margins on sales of rental equipment and contractor supplies reflects pricing pressure as well as a shift in the mix of product sold 
the increase in margin on service and other revenues reflects increased revenue 
gross margin of percent increased percentage points from  reflecting a percentage point increase in equipment rentals gross margin and a percentage point increase in the sales of rental equipment gross margin  partially offset by a percentage point reduction in gross margin on contractor supplies 
the improved equipment rental margin reflected a percent increase in rental rates  partially offset by a percentage point decline in time utilization to percent 
the improved margin on sales of rental equipment reflects improved pricing and a shift in the mix of equipment sold 
the reduction in contractor supplies sales gross margin reflects increased costs related to our distribution centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expense information for each of the three years in the period ended december  was as follows year ended december  total sg a expenses sg a as a percentage of revenue sg a expense primarily includes sales force compensation  information technology costs  third party professional fees  advertising and marketing expenses  management salaries  bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead 
sg a expense of declined  or percent  as compared to and declined by percentage points as a percentage of revenue 
this decline reflects a reduction in professional fees related to regulatory matters  the initial benefits of our cost saving initiatives  reduced incentive compensation costs and a reduction in bad debt expense 
the benefit associated with these matters was partially offset by severance costs associated with headcount reductions completed in the second half of  the amendment of our former chairman s service agreement  charges associated with the accelerated vesting  upon his june  retirement  of a restricted stock award held by our former chief executive officer  as well as normal inflationary increases 
sg a expense of increased percent as compared to and was flat as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in actual sg a costs reflects normal inflationary increases  higher selling and insurance costs related to growth in the business and increased professional fees for business improvement initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by a year over year reduction of in the level of professional fees related to regulatory matters as well as reduced bad debt expense 
non rental depreciation and amortization for each of the three years in the period ended december  was as follows year ended december  non rental depreciation and amortization non rental depreciation and amortization includes i depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent such as computers and office equipment and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements as well as ii the amortization of other intangible assets 
our other intangible assets consist of non compete agreements as well as customer related intangible assets 
the increases in and relate to a higher basis of depreciable assets 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we determined that we had been depreciating certain vehicles on capital lease over a period which exceeded the related contractual lease terms 
as a result  our non rental depreciation and amortization expense for includes a charge of to correct depreciation expense recorded since the fourth quarter of interest expense  net for each of the three years in the period ended december  was as follows year ended december  interest expense  net interest expense  net for the year ended december  decreased or percent as compared to  reflecting lower average debt balances and the benefit we recognized related to the mark to market impact of certain interest rate swaps 
the decrease also reflects the absence of the charge we incurred in related to our term loan prepayment and the retirement of subordinated convertible debentures 
interest expense  net for the year ended december  increased  or percent  as compared to  reflecting the increase in interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt  partially offset by lower average debt balances 
the increase also reflects a net charge of that we recorded related to our term loan prepayment as well as the retirement of of subordinated convertible debentures 
the net charge of includes non cash write offs of associated with deferred financing costs  partially offset by a gain of recognized in conjunction with the termination of certain interest rate caps 
the term loan prepayment and retirement of subordinated convertible debentures are discussed further below  see liquidity and capital resources 
as of december  and  approximately and percent of our total debt was floating rate debt  respectively 
as discussed further below see liquidity and capital resources  in january  we terminated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion 
had these swaps been terminated as of december   approximately percent of our total debt would have been floating rate debt 
interest expense subordinated convertible debentures for each of the three years in the period ended december  was as follows year ended december  interest expense subordinated convertible debentures as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  the subordinated convertible debentures included in our consolidated balance sheets reflect the obligation to our subsidiary that has issued preferred securities 
this subsidiary is not consolidated in our financial statements because we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust 
as of december  and  the aggregate amount of subordinated convertible debentures outstanding was the decline in interest expense subordinated convertible debentures from to reflects the retirement of of these subordinated convertible debentures in the second half of other income 
in april  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the commencement of a process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value  including a possible sale of the company 
in july  we announced that we had signed a merger agreement to be acquired by cerberus 
in december  following the termination of that merger agreement  we received a break up fee of other income for includes the income associated with the receipt of the break up fee  net of related transaction costs of other income for also includes of net foreign currency transaction gains relating to intercompany transactions primarily between our canadian subsidiary  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar  and our u 
s subsidiaries  whose functional currency is the us dollar 
because these intercompany transactions do not hedge a foreign currency commitment and have been determined not to be of a long term investment nature  exchange rate movements between the canadian and us dollars are required to be included in income during the period in which exchange rates change 
prior to  we had been reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes on these intercompany transactions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  rather than including them in income 
our results for include the cumulative impact of correcting for this matter 
of the recognized in  relates to exchange rate movements and relates to prior periods 
this correction does not affect historical or future cash flows and its effect on our current and prior years net income  cash flows from operations  and stockholders equity is not material 
income taxes 
the following table summarizes our continuing operations provision for income taxes and the related effective tax rate for each respective period income from continuing operations provision for income taxes effective tax rate a detailed reconciliation of this effective tax rate to the us federal statutory income tax rate is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the differences between the effective tax rates of percent  percent  and percent and the us federal statutory income tax rate of percent for   and  respectively  relate primarily to state taxes and certain nondeductible charges and other items 
additionally  includes a benefit associated with the release of state tax valuation allowances  partially offset by certain non deductible compensation expense and prior year state tax matters 
our effective income tax rate will change based on discrete events such as audit settlements as well as other factors  including the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in those jurisdictions 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity 
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices  which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services  ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes  regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 
our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility 
as of december   we had i of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility portion of our senior secured credit facility  ii of borrowing capacity available under our accounts receivable securitization facility and iii cash and cash equivalents of cash equivalents at december  consist of high quality  low risk treasury securities and do not include any auction rate securities 
we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next twelve months 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our existing operations over the next twelve months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital  ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iii payments due under operating leases and iv debt service 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our equipment or real estate or through the use of additional operating leases 
additionally  if we were to pursue an acquisition  recapitalization or other strategy to enhance shareholder value  our existing levels of indebtedness may increase and  as a result  a greater portion of our cash may be required to service any such indebtedness 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of i interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and ii foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
interest rate risk 
during and earlier periods  we utilized interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion 
the effect of the swap agreements were  at december   to convert billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments 
the fixed rate notes being converted consisted of i of our percent notes through  ii of our percent notes through  and iii of our percent senior subordinated notes through as of december   after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements  we had an aggregate of billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
as of december   the debt that was subject to fluctuations in interest rates included of borrowings under our canadian revolving facility  billion in swaps and of term loans 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the revolving credit facility which represents the canadian rate  since the amount outstanding was canadian borrowings  ii percent for the debt subject to our swap agreements and iii percent for the term loan 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements  our annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility

the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars 
based upon the level of our canadian operations during relative to the company as a whole  a percent change in this exchange rate would not have a material impact on our earnings 
we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of december  we do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes
