non gaap financial information non gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation g  portions of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include a comparison of certain non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the presentation of non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company s management believes that the non gaap financial measures discussed below facilitate an understanding of our results of operations and provide a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods 
specifically  we are presenting operating expenses excluding litigation settlements in  non cash charge associated with the donation of shares of class a common stock to the mastercard foundation and litigation settlements in  and catch up adjustment relating to cash award executive incentive plans and litigation settlements in see operating expenses for a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding the special items above to the most directly comparable gaap measure 
similarly  we present the effective tax rate with and without the impact of the stock donation to the mastercard foundation the foundation for the year ended december  because the stock donation to the foundation is a non cash and non recurring item that was completed in conjunction with our change in governance and ownership structure implemented during the second quarter of we believe the effective tax rate without the impact of the stock donation to the foundation is more meaningful to investors in understanding our financial results  including comparability to the same periods in and finally  we are presenting in and gross assessments growth excluding a reclassification from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues and sepa pricing increases 
we believe the gross assessments growth rate excluding these items is representative of the core growth in these revenues 
overview we are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers credit  debit and related payment programs 
we manage a family of well known  widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard  mastercard electronic  maestro and cirrus  which we license to our customers 
as part of managing these brands  we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system 
cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers 
accordingly  we do not issue cards  extend credit to cardholders  determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers  or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

table of contents we recorded net income of billion  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  versus million  or per diluted share  in our liquidity and capital position remain strong  with billion in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities and billion in stockholders equity as of december  net revenue growth of in was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes 
the foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the brazilian real against the dollar accounted for of the growth while approximately of our net revenue growth was due to the impact of pricing adjustments

see other income expense 
regulatory actions  litigation  consolidation within the banking industry and the growing power of merchants may lead us to change our pricing arrangements  reducing our overall revenues and having an adverse impact on our business 
see item a risk factors of this report for these and other risks facing our business 
we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper based forms of payment  such as cash and checks  toward electronic forms of payment  such as cards  creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business 
our strategy is to continue our growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry such as premium affluent and contactless cards  commercial payments and debit  enhancing our merchant relationships  growing acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands 
we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world 
we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated  dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs  marketing  product development  technology  processing  consulting and information services 
by investing in strong customer relationships over the long term  we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time 
impact of foreign currency rates our operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
in most regions except europe  assessments are calculated based on local currency volume converted to us dollar volume using average exchange rates for the related assessment period 
in europe  the local currency volumes are converted to the euro 
as a result  assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar or euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period 
in and  gross dollar volume gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased and  respectively  exceeding local currency gdv growth of and  compared to the same periods in the prior year  indicating the weakening of the us dollar 
we are especially impacted by the movements of the euro and the brazilian real relative to the us dollar since the functional currency of mastercard europe  our principal european operating subsidiary  is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real 
the strengthening or devaluation of the 
table of contents us dollar against the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the us dollar 
the impact on operating results for each of the years stated is summarized as follows revenue growth attributable to translation of euro and real revenues to us dollars operating expense growth attributable to translation of euro and real expenses to us dollars revenues we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment related services operations fees and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments 
gdv includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage purchases  cash disbursements  balance transfers and convenience checks on mastercard branded cards 
our pricing for transactions and services is complex 
each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided 
we review our pricing and implement changes on an ongoing basis 
in addition  standard pricing varies by region and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 
our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 
we earned approximately  and of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately  and of our net revenues from net assessments in  and  respectively 
approximately of the shift to operation fees from assessments in was due to the restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in april operations fees are typically transaction based but may also be volume based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers 
mastercard s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders banks  acquirers the merchants banks  merchants and cardholders 
operations fees are charged to issuers  acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services  specific programs to promote mastercard branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses 
the significant components of operations fees are as follows authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholder s transaction 
we charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to or from the issuer or  in certain circumstances  such as when the issuer s systems are unavailable  for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer s instructions 
our rules  which vary across regions  establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 
these fees are primarily paid by issuers 
settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees 
first  we clear a transaction by transferring the financial transaction details among issuers  acquirers or their designated third party processors 
then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers 
we charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services 
these fees are primarily paid by issuers 
switch fees are charges for the use of the mastercard debit switch the mds  our debit processing system 
the mds transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks 
these fees are primarily paid by issuers 
currency conversion and cross border are volume based revenues 
cross border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different 
we have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than currencies through our global system  providing cardholders the ability to utilize  and merchants to accept  mastercard cards across multiple country 
table of contents borders 
we can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchant s local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer  who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholder s statement in their own home currency 
in april  we restructured our currency conversion by initiating a charge to our issuers and acquirers for all cross border transaction volumes regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale 
we also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for performing currency conversion 
acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of gdv and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale 
these fees are primarily us based 
warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants 
connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access  equipment  and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages 
consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors  our professional advisory services group 
we provide a wide range of consulting and research services associated with our customers payment activities and programs 
research includes revenues from subscription based services  access to research inquiry  and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group 
we do not anticipate consulting and research fees becoming a significant percentage of our business 
other operations fees represent various revenue streams  including cardholder services  a variety of account and transaction enhancement services  fees for us acquirers accepting transactions from cardholders with non us issuers  compliance and penalty fees  holograms and publications 
cardholder services are benefits provided with mastercard branded cards  such as insurance  telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines 
generally  we process the majority of mastercard branded domestic transactions in the united states  the united kingdom  canada  brazil and australia 
we process substantially all cross border transactions using mastercard  maestro and cirrus branded cards 
we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement  authorization and switch fees on cross border transactions and earn cross border revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies 
operations fees for offline debit transactions  which are generally signature based debit transactions  are priced similar to credit transactions 
operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions  while cross border offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than cross border online debit transactions 
assessments are primarily based on a customer s gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate gdv 
most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles 
these assessment rates also vary by the type of transaction 
we generally assess at higher rates for cross border volumes compared to domestic volumes 
we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals 
credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions 
in addition  from time to time we may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs 
assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 
in and  gross revenues grew and  respectively 
a component of our revenue growth in each year is attributable to pricing changes 
our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives 
accordingly  we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdv and other performance 
table of contents based support incentives 
rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements 
rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs 
rebates and incentives increased million  or  and million  or  in and  respectively 
these increases reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry  the continued consolidation and globalization of our customers  the growing power of merchants and the impact of pricing changes 
the united states remains our largest geographic market based on revenues 
revenue generated in the united states was approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  generated more than of total revenues in any period 
certain non us economies have experienced stronger growth than the non us economy 
accordingly  some non us revenues grew at a faster rate than us revenues in and the growth was not specifically related to any one region in which we do business 
our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors 
in particular  a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on international travel patterns  which can vary with the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies or the impact of specific events  such as terrorist attacks 
our revenues can also be impacted by a number of factors related to consumer behavior  including consumer confidence in the mastercard brand

table of contents note that the figures in this table may not sum due to rounding not meaningful  see operating expenses and income taxes for more information 
in connection with our ownership and governance transactions in  we reclassified all of our approximately outstanding shares of existing class a redeemable common stock so that our previous stockholders received shares of our class b common stock for each share of class a redeemable common stock that they held prior to the reclassification and a single share of our class m common stock 
accordingly  shares and per share data were retroactively restated in the financial statements subsequent to the reclassification to reflect the reclassification as if it were effective at the start of the first period being presented in the financial statements 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of a million donation of shares of class a common stock to the foundation  a charitable contribution which is not deductible for tax purposes 
see income taxes for more information 
in  we updated gdv to exclude commercial funds transfers in china  which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers 
data for and have been restated to be consistent with this approach 
the data set forth for processed transactions represents all transactions processed by mastercard  including pin based online debit transactions 
in  we updated our transaction detail to remove certain online debit transactions which did not result in a flow of funds  for example balance inquiry or failed transactions 
management determined that it would be more appropriate to exclude such transactions from the processed transactions calculation 
the processed transactions in have been restated to be consistent with the calculation of processed transactions in revenue has not been impacted by this change 
operations fees the significant components in operations fees are as follows for the years ended december  dollar increase decrease percent increase decrease in millions  except percents authorization  settlement and switch currency conversion and cross border acceptance development fees warning bulletin fees connectivity consulting and research fees other operations fees gross operations fees rebates net operations fees authorization  settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems  increasing and in and  respectively 
in  approximately of this increase in revenue was attributable to higher utilization and pricing increases for stand in authorization services 
stand in occurs when the issuer s primary authorization routing options fail and mastercard approves the requests on behalf of the issuer based on pre defined issuer parameters 
these increases in revenues were partially offset in and by and  respectively  due to the implementation of price changes in april to make our pricing compliant with the single european payment area sepa initiative 
the sepa price changes were slightly positive on a total gross revenue basis  however  these changes impact individual revenue categories  in particular authorization  settlement

in addition  settlement revenue increased million in and declined million in relating to foreign exchange gains due to exchange rate volatility on settlement activities 
currency conversion and cross border revenues increased due to an increase in cross border volumes of and in and  respectively  and due to the restructuring of currency conversion pricing in april we restructured our currency conversion pricing by initiating a charge to our issuers  and  in most regions  acquirers for all cross border transactions regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale 
we also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for currency conversion 
of the increases  million and million in and  respectively  were due to the reclassification of certain assessment revenues in europe to cross border volume revenue 
acceptance development fees increased in and primarily due to increased volumes and the introduction of a new fee 
the new fee was implemented in june which resulted in a increase in acceptance development fees in compared to in addition  we began an exclusivity relationship with one merchant in the fourth quarter of that increased transaction volumes and accordingly  acceptance development fees by in warning bulletin fees fluctuate with our customer requests for distribution of invalid or fraudulent account information 
connectivity revenues increased due to increased volumes 
consulting and research fees increased  primarily due to new engagements with our customers in and our business agreements with certain customers may include consulting services as an incentive 
approximately of consulting and research fees in  as compared to in  were generated by new engagements which were provided to customers as a component of incentive agreements 
this type of incentive increases consulting fees and reduces assessments 
other operations fees represent various revenue streams  including cardholder services  compliance and penalty fees  holograms  user pay for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services  and manuals and publications 
no increase in any component of other operations fees was material  other than the following implementation of a new account enhancement program which resulted in an increase of million in transactions from us acquirers with us issuers increased  accordingly  revenue from these transactions increased by million and million in and  respectively 
cardholder services increased million and million in and  respectively  due to an increase in account growth 
rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and  accordingly  increase as these variables increase 
rebates have been increasing due to renewals of customer agreements  ongoing consolidation of our customers and the impact of restructured pricing 
rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were  and in  and  respectively 
assessments assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers gdv 
the components of assessments are as follows for the years ended december  dollar increase decrease percent increase decrease in millions  except percents gross assessments rebates and incentives net assessments 
table of contents gdv growth was and in and  respectively  when measured in local currency terms  and and when measured on a us dollar converted basis 
in  gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within europe 
in  a portion of our gdv growth related to an increase in online debit transactions which are priced at a lower assessment rate compared to credit and offline debit transactions 
accordingly  gross assessments in increased at a lower rate than gdv 
in addition  revenue growth rates in and were impacted by a reclassification of million and million  respectively  from assessments to currency conversion and cross border revenues  offset by million and million  respectively  in pricing increases related to our sepa pricing changes 
the increase in and gross assessments  excluding the net impact of the reclassifications and increase from the april pricing modifications from each period  would have been and  respectively 
rebates and incentives are primarily based on gdv but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards  launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs 
the rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs 
rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were  and in  and  respectively 
as gross assessments increase at a faster rate than rebates and incentives  the ratio of rebates and incentives to gross assessments will decline 
non gdv performance based incentives vary depending on the agreement terms and the timing of our customer s performance 
accordingly  our incentives for non gdv performance metrics  such as the issuance of new cards  the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs  impact the relationship between gross assessments and net assessments 
in  and  rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants

table of contents future obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances 
payments due by period total and thereafter in millions capital leases operating leases sponsorship  licensing other agreements litigation settlements debt total most capital leases relate to certain property  plant and equipment used in our business 
our largest capital lease relates to our kansas city  missouri co processing facility 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business  including the lease on our facility in st 
louis  missouri 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements 
amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the mastercard brand 
the amounts included are fixed and non cancelable 
in addition  these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing  computer hardware maintenance  software licenses and other service agreements 
future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred

debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due june and the principal owed on our series a senior secured notes due september we also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at december  that  among other things  would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members 
our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members behalf or for other reasons 
related parties a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers 
in  the net revenues from these customers were approximately billion  or of total net revenue 
the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income

table of contents addition  as part of our business strategy  mastercard  among other efforts  enters into business agreements with customers 
these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances 
see risk factors business risks we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers  which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in item a of this report 
seasonality during the fourth quarter  a combination of factors may cause our quarter profitability to decline 
while gross revenues can be positively impacted by increases in purchase volume relating to the holiday shopping period  rebates and incentives may also increase 
operating expenses may also be higher than other quarters due to additional advertising and promotions relating to the holiday period plus increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the company s objectives 
critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 
financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly gdv are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance 
total net assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for  and of those net assessment revenues  representing  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our revenue recognition policies are fully described in our consolidated financial statements in item our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly gdv are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers performance 
such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
customers performance is estimated by using historical performance  member reported information  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  revenues may be materially different than initially recorded 
historically  our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than of the estimates on a quarterly basis 
rebates and incentives are estimated 
rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customer s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements 
if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  contra revenues may be materially different than initially recorded 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions legal and regulatory matters we are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters 
except as described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item  mastercard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects 
we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 
discount rate for merchant lawsuit settlement we have entered into a settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit 
this settlement was discounted over the ten year payment term of the settlement 
we estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the settlement agreement in to be 
the discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement  which considered our expected post settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms 
a one percent increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately million in  and declining amounts thereafter 
the reverse impact would be experienced for a one percent decrease in the discount rate 
goodwill and intangible assets except capitalized software we perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
this evaluation utilizes a two step approach 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value 
the test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates  growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions 
the assumptions employed are based on management s judgment using internal and external data 
we utilize independent valuation experts  if needed 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and or intangible assets 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  excluding capitalized software  was million  including million of unamortizable customer relationships  as of december  we determined customer relationships  an intangible asset  have an indefinite life 
in addition to the impairment testing noted above  we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually 
we completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein  and no significant impairment charges were recorded for the year ended december  
table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate  we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we have various tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions  establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may differ by a material amount 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings  respectively  in the period 
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
we considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained 
if upon examination  we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings  in the period 
in certain situations  the company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits 
we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations 
we considered business plans  planning opportunities  and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations 
if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations  additional us income tax expense would have to be recorded which would increase our effective tax rate in that period 
capitalized software our capitalized software  which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use  is included in other intangible assets 
we are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use 
in addition  we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design  development and testing phases of the project 
if actual results are not consistent with our judgments  we may be exposed to an impairment charge 
the net carrying value of capitalized software as of december  was million 
on a quarterly basis  we perform impairment analyses on various technologies 
during the year ended december   no significant impairment charges were recorded 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions pensions and postretirement benefit plans the company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering most of its us employees 
this pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a fixed percentage of eligible pay based on age and service  as well as providing earnings credits based on each participant s account balance 
additionally  the company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by us tax laws 
the company also maintains a postretirement plan providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for most of its us employees and retirees 
the discount rates for the company s pension and postretirement plans are subject to change each year  consistent with changes in high quality  long term corporate bond markets 
to select a discount rate for each plan  we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows determined on pbo basis with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result 
for the pension plan  our discount rate of as of december  is basis points greater than the rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for for the postretirement plan  our discount rate of as of december  is basis points greater than the rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for a quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our pension projected benefit obligation by million  and increase our postretirement projected benefit obligation by million 
these decreases would have a negligible effect on our annual pension and postretirement expense 
an approximately equal  but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate 
certain assumptions are used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans 
key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure each of the plans projected benefit obligation for pension and postretirement  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan 
net actuarial gains and or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans 
we determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets 
the expected rate of our pension plan assets is for the years ended december   and the company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs 
a quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by million 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions postemployment benefit plan we have a formal severance plan which sets forth the guidelines with respect to severance payments to salaried employees whose normal assignment is within the united states 
approximately  of our employees are covered by the plan 
severance benefits are determined primarily by years of service and career level in accordance with either a standard or enhanced payment schedule  which is determined by the cause of the severance action 
certain assumptions are used in the determination of the liability for expected future severance obligations 
key assumptions include the number of severed participants  number of severed individuals by career level  benefit package and discount rate 
the assumption for the number of severed participants used in the calculation was  and for  and  respectively 
the career levels for these individuals was estimated using historical experience as a base  adjusted for a number of strategic and human resource initiatives implemented during these years 
we review historical trends and future expectations when determining the type of benefits to be offered to the severed participants 
the discount rate for our postemployment plan is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in high quality  long term corporate bond markets 
to select a discount rate  we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high grade non callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result 
our discount rate of as of december  is the same as the rate used in calculating the severance obligations for a increase in the number of severed participants would increase our severance obligations by million 
an equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a decrease in the number of participants 
a quarter of a percentage point decrease or increase in our discount rate would have an impact of approximately million on our severance obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk 
we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity price risk 
management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies  which have been approved by the board of directors  governing our funding  investments and use of derivative financial instruments 
we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 
there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at december  as compared to december  foreign exchange risk we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies 
we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
the objective of this activity is 
table of contents to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies  principally the us dollar and euro 
the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than months 
at december  and  forward currency contracts against the us dollar were both purchased with notional amounts of million and million  respectively and sold with notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
based on the year end and foreign exchange positions  the effect of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at million at both december  and at december   there were no forward currency contracts purchased against the euro 
at december   forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased with notional amounts of million

based on the year end foreign exchange positions  the effect of a hypothetical percent weakening of the brazilian real is estimated to create a loss valued at million 
our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of nineteen other transaction currencies 
the remaining transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 
interest rate risk our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments  which we hold as available for sale investments 
with respect to fixed maturities  our general policy is to invest in high quality securities  while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure 
based on the net present value of expected future cash flows  a basis point increase in interest rates  assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve  would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of million and million for and  respectively 
our held to maturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements 
our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of million of subordinated debt securities 
a basis point decrease in rates  assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve  would result in a fair value loss of million and million for december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item at december  and  we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures  settlement service operations and other operational needs
