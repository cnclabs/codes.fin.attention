item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the reader of the company s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company s management 
to that end  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
furthermore  the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
our fiscal year begins on april and ends on march references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  and references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  overview measurement specialties  inc is a leader in the design  development and manufacture of sensors and sensor based systems for original equipment manufacturers and end users  based on a broad portfolio of proprietary technology 
the company is a multi national corporation with nine primary manufacturing facilities strategically located in the united states  china  france  ireland  germany and switzerland  enabling the company to produce and market world wide a broad range of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics 
these sensors are used for automotive  medical  consumer  military aerospace  and industrial applications 
the company s sensor products include pressure sensors and transducers  linear rotary position sensors  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  custom microstructures  load cells  accelerometers  optical sensors  humidity and temperature sensors 
the company s advanced technologies include piezo resistive silicon sensors  application specific integrated circuits  micro electromechanical systems mems  piezoelectric polymers  foil strain gauges  force balance systems  fluid capacitive devices  linear and rotational variable differential transformers  electromagnetic displacement sensors  hygroscopic capacitive sensors  ultrasonic sensors  optical sensors  negative thermal coefficient ntc ceramic sensors and mechanical resonators 
the company continues to expand the business at a relatively high rate through organic growth and through acquisitions 
with the sale of our consumer business effective december   the company had one reportable segment during and  formerly the sensor division 
accordingly  all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the fiscal periods ended march    and exclude the results of discontinued operations  except as otherwise noted 
executive summary the company continues to deliver strong growth in sales and profitability 
over the past four years  the company has grown sales at a compounded rate of per year as a result of consistent organic growth and growth through acquisitions 
we have consummated twelve acquisitions since june with a cumulative purchase price exceeding  establishing new lines of business and or expanding our geographic footprint 
with our rapid expansion and growth has come increased complexity  in terms of products  customers and physical facilities 
to more effectively manage these complexities  in fiscal we reorganized our business into three groups  with a group vice president gvp responsible for the operating performance of their respective group 
along with owning sales and profitability  gvps are responsible for managing the balance sheet  with emphasis on accounts receivable  inventory and capital expenditures 
this increased attention to the balance sheet allowed us to more effectively manage working capital in fiscal  as is evident in our statement of cash flows 
the net change in operating working capital defined as the sum of the net changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable per the statement of cash flows  improved from a negative  in fiscal use of cash to a positive  in fiscal source of cash 
this helped to dramatically improve our free cash flow  or fcf defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of  less purchases of property and equipment of  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal non gaap reconciliation fiscal year ended march  free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations purchases of property and equipment free cash flow the company believes fcf is a better gauge of the company s progress in and a long term driver of shareholder value 
consistent with our strategy to expand our product portfolio and global footprint  we completed two acquisitions in fiscal in november  we acquired the assets of visyx  including novel intellectual property that utilizes a mechanical resonator to measure fluid properties 
under the leadership of our humidity chemical gas temperature optical group htg in toulouse  we have been able to advance the program and introduce production ready prototypes to the market 
while we are very enthusiastic about our progress and the initial customer commitment  we do not anticipate generating material sales until calendar  and accordingly  the investment being made in this technology negatively influenced operating results in fiscal in december we acquired intersema  a manufacturer of pressure sensors and modules 
as a result of front end loaded amortization  higher interest due to increased debt  significant appreciation of the swiss franc and associated foreign currency exchange losses  and specific integration and short term operating issues  intersema s operating results underperformed to our expectations 
despite the shortfall from expectations  we believe we will see meaningful positive earnings per share eps contribution for these acquisitions in fiscal and beyond 
to support the intersema acquisition  we expanded our revolving credit facility in december  by  to  as a result  we have approximately  available under the revolving facility  as well as approximately  in cash 
we believe our strong liquidity positions us well to capitalize on opportunities that will likely arise as a result of the challenging market conditions 
a core tenet of our strategy is providing customized solutions to our customers 
to cost effectively deliver this service  we have expanded our infrastructure in china considerably 
today  approximately of our net sales are manufactured in china and nearly of our global employees are from our china operation 
given our commitment to the region in general  and shenzhen in particular  and in order to mitigate the continued lease cost escalation in the future and add adequate room for expansion  we made the decision two years ago to lease property in shenzhen and build a new facility 
we began construction on a  square foot facility last march  and expect to complete construction late calendar the total estimated investment in the new facility is  at the upper end of our initial estimated range when stated in us dollars  largely due to the appreciation of the chinese renminbi rmb 
in addition to providing a low cost operation from which we can support other regions of the world  our operation in china provides a gateway to drive increased sales in china and asia 
our local sales in china  while relatively small today  are expanding at nearly twice the rate as our average growth rate  and remain a key area of opportunity for the company 
trends there are a number of trends that are likely to have material effects on the company in the future  including our expectations for growth in sales  costs  capital spending  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  changes in debt levels and interest rates and shifts in effective tax rates 
additionally  sales and results of operations could be impacted by additional acquisitions  though there is no specific timetable for any such transaction 
over the past years  we have enjoyed annual organic sales growth of to 
including sales from acquired companies  our compounded annual growth rate from fiscal to fiscal was approximately 
factors that influence our organic growth rate from year to year include our market growth with existing applications and successful introduction of new applications that allow us to gain market share 
in general  we expect the sensor market will continue to expand at a higher rate than overall economic growth as a result of the increase in sensor content in various products across most end markets 
while we believe this market will be robust regardless of economic cycles  our customers are clearly impacted by macro economic trends 
accordingly  we believe our lower organic growth in fiscal as compared to prior years was in part due to slower growth of our customers in certain markets and regions 
additionally  our historical organic growth has been favorably influenced by the growth of our largest customer  sensata 
however  as a result of an in sourcing program  we expect sales with sensata to be relatively flat over the next few years  and therefore reduce our total organic growth as compared to prior years 
for fiscal  we expect total sales of approximately  excluding any additional acquisitions 
gross margins have trended down over the past several year  largely due to unfavorable product sales mix both in terms of organic growth and acquired sales and the impact of the increase in the rmb relative to the us dollar 
growth with sensata over the past several years  which serves primarily the auto market and carries a lower gross margin than our average  has grown faster than our average growth and therefore contributed to the overall decline in gross margin 
additionally  recent acquisitions have operated with a lower gross margin than our pre acquisition average  resulting in a decline in the consolidated margin 
finally  given that the company has more costs than sales denominated in rmb  increases in the rmb relative to the us dollar have resulted in margin erosion 
we have also experienced inflationary increases in raw material commodities and wages  and while we have generally been successful in offsetting these increases with productivity gains  inflationary pressures remain a risk 
while the sales growth rate in fiscal will likely be lower than prior years  we anticipate the mix of sales to improve  in part due to lower proportion of anticipated sales from sensata 
for fiscal  we anticipate our overall average gross margins to be in the range of to as compared to gross margins of and for fiscal years and  respectively 
while gross margin has declined over the last several years  selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percent of sales has declined 
we have been successful in leveraging our sg a expense  growing sg a expense more slowly than our growth in sales 
as a percent of sales  sg a has declined to in fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
given fiscal sales growth will likely be lower than in past years  as well as a result of higher investment in new programs that are not yet generating sales such as our new fluid property sensor  we are not expecting improvement in sg a as a percent of sales in fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets increased dramatically from fiscal to fiscal  associated with the acquisitions completed over those periods 
amortization is disproportionately loaded more in the initial year  and therefore amortization expense is higher in the quarters immediately proceeding a transaction  and declines after the first year based on how various intangible assets are valued and amortized 
with the acquisition of intersema and visyx recently completed  amortization will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal to approximately  in addition to the margin exposure as a result of the depreciation of the us dollar due to higher level of costs than sales denominated in rmb  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures with balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange expense fx due to the revaluation of balance sheet accounts with realized fx transactions and unrealized fx translation adjustments has increased sharply in recent years 
for example  our swiss company  intersema  which uses the swiss franc as their functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss franc 
these transaction and translation losses are reflected in our foreign currency exchange loss 
aside from cash  our foreign entities generally hold receivables in foreign currencies  as well as payables 
in fiscal  we posted a net expense of in realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses associated with the revaluation of foreign assets held in foreign entities 
we would expect to see continued fx expense associated with a weakening us dollar  although we anticipate less change against the euro in fiscal as compared to fiscal we continue to evaluate various global hedging strategies in order to manage this exposure 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate as a result of the allocation of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates and with changes in tax rates 
however  we expect our overall effective tax rate to generally increase due to a more of our total income being generated in europe and the us  which are subject to a higher effective tax rates than our average and b an increase in the china effective tax rate due to changes in the china tax law effective january  the company expects to continue investing in various capital projects in fiscal at a rate comparable to fiscal excluding the investment in the new china facility  capital spending is expected to remain in the range of to of sales

recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new fasb standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the company adopted fin effective april   as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires employers to recognize the under funded or over funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur in comprehensive income 
this standard also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of the statement of financial position 
the recognition provisions of sfas no 
were effective for fiscal years ending after december  the measurement provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  there are two approaches to transition to a fiscal year end measurement date  both of which are applied prospectively 
with the purchase of intersema  the company acquired a defined benefit pension plan 
the company applied the recognition provisions of sfas no 
as of the purchase date and for the year ended march  recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r and fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment to arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
r and sfas no 
require most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
both statements are effective for periods beginning on or after december   and earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas no 
r will be applied to business combinations occurring after the effective date 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before the effective date 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
r and sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
currently  over accounting standards within gaap require or permit entities to measure assets and liabilities at fair value 
prior to sfas no 
 the methods for measuring fair value were diverse and inconsistent  especially for items that are not actively traded 
the standard clarifies that for items that are not actively traded  such as certain kinds of derivatives  fair value should reflect the price in a transaction with a market participant  including an adjustment for risk  not just the company s mark to market value 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the company beginning april  the company is currently quantifying the impact of sfas no 
on its financial statements  but the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff positions that delay for one year the applicability of sfas no 
s fair value measurement requirements to some nonfinancial assets and liabilities  exclude most lease accounting fair value measurements from sfas no 
s scope  and defer the effective date of the aicpa statement of position that defines investment company for purposes of applying the industry specific guidance in an aicpa guide 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb sfas no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  such as debt issuance costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning april  management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company s financial statements  but the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned  which occurs when the following four conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products may be sold with a provision allowing the customer to return a portion of products 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
the company utilizes manufacturing representatives as sales agents for certain of its products 
such representatives do not receive orders directly from customers  take title to or physical possession of products  or invoice customers 
accordingly  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of the company s thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  including worldwide rights to the thinner brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america 
the company has accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf as a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was in fact an up front payment for future lost margins  the majority of the gain on sale has been deferred and was amortized into revenues in future periods over the estimated remaining lives for those products sold to conair 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the sale of the business to conair 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the majority of the company s accounts receivable is due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military and industrial products 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts and other sales allowances 
accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed the company s estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
generally  products that have existed in inventory for months with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may be necessary for additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
cash flows from the purchase and sale of inventory are included in cash flows from operating activities 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
see note for further discussion of the impact of sfas no 
on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at fiscal year end or more frequently under certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  the fair value of the company s reporting units were determined using the implied fair value approach 
this process was completed in the fiscal years ended march   and for asset values as of these respective dates 
according to the guidelines established under sfas no 
 there was no impairment of the company s goodwill 
acquisitions acquisitions are recorded as of the purchase date  and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s best estimates 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog  which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are usually not deductible for tax purposes in stock acquisitions 
however  purchase accounting requires for the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill to the extent the carrying value for financial reporting exceeds the tax basis 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using projected undiscounted cash flow at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
there were no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in  and foreign currency translation and transactions the functional currency of the company s foreign operating companies is the applicable local currency 
the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated comprehensive income loss consists of net income for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in foreign currency exchange in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
however  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany notes of a long term investment nature which management does not intend to repay in the foreseeable future are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income  which is reviewed annually 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required 
consideration of current and expected future taxable income of the company indicated that an overall valuation allowance is not needed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k for a discussion regarding income taxes 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
the company prepares various transfer pricing studies and other such procedures to assist in determining and supporting transfer pricing 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to re determine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
share based payment the company has three active share based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k 
prior to fiscal  the company applied the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees 
there was no employee compensation expense recognized in the income from continuing operations in fiscal as a result of options issued to employees 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r utilizing the modified prospective approach 
this statement replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb under the modified prospective approach  sfas no 
r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding and not vested on april   as well as those that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation cost recognized in the year ended march  includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the company receives a tax deduction for certain stock options and stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the options at the exercise date 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  the company reported all tax benefits resulting from the award of equity instruments as operating cash flows in its consolidated statements of cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company is required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows 
since the company is currently in a net operating loss carry forward position  the company applies the tax law ordering approach  whereby the tax benefits are considered realized for current year exercises of share based compensation awards 
these amounts are considered realized because such deductions offset taxable income on the company s tax return  thereby reducing the amount of income subject to tax 
the current year stock compensation deduction is used to offset taxable income before the nol carry forwards because all current year deductions take priority over nol carry forwards 
when the tax deduction exceeds the compensation expense  the tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is considered an excess tax benefit  or windfall 
the windfall portion of the share based compensation deduction reduces income tax payable and is credited to additional paid in capital apic 
the windfall credited to apic increases the company s apic pool available to offset future tax deficiencies shortfalls 
shortfalls are the amount the compensation expense exceeds the tax deduction

our consolidated net sales increased  or from  to  excluding net sales from the acquisitions of  net sales increased  or defined as organic growth 
all groups posted organic sales growth  with the strongest growth coming from pressure force group pfg and humidity chemical gas temperature optical htg 
pfg net sales increased approximately  or  mainly the result of strong growth in sales to our largest customer  sensata  which primarily services the automotive market  as well as growth with our sensors and transducers in hvac  high purity  industrial and medical applications 
htg net sales increased approximately  or due to continued success of our humidity products in fogging prevention and engine management applications  as well as sense elements used in the measurement of mass air flow 
net sales within position vibration piezo pvg grew 
net sales in position products were down slightly as compared to last year  in part as a result of the phase out of a large  off road customer  offset by sales growth in vibration and piezo products  fueled by continued success of our newly introduced line of accelerometers  as well as various piezo applications in traffic  patient monitoring and consumer applications 
gross margin 
overall  gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in margin is primarily due to several factors including product sales mix  a discrete quality event and the strengthening of the chinese rmb  as well as unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead 
the unfavorable product sales mix is largely associated with increased sales to our largest customer  sensata  which primarily serves the automotive market and carries a lower gross margin than our average 
during the second quarter ended september   the company recorded an accrual of approximately to cover costs associated with the expected scrap and rework resulting from an isolated large return of goods from sensata 
the issue that led to the return  which the company believes has been resolved  was largely attributable to a problem with raw material supplied by one of our vendors 
in addition to this accrual  we incurred approximately in unfavorable direct labor variance in the second quarter associated with this event 
during the twelve months ended march   the chinese rmb exchange rate relative to the us dollar appreciated approximately as compared to the same period last year 
this translates to net amount of approximately  in annualized margin erosion 
also negatively impacting margins was lower absorption of manufacturing overhead in the fourth quarter relative to sales mainly due of the reduction of finished goods inventory and production levels 
operating expense 
operating expenses increased  from  to  as a percent of net sales  operating expense declined to from 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of net sales is the result of net sales increasing at a higher rate as compared to the increase in costs  due to  among other factors  the impact of cost control measures over such areas as professional fees and a decrease in litigation settlement and amortization expense 
approximately  of the overall increase in operating expenses is associated with operating expense from acquisitions completed in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  which include application and development engineering expense  increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a decreased from to 
the increase in sg a is due to approximately  increase in salary and wages  and  increase in non salary research and development r d 
the increase in salaries reflects higher headcount to support the overall growth in sales  and the increase in r d reflects the company s efforts to continually develop new products 
approximately  of the increase in sg a is associated with recently acquired companies  intersema and visyx 
partially offsetting the aforementioned increases in sg a  the prior year operating expenses were higher by approximately due to the costs associated with the closure of the barbados facility  a former operating entity of betatherm 
stock option expense 
stock option expense increased to  stock option expense represents non cash equity based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the increase in stock option expense as compared to the same period last year was primarily the result of the increased number of granted options under the long term employment agreement with our cfo  as well as the annual stock options grant in november 
total compensation cost related to share based payments not yet recognized totaled  at march   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
litigation settlement expenses 
at march   the company accrued  in litigation settlement expenses associated with the settlement of the dewelt and samuel litigation 
the litigation settlement expenses exclude legal fees  which are included in sg a 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles decreased to  for the year ended march   mainly due to higher amortization expense during the initial year after the acquisitions of ysi temperature and betatherm  which were effective april  the amortization expense for intangible assets is higher during the first year mainly because the backlog is fully amortized during the initial year 
the increase in amortization expense associated with the two acquisitions consummated during the quarter ended december  was not as significant due to the close proximity of the transactions to our fiscal year end  but the impact on amortization expense related to these acquisitions is expected to be more significant next year 
interest expense  net 
the  decrease in interest expense to  for the year ended march  is primarily attributed to the decrease in average debt outstanding and lower average interest rates 
overall  average borrowings during fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal average interest rates decreased to from 
the impact on debt outstanding and interest expense associated with the additional borrowings from the acquisitions consummated during the quarter ended december  was not significant due to the proximity of the transactions to our fiscal year end 
the company s interest rate at march  declined to approximately 
foreign currency exchange loss 
in addition to the margin exposure as a result of the depreciation of the us dollar due to higher level of costs than sales denominated in rmb  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures with balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange loss fx due to the revaluation of balance sheet accounts with realized fx transactions and unrealized fx translation adjustments has increased sharply this year due mainly to the changes of the value of the us dollar relative to the chinese rmb and swiss franc 
for example  our swiss company  intersema  which uses the swiss franc as their functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss franc 
aside from cash  our foreign entities generally hold receivables in foreign currency  as well as payables 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate from continuing operations income tax from continuing operations divided by income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately during the year ended march   as compared to last year 
total income tax expense increased  to  as compared to  last year 
the overall increase in income tax expense is because of the overall increase in profits before taxes and the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate 
the company s overall effective tax rate has been impacted by a higher portion of taxable income earned in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates as compared to fiscal  as well as the impact of tax law changes 
the shift of taxable earnings is mainly with the higher earnings in the united states and europe  as a result of continued cost controls  operating leverage  and lower interest expense  in addition to the recent increase in the tax rate in china 
our overall effective tax rate includes the net effect of the tax law changes of or approximately income tax expense tax law change divided by income from continuing operations before income taxes 
approximately of the increase in income tax expense is a result of the non cash income tax expense adjustment recorded for the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in germany resulting from the recent decrease in tax rates 
partially offsetting the increase in income tax expense due to the tax law changes is the impact of tax law changes in china  consisting of the income tax credit associated with the revaluation of the company s china net deferred tax assets at the new higher tax rate and the income tax expense for the withholding tax on distributable earnings 
the company s combined tax rate in germany decreased from approximately to  as a result of the german business tax reform  which became effective on august  the lower german corporate tax rates are effective in fiscal although these lower german tax rates are expected to favorably impact net income because of the resulting decrease in income tax expense associated with profits earned in germany in fiscal and beyond  the company under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  revalued the german net deferred tax assets at the lower combined german tax rate 
the china tax authorities announced an increase in the income tax rate to on december   effective on january  also effective january  is a withholding tax on the distribution of earnings 
the company is pursuing continued qualification as a high technology high tech enterprise with the chinese authority  and if the company obtains the high tech status  the effective income tax rate will be and the company will be subject to the withholding tax 
while the chinese government has provided additional guidance on the criteria to qualify for the high tech status and it is expected ultimately to be decided by the local government authority  the central government guidance is not yet complete at this time and it is delaying the local authority from accepting applications for high tech status 
accordingly  the revaluation of the company s deferred tax assets during fiscal does not consider receiving approval of high tech status 
historically  meas china has been considered a high tech enterprise 
the current guidance on the new china tax law without high tech status graduates the statutory rate from in calendar to in calendar year during the quarter ended march   the company recorded the reversal of a foreign income tax payable  which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of or almost per diluted share 
the income tax payable related to a foreign tax accrual from at least seven years ago  which had been previously considered a liability  however  based on recently discovered documentation  it was determined that the company was not liable for the amounts previously accrued 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate proportionately to the allocation earnings between various taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates and with changes in tax rates 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to generally increase due to more of our total income being generated in europe and the us  which are subject to a higher effective tax rates than our average and the impact of the increase in the china income tax rate effective january  due to  among other things  the volume of manufacturing in the us and our net operating loss carry forwards  we do not expect the american jobs creation act of to have an immediate or significant impact on our effective tax rates 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations primarily consist of the remaining activity associated with the note receivable received by the company in connection with the sale of the consumer segment  which is included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as current and non current portions of promissory note receivable 
for the year ended march   imputed interest income related to the promissory note receivable totaled  which is included in interest expense  net from continuing operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations are reported separately in the statement of cash flows  and the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the future liquidity and capital resources of the company 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages analysis of consolidated statement of operations for the years ended march  percent change change net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general  and administrative non cash equity based compensation sfas r amortization of acquired intangibles litigation settlement expenses total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net foreign currency exchange loss other income income from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes minority interest  net of income taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit due to tax law change income tax expense from continuing operations income tax expense from continuing operations income from continuing operations net sales 
consolidated net sales hit a record annual level in fiscal  and increased  or from  to  net sales from and acquisitions totaled  and organic net sales increased  or  defined as organic growth 
the strong organic growth for the year was primarily the result of growth in sales with our largest customer  sensata  as well as higher sales in the piezo panels  force  optical  humidity and vibration product lines 
growth with sensata was primarily a result of their continued penetration of sensors used in electronic stability control esc systems and direct gas injection applications  as well as the introduction of force sensors used in occupant weight sensing  all of which utilize the company s proprietary micro fused technology 
we enjoyed strong growth in our humidity products  largely as a result of continued penetration of windshield fogging prevention applications  as well as diesel engine management applications for heavy truck and off road equipment 
growth in our piezo panels product line was primarily due to strong sales of sensors used in medical applications and computer business equipment products as compared to last year  as well as strong sales of our recently introduced penetration panels used in security applications and our piezo based traffic sensors 
optical sales increased reflecting higher order demand and broader adoption by a number of medical end use customers 
growth in our vibration products reflected our continued success with our newly introduced line of accelerometers targeting the automotive crash test market and vibration monitoring applications 
finally  with the sale of the consumer business  the sale of our load cells for consumer scale applications are now included in our third party sensor sales  boosting sales for our force products 
gross margin 
overall  gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in margin is primarily due to sales mix  resulting from  among other things  higher sales with our largest customer  sensata  which serves the automotive market and carries lower gross margin than our average  as well as increased optical sales which also carry a lower gross margin 
additionally  we have moved selected low volume  high pressure and or difficult to manufacture oil filled products from our china operation to the fremont operation which has decreased the gross margin in the pressure line  but should result in improved service to our customers 
the change in exchange rate of the rmb relative to the us dollar  along with increased commodity costs  also negatively impacted margins 
operating expense 
operating expenses increased  from  to  as a percent of net sales  operating expense declined to from 
approximately  of the  increase was associated with companies acquired in fiscal or  as well as the increase in stock based compensation expense of  with the adoption of sfas no 
r   increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets  approximately  of compensation expense under the incentive compensation and  in costs associated with the settlement of legal matters 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which includes application and development engineering expense  increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a decreased from to of net sales 
approximately  of the increase in sg a reflects the impact of sg a due to acquired companies 
the majority of the remaining increase is associated with the approximately  incentive compensation expense in fiscal litigation settlement expenses 
at march   the company accrued  in litigation settlement expenses associated with the settlement of the dewelt and samuel litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report filed on form k 
additionally  the company incurred approximately in legal fees during fiscal specifically associated with these two matters which are included in sg a expenses and not included in the litigation settlement expenses 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
the  increase in amortization of acquired intangibles subject to amortization to  for the year ended march   directly relates to the increase in acquired intangible assets and the timing of the acquisitions 
effective april   the company purchased ysi temperature and betatherm  and approximately  in acquired intangible assets were assigned as part of these two acquisitions 
the amortization of intangibles for fiscal represents a full year of amortization 
acquisitions in fiscal were effective at different dates and at the end of fiscal  and the prior year amortization was lower because it did not represent a full twelve months of amortization of acquired intangible assets 
interest expense  net 
the  increase in interest expense to  for the year ended march  is primarily attributed to the increase in average debt outstanding 
overall  average borrowings during fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal average interest rates decreased to from 
the increase in debt was due to the acquisitions 
other expense income  net 
other expense increased to for the year ended march  from for the same period last year 
the fluctuation is mainly attributed to the increase in foreign currency exchange losses of approximately during fiscal  as compared to the prior year  which was mostly due to the change in the rmb exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately during the year ended march   as compared to last year 
the overall decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects certain adjustments recorded during the prior year increasing income tax expenses and a higher portion of taxable income earned during the current fiscal year in tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a adjustment  which increased income tax expense  to revalue us net deferred tax assets based on a lower estimated us effective tax rate resulting from larger apportionment to a state with a lower tax rate 
the impact of the adjustments recorded during the prior year increased the overall tax rate by points 
the company s overall effective rate in was impacted by a higher portion of taxable income earned in tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
the statutory tax rates for trading operations in china and ireland are and  respectively 
additionally  there was a decrease in profitability in the us  which carries a higher tax rate  with the added operating expenses associated with the implementation of sfas r  litigation settlement charges and higher interest expense 
more than offsetting the impact of the jurisdictions with lower tax rates  the company accrued an additional in income tax expense during the quarter ended march  in conjunction with the finalization of the betatherm reorganization in the fourth quarter  and the evaluation of the final structure and tax elections 
discontinued operations 
as part of the sale agreement of the consumer products segment to fervent group limited fgl  the company could have earned an additional  if certain performance criteria sales and margin targets were met within the first year 
at december   the company recorded  of the earn out  because a portion of the earn out targets were met 
the related receivable is included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as current and non current portions of promissory note receivable 
cash flows from discontinued operations are reported separately in the statement of cash flows  and the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the future liquidity and capital resources of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the overall increase in cash balances compared to the prior year is due to several factors 
the company acquired approximately  in cash with purchase of intersema 
additional factors contributing to the increase in cash balances at march  include overall cash generated from operations and maintaining cash balances to promote natural hedging of the foreign exchange exposures with the changes in the value of the rmb and euro relative to the us dollar 
cash balances are expected to decline as the company funds the construction of the new facility in china  pays down debt and implements various strategies to improve cash and working capital management 
cash provided from operating activities was  for the year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the  increase in cash provided by operations is due to several factors 
the net change in accounts receivable and inventory in fiscal was a use of cash totaling  the net change in accounts receivable and inventory in fiscal resulted in a source of cash of  reflecting improved collections of trade receivables and higher inventory turnover 
approximately  of the increase is due to higher income from continuing operations resulting from higher sales and various cost control measures in leveraging sg a 
an additional  of the increase is due to the net increase in the total of all adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 
the total of all adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operation was a net source of cash of  for the year ended march   as compared to a net source of  for the year ended march   due to  among other factors  higher non cash equity based compensation  higher depreciation and amortization  and higher deferred income taxes 
offsetting the above increases in the cash generated from operating cash flows is the net changes in respective operating assets and liabilities and the company payment of  as part of the litigation settlement of the dewelt and samuel cases during the first quarter of fiscal and the decrease in income taxes payable 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended march  as compared to  relative to the corresponding period last year 
the current year amounts are mainly for the acquisitions of visyx and intersema  and the earn out payment for atex 
the atex earn out had been accrued during the prior year since the satisfaction of sales growth objectives had been met 
the prior year amounts are primarily for the acquisitions of ysi temperature and betatherm 
in addition  capital spending was  for the year ended march  compared to  for the year ended march  the increase in capital expenditures can be mainly attributed to the company s new facility in china  as well as various capital projects related to production equipment 
financing activities for the year ended march  provided  of net cash  mainly reflecting additional borrowings to finance the intersema acquisition  partially offset by debt payments  as compared to  provided by financing activities during the same period last year 
the company continues to make revolver payments 
long term debt to support the financing of the acquisitions of ysi temperature and betatherm see note to the consolidated financial statement of the company included in this annual report on form k  effective april   the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement amended and restated credit facility with general electric capital corporation ge which  among other things  increased the company s existing credit facility from  to  consisting of a  revolving credit facility and a  term loan  and lowered the applicable london inter bank offered rate libor or index margin from and  respectively  to libor and index margins of and  respectively 
to support the financing of the acquisition of intersema see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this annual report on form k  the company entered into an amended credit agreement amended credit facility with ge effective december  which  among other things  increased the company s existing revolving credit facility from  to  and lowered the applicable london inter bank offered rate libor or index margin from and  respectively  to libor and index margins of and  respectively 
interest accrues on the principal amount of the borrowings at a rate based on either libor plus a libor margin  or at the election of the borrower  at an index rate prime based rate plus an index margin 
the applicable margins may be adjusted quarterly based on a change in specified financial ratios 
borrowings under the line are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness  dividend payments  financial guarantees  annual capital expenditures  and other related items 
the availability of the revolving credit facility is not based on any borrowing base requirements  but borrowings may be limited by certain financial covenants 
the term portion of the amended credit facility totaled  the term loan is payable in quarterly installments plus interest beginning june  through march   with a final payment of  payable on april  the company has provided a security interest in substantially all of the company s us based assets as collateral for the amended credit facility 
the term loan portion of our credit facility was not changed with the amended credit facility 
at march   the company was in compliance with applicable financial covenants 
as of march   the company utilized the libor based rate for approximately  of the term and revolver borrowings  and the balance utilized the index based rate 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility was approximately at march  as of march   the outstanding borrowings on the revolver  which is classified as long term debt  were   and the company had the right to borrow up to an additional  under the revolving credit facility 
the company s borrowing capacity is limited by financial covenant ratios  and at march   the company could borrow an additional  commitment fees on the unused balance were equal to 
per annum of the average amount of unused balances 
promissory notes in connection with the acquisition of intersema  the company issued unsecured promissory notes intersema notes denominated in swiss francs totaling  of which  is classified as current at march  the intersema notes are payable in four annual installments of  beginning december  and bear an interest rate of per year 
other short term debt in connection with the acquisition of entran  humirel  hlp  and atex  the company assumed outstanding short term borrowings 
at march   of this assumed short term borrowing was outstanding and these amounts were paid during additionally  the company had  in short term debt at march   which was refinanced by the revolver during in connection with the amended credit facility 
liquidity at march   we had approximately  of available cash and  of borrowing capacity under the amended credit facility 
this cash balance includes cash of  in china which is subject to certain restrictions on the transfer to another country because of currency control regulations  but can be used without such restrictions for general business purposes in china 
we believe the company s financial position  ability to generate cash and availability under credit facilities will be sufficient to meet funding of day to day and material short and long term commitments for the foreseeable future 
future cash outlays for income taxes are not expected to exceed income tax expense  because of the utilization of us and german net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  we believe the company s capital resources are sufficient to cover commitments for capital expenditures  based on our anticipated sources of funds to fill these commitments  including cash generated from operations and our ability to borrow 
other comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income for the period and the impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the increase in other comprehensive income from the changes in the exchange rates is primarily due to the changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  rmb  hong kong dollar  japanese yen  and swiss franc 
dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
additionally  the payment of dividends is prohibited under our credit agreement with ge 
we intend to retain earnings to support our growth strategy and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
at present  there are no material restrictions on the ability of our hong kong and european subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans  advances  or purchases of materials  products  or services 
chinese laws and regulations  including currency exchange controls  however  restrict distribution and repatriation of dividends by our china subsidiary 
seasonality as a whole  there is no material seasonality in our sales 
however  general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results  and certain end use markets experience certain seasonality 
for example  european sales are often lower in summer months and oem sales are often stronger immediately preceding and following the introduction of new products 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our prices generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low 
however  we have experienced some significant increases in materials costs  and as a result  we have suffered a decline in margin 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
aggregate contractual obligations as of march   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows contractual obligations payment due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations interest obligation on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term obligations capital additions china facility total operating lease obligations are not reduced for annual sublease rentals of approximately 
other long term obligations on the company s balance sheet under gaap primarily consist of obligations under warranty polices and tax liabilities 
the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management s estimate over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based on historical experience 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a certain level of foreign currency exchange risk 
we are exposed to foreign currency transaction and translation losses  which might result from adverse fluctuations in the value of the euro  hong kong dollar  swiss franc  japanese yen  and chinese renminbi 
our products are manufactured and marketed worldwide 
a substantial portion of our revenues are priced in us dollars 
most of our costs and expenses are priced in us dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese renminbi  euros  swiss francs and japanese yen 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the us dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
refer to item  business  foreign operations for details concerning annual net sales invoiced from our facilities within the us and outside of the us and as a percentage of total net sales for the last three years  as well as net assets and the related functional currencies 
the renminbi has appreciated by   and during  and  respectively 
the chinese government announced that it will no longer peg the renminbi to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the renminbi trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
the company has more expenses in renminbi than sales ie  short renminbi position  and as such  when the us dollar weakens relative to the renminbi  our operating profits decrease 
based on our net exposure of renminbi to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate a negative operating income impact of approximately for every appreciation in renminbi against the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and have considered  but do not currently use  foreign currency contracts as a hedging strategy 
we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the us dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the us dollar 
the company s french and germany subsidiaries have more sales in euro than expenses in euro and the company s swiss subsidiary has more expenses in swiss franc than sales  and as such  if the us dollar weakens relative to the euro and swiss franc  our operating profits increase in france and germany but decline in switzerland 
based on the net exposures of euros and swiss francs to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a positive operating income impact of in euros and a negative income impact of for every appreciation in euro and swiss franc  respectively  relative to the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and associated cost increases or currency hedging 
the company has a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in europe  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
these currency contracts have a total notional amount of  with exercise dates through june at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar conversion rate 
since these derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no
