item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
revenue from our three core markets accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   while revenue from our outsourced services accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we are organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is one reportable business segment  while the electronics group includes two reportable business segments  aerospace defense and test measurement 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
the aerospace defense reportable segment is comprised of sypris data systems  inc and sypris electronics  llc 
revenue for this group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace defense electronics 
the test measurement reportable segment consists solely of sypris test measurement  inc  which generates revenue primarily from providing technical services for the calibration  certification and repair of test and measurement equipment in the us our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback  which is deemed uncollectible 
impairments 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by calculating the estimated fair value of each business with which goodwill is associated 
the estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner 
table of contents that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different fair value for a business if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
at december   net assets of our test measurement segment were million  including goodwill of million  and our aerospace defense segment had net assets of million  including goodwill of million 
if continued improvements in operations are not achieved and profitability deteriorates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill for the test measurement and or the aerospace defense segments 
long term contracts 
a large part of our aerospace defense segment business is derived from long term contracts for development  production and service activities  which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature  as applicable 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
primarily  we record long term  fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing net revenue 
revenue is recognized on these contracts when units are shipped or delivered to the customer  as applicable  with unit revenue based upon unit prices as set forth in the applicable contracts 
the costs attributed to contract revenue are based upon the estimated average costs of all units to be shipped 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our encryption programs 
in less frequent circumstances  we enter into milestone specific  fixed price contracts for which revenue is recorded when we achieve performance milestones 
revenue recognized under such milestones is limited to net revenue that we would recognize under the cost to cost method 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
for example  we use this methodology for our cec  common card and ki programs 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record net revenue 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
an example of this type of revenue recognition includes the information assurance engineering services program 
as a general rule  we recognize net revenue and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenue and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
the majority of our aerospace defense segment net revenue is driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government  and therefore not necessarily on market based factors 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  public relations and interest expense are unallowable  and therefore  not recoverable through net revenue 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery during  and  respectively 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones or cost to cost during  and  respectively 
therefore  the amounts we record in our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
in addition to less formal monthly reviews  management in the aerospace defense segment formally assesses the status of contracts on a quarterly basis through extensive estimate at completion reviews  which include multiple levels of program personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
pension plan funded status 
the calculation of pension assets and liabilities involve complex estimation processes based on third party actuarially determined estimates  which rely on management estimates of the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets 
changes in these rates could significantly impact the actuarially determined amounts recorded in the statements of financial position 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory 
we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market and we reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions using the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes as required by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates 
as referenced in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  as of january  management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
in addition  under fin judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
the company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses 
in the us  the company had a net deferred tax liability at december  us operations have not been profitable in recent years  however 
if unprofitable results continue  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on the resulting deferred tax assets 
the company s foreign operation had a net deferred tax asset at december  the company has been profitable in its foreign operations and anticipates continuing profitability in the future 
no valuation allowances were recorded during  or 
table of contents results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our consolidated results of operations from one year to another  present the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue

the industrial group derives its revenue from manufacturing services and product sales 
net revenue in the industrial group for the year increased million to million primarily due to million in additional volume  million of material pricing pass through and million of price increases which were offset by the cessation of two business lines 
the aerospace defense segment derives its revenue from product sales and technical outsourced services 
aerospace defense segment net revenue decreased million to million due to a million decline in volume as a result of one encryption product completing its life cycle during  while the launch of the next generation product was delayed into  as well as maturing manufacturing service programs and declines in data storage product sales 
all such decreases were partially offset by million of pricing increases over the prior year  primarily driven by a manufacturing service program 
the test measurement segment derives its revenue from technical services including calibration and component screening  and product sales 
technical services revenue accounted for approximately and of total test measurement revenue in and  respectively 
test measurement segment net revenue decreased million due to a million sales decline in a military program product  with the remainder due to decreased technical services sales

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in and increased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in the increase was primarily driven by a million increase in stock compensation expense as required under sfas no 
r  a million increase in administrative costs in the industrial group related to a full year of additional infrastructure to support the new contracts in the industrial group  and a million increase in allowances for bad debts for the aerospace defense segment  all of which were partially offset by a decrease for the test measurement segment primarily resulting from reduced headcount and severance costs in the prior period which did not recur 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased million in due to a million reduction in two of our data systems product development projects  which was partially offset by new intellectual property investments under a manufacturing service program and initial investments in a new product offering within our aerospace defense segment

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash used in operating activities was million in  as compared to net cash provided of million in  primarily due to the timing of working capital improvements in  which were not repeated in and the return to pre chapter payment terms under the settlement agreement with dana 
additionally  net cash used in operating activities is due to the timing of collections and includes increases in inventory to support the ramp up of new product programs in the aerospace defense segment 
in  accounts receivable increased million primarily due to the timing of collections from governmental agencies  and accounts payable decreased million driven by lower volumes in the industrial group 
inventory decreased million primarily to adjust for lower sales volumes in the industrial group and due to an emphasis on reducing inventory days 
other current assets increased million primarily as a result of an increase in deferred contract costs 
accrued liabilities increased million primarily as a result of foreign income taxes payable resulting from the dana settlement agreement and a customer payment received in advance 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in capital expenditures decreased slightly to million in from million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to cash used of million in in  we made net repayments totaling million on our revolving credit facility as a result of cash flow from operations under our various working capital management initiatives 
additionally  we also paid million in financing fees in conjunction with modifications of our debt in we had total borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million at december   and an unrestricted cash balance of million 
approximately million of the unrestricted cash balance relates to our mexican subsidiaries 
in april  our revolving credit agreement was amended and restated to limit total borrowings at million  with million of additional borrowings available upon lead bank approval  and to extend the credit agreement through october we also amended the senior notes in april  repaid million of principal and modified the june  principal payment to june  the amendments for the senior notes and revolving credit agreement also increased our interest rates  revised certain financial covenants and added a security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
other terms of the revolving credit agreement and senior notes remain substantially unchanged 
standby letters of credit up to a maximum of million may be issued under the credit agreement of which million were issued at december  our principal commitments at december  consisted of repayments of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and senior notes  pension obligations and obligations under operating leases for certain of our real property and equipment 
estimated pension contributions for are expected to range from million to million 
we also had purchase commitments totaling approximately million at december   primarily for inventory and manufacturing equipment 
the following table provides the payment dates of our debt and contractual lease obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt amounts in thousands thereafter revolving credit facility senior notes operating leases total due to the uncertainty with the respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

table of contents at december  we also had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income  which will expire on december  we believe that sufficient resources will be available to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our assessment of the availability of funds for the next twelve months is based in part on our intent and ability to continue to own the shares of common stock of dan received through the settlement agreement reached in august we will continue to monitor the market price and the factors impacting the market price of the dan common stock 
we expect to own our shares of the dan common stock until the value indicated by the market price approximates the estimated recoverable amount we recognized at the time of the settlement agreement 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on our profitability  our ability to manage working capital requirements and our rate of growth 
if we make significant acquisitions  if our largest customers experience financial difficulty  or if working capital and capital expenditure requirements exceed expected levels during the next twelve months or in subsequent periods  we may require additional external sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that any additional required financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity financings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are currently not required to be measured at fair value 
under sfas no 
 entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with a few exceptions  as long as it is applied to the instrument in its entirety 
the fair value option election is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
the statement establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity s election on its earnings 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  the company is currently analyzing the potential adoption and impact  if any  of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
sfas no 
r will be applied to acquisitions in the future 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment to arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements  but separate from the equity of the parent company 
the statement further requires that consolidated net income be reported at amounts attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest  rather than expensing the income attributable to the minority interest holder 
this statement also requires that companies provide sufficient disclosures to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent company and the interests of the noncontrolling owners  including a disclosure on the face of the consolidated statements for income attributable to the noncontrolling interest holder 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all additional borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the london interbank offered rate libor  or certain alternative short term rates  plus a margin at december  based upon our leverage ratio 
a change in interest rates of basis points would result in additional interest expense of less than million on an annualized basis  based upon our debt outstanding at december  a change in fixed interest rates of basis points would change the fair value of our senior notes by million 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have historically impacted our earnings only to the extent of remeasurement gains related to us dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiary  because the vast majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
a one percent change in foreign currency exchange rates would result in remeasurement gain or loss of approximately million on an annualized basis  based upon the us dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiary at december  inflation has not been a significant factor in our operations in any of the periods presented  however  there can be no assurances that the costs of steel will not adversely affect our working capital requirements and our associated interest costs  which could also increase the sensitivity of our results to changes in interest rates 
with respect to our ownership of common stock in dan  we are also subject to equity price risk 
on january   the company received approximately million shares of dan common stock in its initial distribution from the bankrupt estate 
subsequent distributions are anticipated following the resolution of disputed matters within the estate 
the company anticipates receiving approximately million additional shares following the resolution of these matters 
based on these assumptions  a permanent change of per share in the value of dan stock would change the fair value of our holdings by approximately million
