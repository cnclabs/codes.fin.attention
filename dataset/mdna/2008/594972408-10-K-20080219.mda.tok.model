the microstrategy mission is to empower every business user to make more informed decisions by providing timely  relevant and accurate answers to their business questions 
to achieve this mission  microstrategy s single  integrated platform is designed to support various styles of business intelligence through an easy to use interface 
microstrategy provides sophisticated analytical performance to business users in the format that suits them best  from high level dashboards to custom reports and advanced analysis via e mail  web  fax  wireless and voice communication channels 
microstrategy engineers its software for reliability  scalability  security and ease of administration for organizations of all sizes 
leading companies and government organizations worldwide have chosen microstrategy as their enterprise business intelligence standard 
our software platform  microstrategy  enables users to query and analyze the most detailed  transaction level databases  turning data into business intelligence and delivering boardroom quality reports and alerts about the users business processes 
our web based architecture provides reporting  security  performance and standards that are critical for web deployment 
our products can be deployed on company intranets to provide employees with information to make better  more cost effective business and management decisions 
by integrating information from across the enterprise  solutions built on the microstrategy platform are designed to give analysts  managers and executives the critical insight they need to make better business and management decisions and to optimize their operations 
with extranet deployments  enterprises can use microstrategy to build stronger relationships by linking customers and suppliers via the internet 
microstrategy facilitates customer success with a comprehensive offering of consulting  education  technical support and technical advisory services for our customers and strategic partners 
we were incorporated as a delaware corporation on november  industry background business intelligence software offers decision makers the opportunity to ask and answer questions about data that has been captured but not yet fully exploited 
four key business needs have driven demand for business intelligence solutions increase user access and scalability in the past  dissemination of information has been limited to a few power users or analysts 
now a wide range of information customers from customer service representatives to the ceo within a company and from customers to suppliers outside the organization demand and can benefit from the insight that business intelligence can provide 
the wide acceptance of the internet as an information source also has fueled demand for enterprise data to be accessible over the web to tens of thousands of users across the enterprise 
increase data scalability increasing information generation  and in particular  the ability to capture electronically and store every business transaction has made terabyte size data warehouses commonplace 
terabyte size data warehouses store one trillion bytes of data or more and are among the largest databases in the world 
while transaction level information is now routinely captured  organizations can struggle to make productive use of such massive data stores 
organizations need to view data within the operational context of the data making even the most detailed information meaningful to business users 
as a result  users want to be able to discover easily trends hidden in these very large databases  and verify these trends by reviewing the underlying transaction detail 
improve supply efficiency supplier transactions become more efficient with direct access to inventory and other related data 
however  for true vendor managed inventory and collaborative commerce systems  vendors also need to have access to key information about how their products are performing against business metrics 
for example  vendors should be able to see how their products are selling in each geographic region so as not to over ship products that are slow moving or under ship products that are selling quickly 
by opening vendor performance information to the vendors themselves  buyers and sellers of goods and services become partners in the quest to optimize sales  margin and inventory 
improve distribution efficiency business partners collaborate more effectively with access to shared data 
by granting partners access to information such as the manufacturing pipeline and build schedule  partners can be more effective at satisfying demands of end customers and setting expectations 
furthermore  opening invoice and purchase order information to partners can enable them to reduce the overhead associated with channel management  resulting in cost savings and time efficiencies 
for example  notifying channel sales partners of changes in the manufacturing schedule allows them to reset end customer expectations or to increase selling activity 
the emergence and widespread acceptance of the internet as a medium of communication and commerce have changed the way businesses interact with each other and their customers by allowing businesses to establish new revenue streams  create new distribution channels and reduce costs 
simultaneously  the amount of corporate information stored in databases continues to grow exponentially  and companies are giving an increasing number of employees  customers and suppliers access to their information 
business intelligence tools are one of the gateways to this information 
for example  companies are using internet based systems to facilitate business operations  including sales automation  supply chain management  marketing  customer service and human resource management 
consumers are also becoming increasingly sophisticated in their use of the internet  relying on the internet not only to make online purchases  but also to perform price comparisons  analyze recommendations from like minded individuals  educate themselves about relevant products and offerings and enter into transactions that were once conducted face to face or via the telephone 
the integration of the internet into business processes and increased consumer sophistication create opportunities for companies to use business intelligence applications as part of a more dynamic business model 
factors driving demand for these applications include increased electronic capture of transaction  operational and customer information 
the rapid growth in the electronic capture of business information and the increased availability of related profile data on the parties or products involved in each transaction are providing businesses with a rich data foundation for performing various analyses and making decisions 
powerful data analysis and mining tools are required to sift through massive amounts of data to uncover information regarding customer interactions  trends  patterns and exceptions  in turn enabling organizations to provide superior service and products to customers 
need to create a personalized  one to one customer and or supplier experience while maintaining privacy 
many companies have implemented strategies that establish personalized relationships with each customer and or supplier based on individual needs and preferences  and earn their loyalty by providing superior service  security and convenience 
in order to successfully acquire  retain and upgrade customers  organizations need to understand their profiles  their transaction history  their past responses to marketing campaigns  and their interactions with customer service 
retrieving information from widely dispersed and complex data sources and providing a holistic view of the customer can be challenging 
at the same time  while businesses have the opportunity to collect a variety of information that could improve targeting  customers are concerned about the potential for loss or abuse of their privacy 
need to integrate online and traditional operations 
while there are substantial benefits to conducting business electronically  companies need to ensure that their online operations work in combination with their traditional operations 
companies are seeking to ensure that an order placed online can be reliably fulfilled according to the expectations of the customer and to develop and maintain consistent interactions with customers across different channels 
maintaining the integrity of  and enhancing  the customer experience are crucial to fostering customer loyalty and supply chain relationships 
increased openness of business intelligence applications to customers  suppliers and partners 
business intelligence systems are no longer confined to the organization 
today  companies are extending their business intelligence insight to suppliers  channel partners and customers via extranets 
business partners can have up to the minute access to sales histories  inventory status and billing information through their web browsers

business users can rearrange the organization of any report with simple drag n drop actions or by clicking on the toolbar icons to get views of the data  all from the same report and without requiring assistance from it 
integration of analysis in every report or scorecard 
microstrategy makes the same powerful analytic capability available directly from enterprise reports or scorecards automatically 
microstrategy delivers analytic integration to reporting users in two ways 
the first is by providing on line analytical processing olap capabilities directly to tables embedded within report documents  allowing business users to analyze the data within the table while staying within the bigger report document 
the second way is by allowing users to drill from a report document to a dedicated analysis view that is optimized for conducting detailed analysis 
in both cases  the integration of reporting with analysis is automatic 
direct access to sap bw  microsoft analysis services and hyperion essbase

in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy faces competitors in several broad categories  including business intelligence software  analytical processes  query and web based reporting tools  and report delivery 
independent competitors that are primarily focused on business intelligence products include  among others  actuate  information builders and the sas institute 
we also compete with large software corporations  including suppliers of enterprise resource planning software that provide one or more capabilities competitive with our products  such as ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap ag  infor and others  and with open source business intelligence vendors  including pentaho  jaspersoft and others 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
for example  oracle acquired hyperion solutions in april  ibm acquired cognos in january and sap acquired business objects in january by doing so  these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
research and product development we have made  and continue to make  substantial investments in research and product development 
we believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
as of december   our research and product development staff consisted of employees  of whom work on our core business intelligence projects and of whom work on research and development relating to our angel 
com and alarm 
com businesses 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees  of whom were based in the united states and were based internationally 
of the total of  employees  were engaged in sales and marketing  in research and development  in technical support  consulting and education services  and in finance  administration and corporate operations 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we believe that effective recruiting  education and nurturing of human resources are critical to our success and have traditionally made investments in these areas in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition  increase employee loyalty and create a culture conducive to creativity  cooperation and continuous improvement 
all newly hired technical and sales professionals complete a professional orientation course that ranges from one day to four weeks long 
the curriculum consists of lectures  problem sets and independent and group projects  covering data on our products  competitors and customers 
certain lectures also deal with general business practices  ethics and teamwork 
throughout this training  students typically must pass a number of oral and written examinations in order to begin their assignments 
course content is created by experienced members of our professional staff  who generally have an annual obligation to update course content based upon the best practices they have most recently observed in the field 
this expert content is then used to upgrade and revitalize our education  consulting  support  technology and marketing operations

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing microstrategy 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  in part  as a result of the size  timing  volume and execution of significant orders and shipments  the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  the timing of new product announcements by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  the length of our sales cycles  seasonal factors  such as our traditionally lower pace of new license transactions in the summer  changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  our use of direct and indirect distribution channels  utilization of our consulting and education services  which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software products  the quarterly performances of our alarm 
com and angel 
com business units  which are highly variable and particularly difficult to forecast  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our profitability and expectations for future profitability and its effect on our deferred tax assets and net income for the period in which any adjustment to our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be made  increases or decreases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 and changes in customer budgets 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  such as office leases and certain personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 
the trading price for our class a common stock has been and may continue to be volatile the trading price of our class a common stock historically has been volatile and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  new products  significant contracts  commercial relationships or capital commitments  the emergence of new sales channels in which we are unable to compete effectively  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  commencement of  or our involvement in  litigation  any major change in our board or management  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals  recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates  announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations  the likelihood of which may be enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance relating to our anticipated financial performance in future periods  announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations  the volume of shares of class a common stock available for public sale  sales of stock by us or by our stockholders  short sales  hedging and other derivative transactions involving shares of our class a common stock  and general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our class a common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
revenue recognition accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported results of operations we continuously review our compliance with all new and existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements 
depending upon the outcome of these ongoing reviews and the potential issuance of further accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines and interpretations  we may be required to modify our reported results  revenue recognition policies or business practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes and non income taxes in a variety of domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings that are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and earnings that are higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits under fin  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles or interpretations thereof 
our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities 
any adverse outcome of such a review could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and  in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
moreover  as a multinational business  we have subsidiaries that engage in many intercompany transactions in a variety of tax jurisdictions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we also have contingent tax liabilities that  in management s judgment  are not probable of assertion 
if such unasserted contingent liabilities were to be asserted  or become probable of assertion  we may be required to record significant expenses and liabilities in the period in which these liabilities are asserted or become probable of assertion 
as a result of these and other factors  the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may materially affect our financial results in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined 
if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still evolving 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior and european and other governmental restrictions on the collection and use of personal data may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for business intelligence software  analytical applications and information delivery are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many companies in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products 
microstrategy faces competitors in several broad categories  including business intelligence software  analytical processes  query and web based reporting tools  and report delivery 
independent competitors that are primarily focused on business intelligence products include  among others  actuate  information builders and the sas institute 
we also compete with large software corporations  including suppliers of enterprise resource planning software that provide one or more capabilities competitive with our products  such as ibm  microsoft  oracle  sap ag  infor and others  and with open source business intelligence vendors  including pentaho  jaspersoft and others 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
for example  oracle acquired hyperion solutions in april  ibm acquired cognos in january and sap acquired business objects in january by doing so  these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain technical support revenues from our installed customer base 
we depend on revenue from a single suite of products our microstrategy suite of products accounts for a substantial portion of our revenue 
because of this revenue concentration  our business could be harmed by a decline in demand for  or in the prices of  our microstrategy software as a result of  among other factors  any change in our pricing model  increased competition  a maturation in the markets for these products or other risks described in this document 
business disruptions could affect our operating results a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a single facility in northern virginia 
we are also a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services 
a major earthquake  fire  act of terrorism or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we use strategic channel partners and if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition to our direct sales force  we use strategic channel partners such as value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to license and support our products 
for the year ended december   transactions by channel partners for which we recognized revenues accounted for  of our total product licenses revenues 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including products that compete with ours 
because our channel partners generally do not have an exclusive relationship with us  we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or provide adequate resources to selling our products 
moreover  divergence in strategy or contract defaults by any of these channel partners may materially adversely affect our ability to develop  market  sell or support our products 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product licenses revenues  we seek to maintain a significant level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners 
there can be no assurance that our strategic partners will continue to cooperate with us when our distribution agreements expire or are up for renewal 
in addition  there can be no assurance that actions taken or omitted to be taken by such parties will not adversely affect us 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our strategic partners 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we rely on our strategic channel partners to operate in accordance with the terms of their contractual agreements with us 
for example  our agreements with our channel partners limit the terms and conditions pursuant to which they are authorized to resell or distribute our software and offer technical support and related services 
we also typically require our channel partners to represent to us the dates and details of product license transactions sold through to end user customers 
if our strategic channel partners do not comply with their contractual obligations to us  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our recognition of deferred revenue and advance payments and future customer purchase commitments is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods our gross current and long term deferred revenue and advance payments totaled million as of december  we offset our accounts receivable and deferred revenue for any billed and unpaid items  which totaled million  resulting in net deferred revenue and advance payments of million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on various factors  including our performance of various service obligations 
we have also entered into certain additional agreements that include future minimum commitments by our customers to purchase products  product support or other services through totaling approximately million 
these future commitments are not included in our deferred revenue balances 
because of the possibility of customer changes or delays in customer development or implementation schedules or budgets  and the need for us to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue and advance payments at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future we generated net income for each of the years ended december   and  however  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly or revenues fall below our expectations  we may cease to be profitable and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we have significant deferred tax assets  and if we are unable to sustain profitability  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets  which would result in a charge that would adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred 
managing our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition we receive a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales from foreign direct and indirect operations 
international sales accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  export restrictions and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products  lack of acceptance of localized products  difficulties in and costs of staffing  managing and operating our international operations  tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  weaker intellectual property protection  economic weakness or currency related crises  the burden of complying with a wide variety of laws  including labor laws  generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  our ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures  and political instability in the countries where we are doing business 
in addition  compliance with foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions  and our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations 
these laws and regulations include import and export requirements  us laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act  and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials 
although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws  there can be no assurance that our employees  partners and other persons with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or these laws 
any violations of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  including substantial fines or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries  and could also materially damage our reputation  our brand and our international expansion efforts 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which could reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products and purchase our consulting and other services 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while it seeks internal approval for the purchase of our products and or services 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size and or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products and complete consulting engagements can vary widely 
implementing our product can take several months  depending on the customer s needs  and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
our results in any particular period may depend upon the number and volume of large transactions in that period and these transactions may involve more lengthy  complex and unpredictable sales cycles than other transactions as existing and potential customers seek to standardize on a single business intelligence vendor  our business may experience larger transactions at the enterprise level and larger transactions may account for a greater proportion of our business 
the presence or absence of one or more large transactions in a particular period may have a material positive or negative effect on our revenue and operating results for that period 
during  our top three product license transactions totaled approximately million in revenue recognized  compared to million  including one transaction with million in revenue recognized  during  or and of total product licenses revenues during and  respectively 
these transactions represent significant business and financial decisions for our customers and require considerable effort on the part of customers to assess alternative products and require additional levels of management approval before being concluded 
they are also often more complex than smaller transactions 
these factors generally lengthen the typical sales cycle and increase the risk that the customer s purchasing decision may be postponed or delayed from one period to another subsequent or later period or that the customer will alter his purchasing requirements 
the sales effort and service delivery scope for larger transactions also require additional resources to execute the transaction 
these factors could result in lower than anticipated revenue and earnings for a particular period or in the reduction of estimated revenue and earnings in future periods 
a slowdown or downturn in the financial services industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations we have a significant number of customers in the financial services industry 
when there is a slowdown or downturn in the financial services industry  financial services firms may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology 
in addition  financial services customers may delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts 
also  customers with excess information technology resources may choose to take their availability solutions in house rather than obtain those solutions from us 
moreover  competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers to lower cost solutions 
prior downturns in the financial services industry have seen an increase in the pace of industry consolidation  which if repeated could result in reduced overall spending on our products 
if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we face a variety of risks in doing business with the us and foreign governments  various state and local governments  and agencies  including risks related to the procurement process  budget constraints and cycles  termination of contracts and audits our customers include the us government and a number of state and local governments or agencies 
there are a variety of risks in doing business with government entities  including procurement 
contracting with public sector customers is highly competitive and can be time consuming and expensive  requiring that we incur significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract 
budgetary constraints and cycles 
demand and payment for our products and services are impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding availability  with funding reductions or delays adversely impacting public sector demand for our products and services 
termination of contracts 
public sector customers often have contractual or other legal rights to terminate current contracts for convenience or due to a default 
if a contract is terminated for convenience  which can occur if the customer s needs change  we may only be able to collect for products or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses 
if a contract is terminated because of default  we may not recover even those amounts  and we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services 
audits 
the us government and state and local governments and agencies routinely investigate and audit government contractors for compliance with a variety of complex laws  regulations  and contract provisions relating to the formation  administration or performance of government contracts  including provisions governing reports of and remittances of fees based on sales under government contracts  price protection  compliance with socio economic policies  and other terms that are particular to government contracts 
if  as a result of an audit or review  it is determined that we have failed to comply with such laws  regulations or contract provisions  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  cost associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses  fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business  and we may suffer harm to our reputation 
our customers also include a number of foreign governments and agencies 
similar procurement  budgetary  contract and audit risks also apply to our doing business with these entities 
in addition  compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources 
in certain jurisdictions our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market 
each of these difficulties could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties  and the loss of this technology could impair our software  delay implementation of our products or force us to pay higher license fees we license third party technologies that we incorporate into our existing products 
there can be no assurance that the licenses for such third party technologies will not be terminated or that we will be able to license third party software for future products 
in addition  we may be unable to renegotiate acceptable third party license terms 
changes in or the loss of third party licenses could lead to a material increase in the costs of licensing or to our software products becoming inoperable or their performance being materially reduced  with the result that we may need to incur additional development costs to ensure continued performance of our products  and we may experience a decreased demand for our products 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our vice chairman  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time and require significant research and development expenditures to develop and test new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or new customer requirements  nor can we be sure that any new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
moreover  even if we introduce such a product  we may experience a decline in revenues of our existing products that is not fully matched by the new product s revenue 
for example  customers may delay making purchases of a new product to permit them to make a more thorough evaluation of the product  or until industry and marketplace reviews become widely available 
some customers may hesitate migrating to a new product due to concerns regarding the complexity of migration and product infancy issues on performance 
in addition  we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor s product rather than migrate to our new product 
this could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and materially affect our business 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect the demand for our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our products 
microstrategy currently supports sql and mdx standards in database access technology 
if we are unable to adapt our products on a timely basis to new standards in database access technology  the ability of microstrategy s products to access customer databases could be impaired 
in addition  the emergence of new standards in the field of operating system support could adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
microstrategy technology is currently compatible with nearly all major operating systems  including  among others  windows server  sun solaris  ibm aix  hp s hp ux  red hat linux as and suse linux enterprise server 
if a different operating system were to gain widespread acceptance  we may not be able to achieve compatibility on a timely basis  resulting in an adverse effect on the demand for our products 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors and or defects 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in our products after their introduction 
despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue  damage to our reputation or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may also have to expend resources and capital to correct these defects 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability  warranty and other claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions and we may be exposed to product liability  warranty and other claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products  services and brand we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual commitments to protect our proprietary information 
despite our efforts  these measures can only provide limited protection 
unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property 
any patents owned by us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use  we may not remain competitive 
third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights we periodically receive notices from others claiming we are infringing their intellectual property rights  principally patent rights 
we expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows  the functionality of products overlap  and the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could be time consuming  costly and or result in litigation  divert management s time and attention from developing our business  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable  require us to stop selling certain of our products  require us to redesign certain of our products using alternative non infringing technology or practices  which could require significant effort and expense  or require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
for example on november  diagnostic systems corp 
dsc  a subsidiary of acacia technology group  filed a complaint for patent infringement against microstrategy and a number of other unrelated defendants in the united states district court for the central district of california  southern division 
the case has been consolidated with case no 
sa cv ag mlgx pending against other unrelated defendants 
the consolidated complaint accuses microstrategy of infringing us patent no 
 directly  contributorily and by inducement by making  using  selling and offering for sale in the united states microstrategy business intelligence platform  when used with an appropriate database 
the consolidated complaint accuses microstrategy of willful infringement and seeks damages  a finding that the case is exceptional and an award of attorneys fees  and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief 
in its initial disclosures pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a served on december   dsc declined to disclose the amount of its alleged damages  but disclosed that its alleged damages are based on a reasonable royalty theory 
microstrategy answered the consolidated complaint on december   denied infringement  asserted affirmative defenses of non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability  among others  and counter claimed for declaratory judgment that the patent is not infringed  is invalid  and is unenforceable 
all of the involved parties are proposing a trial date of march  the outcome of this litigation is not presently determinable 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition in addition to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been subject to other litigation 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that it is probable  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the related cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management s attention and resources 
we could face liability claims relating to alarm 
com products and services and these claims could result in significant costs and liabilities our alarm 
com subsidiary provides web enabled security and activity monitoring technology 
we face exposure to liability claims in the event that any alarm 
com product or service results in personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain insurance policies to provide certain coverage for general liability claims  such insurance may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us and such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
in addition  in the event that any alarm 
com product or service is proved to be defective  we may be required to recall or redesign such products or services  which could result in significant unexpected costs 
any liability claim or product recall could result in harm to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
government regulations or other standards could have an adverse effect on the operations of our alarm 
com business the operations of our alarm 
com subsidiary may become subject to certain federal  state  and local regulations and licensing requirements 
many jurisdictions have licensing laws directed specifically toward the home alarm and monitoring industry 
we believe that the products and services provided by our alarm 
com subsidiary do not require certain licenses or permits required of traditional providers of home protection and monitoring services 
if laws  regulations or licensing requirements in the jurisdictions in which alarm 
com operates were to change or if existing laws  regulations and licensing requirements were to be construed to require alarm 
com to obtain licenses or permits to provide its products and services  we may be required to modify our operations or to utilize resources to maintain compliance with such rules and regulations  or we may become subject to adverse regulatory action  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business and operating results of our alarm 
com business 
our alarm 
com subsidiary relies on third party manufacturers to produce and assemble its products 
if these manufacturers experience an interruption in their operations or are otherwise unable to successfully deliver the products to meet our production demands  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have outsourced the production and assembly of our alarm 
com products to third party manufacturers 
any interruption in the operations of our manufacturers could materially adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled deliveries to customers and business partners 
in addition  these manufacturing facilities may not be able to increase production on a timely basis  or on terms acceptable to us  to keep up with the requirements of the alarm 
com business 
as a result  we may not be able to satisfy customer orders or contractual commitments  leading to the termination of one or more of our contracts or resulting in litigation against us  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial results 
alternative manufacturers may be difficult to find on terms acceptable to us or in a timely manner 
because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing holders of class b common stock  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without the approval of our board of directors or our other stockholders  prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy  or limit your ability to influence corporate matters we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of our class a common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class b common stock  except that holders of class a common stock have one vote per share while holders of class b common stock have ten votes per share 
as of february   holders of our class b common stock owned  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  beneficially owned  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power  as of february  accordingly  mr 
saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and by laws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  all of whom are current employees or directors of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without the approval of our board of directors or our other stockholders  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
in addition  this concentrated control limits stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and  as a result  we may take actions that our non controlling stockholders do not view as beneficial 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none

the term of the lease expires in but may be extended at our option for two additional five year terms 
in addition  we lease approximately  square feet of sales  research and development and administrative offices domestically and approximately  square feet of sales  research and development and administrative offices internationally in a variety of locations

organizations recently have sought  and we expect will continue to seek  to standardize their various business intelligence applications around a single software platform 
this trend presents both opportunities and risks for our business 
it offers us the opportunity to increase the size of transactions with new customers and to expand the size of our business intelligence installations with existing customers 
on the other hand  it presents the risk that we may not be able to penetrate accounts where a competitor currently is or may become the incumbent business intelligence application provider 
in addition  companies with industry leading positions in certain software markets  such as microsoft  oracle  ibm and sap ag  have begun incorporating business intelligence capabilities into their product suites 
as a result  our products need to be sufficiently differentiated from these bundled software offerings to create customer demand for our platform and products 
to address these opportunities and challenges  we are implementing a number of initiatives  including concentrating our research and development efforts on maintaining our position as a technology leader by continuing to innovate and lead in enterprise business intelligence  improving the capability of our products to efficiently handle the ever increasing volume of data and user scalability needs of our current and future customers  and adding analytical and end user features to support the increasing levels of sophistication in our customers business intelligence needs and applications  such as the incorporation of dynamic enterprise dashboards to our interfaces  and enhancing our global sales and services organizations  which we have grown substantially over the last two years 
during  we slowed the pace of headcount growth in these organizations to focus on integrating and leveraging the additional sales and services capacity we now have in place 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  such as office leases and certain personnel costs  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough in any particular period to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall in that period 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in our operating results 
we therefore believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of net deferred tax assets  and litigation and contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to software development costs  intangible assets  provision for income taxes  and other contingent liabilities  including liabilities that we deem not probable of assertion 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
microstrategy does not have any material ownership interest in any special purpose or other entities that are not wholly owned and or consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  microstrategy does not have any material related party transactions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 related party disclosures 
revenue recognition 
microstrategy s software revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of software  we follow the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we also follow the guidance provided by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition where applicable 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses to end users or resellers upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement  as provided by agreements  contracts  purchase orders or other arrangements  generally executed by both parties other than certain customer specific instances in which we have a customary and historical business practice of accepting orders without signed agreements  delivery of the software  and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable fee is reasonably assured 
when the fees for software upgrades and enhancements  technical support  consulting and education are bundled with the license fee  they are unbundled for revenue recognition purposes using vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value vsoe of the elements 
product support or post contract support pcs revenue is derived from providing technical software support and software updates and upgrades to customers 
pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which in most cases is one year 
our vsoe for pcs  which includes updates  upgrades  and enhancements  is determined based upon the optional stated renewal fee for pcs in the contract  which is the price the customer is required to pay when pcs is renewed 
additionally  the optional stated renewal fee used to establish vsoe for pcs in a software transaction must be above our minimum substantive vsoe rate for pcs 
if a stated renewal rate is considered non substantive  vsoe of pcs has not been established and we recognize all revenue under the arrangement ratably over the pcs period 
a minimum substantive vsoe rate is determined based upon an analysis of historical sales of pcs 
for a renewal rate to be non substantive  we believe it must be significantly lower than our minimum vsoe rate 
revenue from consulting  education and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
our vsoe for services other than pcs is determined based upon an analysis of our historical sales of each element when sold separately from software 
we sell various levels of consulting services such as associate  consultant  senior consultant  manager  and senior manager 
in accordance with sop  for new offerings of services other than pcs or service offerings that have not had a sufficient history of sales activity  we initially establish vsoe based on the list price as determined by management with the relevant authority 
each service offering has a single list price in each country where sold 
if vsoe exists for all undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the elements where evidence of fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of an arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop when a software license arrangement requires us to provide significant production  customization or modification of the software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product licenses revenue and consulting services revenue are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under percentage of completion accounting  both product licenses and consulting services revenue are recognized as work progresses based upon labor hours incurred 
any expected losses on contracts in progress are expensed in the period in which the losses become probable and reasonably estimable 
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method were not material for the years ended december   and if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or the acceptance period lapses  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver specified future products or upgrades  revenue is recognized when the specified future product or upgrades are delivered or when the obligation to deliver specified future products expires  whichever occurs earlier 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
license revenue derived from sales to resellers or oems who purchase our products for resale is recognized upon sufficient evidence that the products have been sold to the ultimate end users provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our standard software license and reseller agreements do not include any return rights other than the right to return non conforming products for repair or replacement under our standard product warranties  which we account for in accordance with sfas no 
during the last three fiscal years  we have not experienced any product returns related to warranty claims 
our standard software license agreements do not include any price protection or similar rights 
with respect to software arrangements with resellers  our business practice is to require end user sell through evidence or representation at the time a reseller order is placed 
we offer price protection to certain government agencies as required by applicable laws and regulations 
for example  transactions under our general services administration federal supply schedule contract must comply with the price reductions clause 
in addition  certain government agencies have the right to cancel contracts for convenience 
during the last three fiscal years  contracts cancelled for convenience were not significant 
during the last three fiscal years  we have not paid any significant amounts with regards to a return  price protection or similar rights clause 
therefore no allowance for returns  price protection or similar rights has been recorded in our financial statements for the last three fiscal years 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are included in deferred revenue and advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the application of sop  as amended  requires judgment  including a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed and determinable  whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its liquidity or financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
each quarter  we adjust this allowance based upon management s review and assessment of each category of receivable 
while actual credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
litigation and contingencies 
we are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are involved in a lawsuit with diagnostic systems corp 
relating to claims involving patent infringement 
the outcome of this litigation is not presently determinable  and as such  we are currently unable to estimate the potential range of gain or loss  if any  relating to this action 
accordingly  no provision for this matter has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additional information regarding this matter is included under item legal proceedings 
we have contingent liabilities that  in management s judgment  are not probable of assertion

income taxes 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  changes in applicable tax laws  transfer pricing methods  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
however  judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections  which could impact the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in future periods 
as a global company with subsidiaries in many countries  we are required to calculate and provide for estimated income tax liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax liabilities and exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the future recoverability of deferred tax assets 
changes in the estimated level of annual pre tax income  changes in tax laws related to the utilization of net operating losses in various jurisdictions  changes in tax rates  and changes resulting from tax audits can all affect the overall effective income tax rate which  in turn  impacts the overall level of income tax expense and net income 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past and future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would reduce income in the period that such determination was made 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it provides that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken 
income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of adoption  we recorded a tax liability of million and a reduction in retained earnings of the same amount 
during  we recorded an additional million net liability and a corresponding increase in current income tax expense 
we include interest expense and penalties if any related to uncertain tax positions as additional tax expense

if there had been no change to foreign currency exchange rates from to  sales and marketing expenses for would have been million rather than million 
the change in the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during and  as compared to the prior year  is primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar as compared to the euro and the other principal currencies in which the company s foreign subsidiaries conduct business
