item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to a number of factors including risks discussed in item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of digital video systems and services including the management  aggregation  licensing  storage  and distribution of video  television  gaming and advertisement content to cable system operators  telecommunications companies and broadcast television companies 
we have three reportable segments broadband  broadcast and services 
the broadband segment includes hardware  software and systems  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our hardware  software and systems product revenues are comprised of sales originating from our broadband and broadcast segments 
the services segment is comprised of revenue related to professional services  media content services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support for the above products 
we have experienced fluctuations in our product revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material and labor to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the product before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs and consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
in the current state of the economy  we expect that our broadband and broadcast customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter  and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
in light of the higher proportion of our international business due  in part  to our acquisitions of the european based businesses of liberate technologies and the on demand group  ltd odg in fiscal  we expect movements in foreign currency exchange rates to continue to impact our operating results and the equity section of our balance sheet 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials and labor to manufacture our products  and our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter 
in september  seachange purchased the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of odg 
as a result of this acquisition  seachange owned of odg and a equity investment in filmflex movies limited filmflex  a company based in the united kingdom 
the purchase agreement provided for additional contingent consideration to the former shareholders of odg  if odg met certain financial goals 
the contingent consideration was paid or issued in four installments 
in may  seachange paid million in cash to satisfy the first installment 
on june   seachange and the former shareholders of odg amended the original purchase agreement to provide for the acceleration of the second installment of contingent consideration in exchange for the issuance of  shares of seachange s common stock having a fair market value of million as of the date of the amendment 
in december seachange and the former shareholders of odg amended the original purchase agreement to provide the former shareholders of odg  shares of seachange s common stock in march having a fair market value of million as of the date of the amendment in satisfaction of the third installment 
on march   seachange and the former stockholders of odg amended the original purchase agreement to provide for the satisfaction of the final contingent by consideration through the issuance of  shares of seachange s common stock having a fair market value of million as of the date of the amendment 
as of january  the company recorded the third and fourth contingent consideration installments totaling million  as additional goodwill for the step up acquisition of odg 
seachange held a equity investment in filmflex which was founded in by odg  columbia pictures corporation limited sony and walt disney company limited disney to provide an exclusive video on demand movie service for virgin media 
each of the investors owned of filmflex 
on december   seachange sold all of the shares held by odg in filmflex to the two other existing shareholders of filmflex sony and disney and to filmflex 
the aggregate consideration received by odg in connection with this sale was million in cash resulting in a gain of approximately million 
this gain was million lower than the million gain previously disclosed in the company s march  earnings press release that announced its unaudited fiscal fourth quarter and year end financial results due to the reduction of goodwill associated with filmflex 
concurrent with the filmflex divestiture  odg executed a two year outsourcing services agreement in which odg will continue to provide filmflex with selected planning  production and operations support services 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
principles of consolidation 
the company consolidates the financial statements of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all inter company accounts are properly eliminated in consolidation 
seachange also holds minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance 
the company evaluates its equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines of fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  as revised under fin r should be applied in the financial statements 
fin r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
the company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest entities as of january  the company s investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
the investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common shares of the affiliate  seachange s proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
revenues from sales of hardware  software and systems that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management and at least one year of product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
revenue from these activities are deferred at the time of the product sale and recognized ratably over the period these services are performed 
revenue from ongoing product maintenance and technical support agreements are recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
revenue from software development contracts that include significant modification or customization  including software product enhancements  is recognized based on the percentage of completion contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates of total labor efforts to complete the contract 
for contracts  where some level of profit is assured but the company is only able to estimate ranges of amounts of total contract revenue and total contract cost  the company uses the lowest probable level of profits in accounting for the contract revenues and costs 
accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in contract accounting when executed 
revenue from shipping and handling costs and other out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues 
our share of inter company profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies are eliminated in consolidation in proportion to our equity ownership 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware  software  systems and services in multiple element arrangements 
revenues under multiple element arrangements are recorded based on the residual method of accounting 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
the amounts allocated to undelivered elements  which may include project management  training  installation  maintenance and technical support and hardware and software components  are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation  training and project management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
these services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software development with significant modification or customization and systems sales where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement other than maintenance and technical support  percentage of completion accounting is applied for revenue recognition purposes to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support 
where fair value of undelivered service elements has not been established  the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services are performed 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  seachange accounts for the value of this consideration as an adjustment to revenue 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the fair value for each element 
we recognize revenue for product and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral 
for some international customers  the company may require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
the company monitors payments from customers and assesses any collection issues 
the company maintains allowances for specific doubtful accounts and other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments and records these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
the company bases its allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any taxes assessed by a governmental authority related to revenue producing transactions eg sales or value added taxes are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues 
inventories reserves 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components and subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of seachange s hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
the costs and net realizable value of inventories are reviewed quarterly 
seachange records charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value when impairment is identified through the quarterly review process 
for inventory that has been written down to its net realizable value  the reserve is released upon sale or disposal of this inventory 
our manufacturing  finance and operations personnel monitor quarterly the inventories to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value when impairment is identified through the quarterly management review process 
obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components  subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
for the years ended january    and  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million  and million 
investments in affiliates 
investments in affiliates include equity investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method of accounting 
for investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the affiliate  the investments are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common stock of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate is recorded as equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether an investment is more accurately reflected using the cost or equity method 
we periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  may suggest a non temporary decline in the value of the investment 
the carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have completed business acquisitions that resulted in goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our accounting for acquisitions involves judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the estimates of fair values of certain acquired intangible assets which may involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  of acquired tangible acquired assets  of assumed liabilities and contingencies  and the estimated useful lives of acquired long lived assets  and the accounting for income taxes in purchase accounting 
the values we record for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values primarily calculated by using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
such valuations depend upon significant estimates and assumptions that are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
these estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired products or services  and discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets  as discussed below  may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
changes in assumptions and estimates related to acquisitions could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets 
other long lived assets include million of property and equipment  million of intangible assets and goodwill of million as of january  the intangible assets have been subject to amortization since acquisition 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and periodically review both goodwill and intangibles for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  which may suggest an asset is not recoverable that is  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
factors we consider important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and a reduction in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
our cash flow projections contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
we believe there is no impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets as of january  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that purchased capitalized software licenses that were classified as other assets on the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets were impaired as of july   resulting in a reduction to other assets of million and a corresponding increase to cost of revenues on the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  the company concluded that three separate capitalized software licenses that were purchased for eventual use in current and future products of the company were impaired during the company s fiscal second quarter based on its determination that triggering events had occurred during this period that warranted consideration of an impairment of long lived assets 
during this period  two product line general managers were terminated  both of whom had direct responsibility for incorporating the capitalized software licenses into new or existing products 
the replacements for the terminated general managers  with company management concurrence  abandoned plans to use the capitalized software licenses in any new or existing company products during the fiscal year ended january  with no identified future cash flows to substantiate further capitalization of these software licenses  the company determined these assets to be impaired during the fiscal year ended january  share based compensation 
prior to february   we accounted for all of employee and non employee director stock based compensation awards using the intrinsic value method under apb  and provided the required disclosures in accordance with sfas effective february   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with that transition method  we have not restated prior periods for the effect of compensation expense calculated under sfas r 
we have continued to use the black scholes pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
on january   the company accelerated the vesting of certain unvested stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share that were previously awarded to its employees  including its executive officers and non employee directors  under the company s equity compensation plans 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that would otherwise be recognized after the adoption of sfas r on february  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company has maintained a full valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets primarily due to the significant historical pre tax losses and the significant ongoing uncertainties surrounding the ability of the us entity  seachange international  inc  to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
in addition  seachange maintains a valuation allowance for the full amount of certain foreign tax assets 
at january   the valuation allowance was million 
income tax contingencies 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as it relates to income tax liabilities and lowers the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements from probable to more likely than not ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent 
under fin  the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin was adopted by the company on february  see note 
accounting for contingencies 
we are subject to certain claims and litigation  including proceedings under government laws and regulations and commercial disputes relating to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
we review and determine which liabilities  if any arising from these claims and litigations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  loss contingency liabilities are recorded for these contingencies based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside counsel when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
foreign currency translation 
we have determined that the functional currency of all but one of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
where the us dollar is designated as the functional currency of an entity  we translate that entity s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies into us dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates  as of each balance sheet date 
nonmonetary assets eg  inventories  property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement accounts eg  cost of sales  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between the functional currency the us dollar and the local currency 
revenue and other expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the fiscal period 
translation adjustments and transactions gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and any unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in income 
for the single foreign subsidiary where the local currency is designated as the functional currency  we translate its assets and liabilities into us dollars the reporting currency at current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date 
revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in income 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  the following table sets forth summarized consolidated financial information for each of the two fiscal years ended january  and year ended january  in thousands broadband revenues video on demand revenues advertising revenues total broadband revenues broadcast revenues total product revenues total service revenue total revenue product cost of revenues services cost of revenues total cost of revenues product gross profit services gross profit total gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net impairment on investment in affiliate gain on sale of investment in affiliate income loss before income taxes and equity income in earnings of affiliates income tax provision benefit equity income in earnings of affiliates  net of tax net income loss for the fiscal year ended january   our total revenues increased to million from the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   two customers each accounted for more than and collectively accounted for of our total revenues and these same two customers each accounted for more than and collectively accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended january  revenues from these customers were primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international products and services revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
customers in the us and united kingdom each accounted for more than and collectively accounted for and of total revenue in the fiscal year ended january  and  respectively 
revenues from european customers amounted to million and million in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
we expect that international products and services revenues will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
since substantially all our product sales are made in united states dollars usd  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
odg has designated the great britain pound gbp as its functional currency  with their service sales  primarily payable in gbp  providing a natural hedge for payments in local currency 
thus  we do not expect to experience  nor have we experienced any material impact on our results from fluctuations in foreign currency transactions from odg operations 
however  since the odg operation is translated to usd for reporting purposes  translation gains and losses  as a result of foreign currency rate fluctuations  are recorded in the equity section of our balance sheet 
we continue to expect exposure in fluctuations in the usd gbp exchange rate in the equity section of our balance sheet in the future 
product revenues 
our product revenues consist of sales of hardware  software and systems from our broadband and broadcast segments 
our total product revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of product revenues in the fiscal year ended january  and of product revenues in the fiscal year ended january   increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal advertising product revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the year over year increase in advertising product revenues was driven primarily by the increased high definition advertising insertion requirements for north american based cable  telephone and satellite customers 
video on demand product revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in video on demand product revenues was derived primarily from increased software development revenue in connection with the vod purchase agreement with comcast and increased software development revenue derived from the middleware contract with virgin media offset by lower vod software license revenue 
our broadcast product revenues increased by to million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the year over year increase in revenues related primarily to significant orders from u 
s  and european customers 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support  software development  and movie content services 
our services revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the growth of services revenue is due to an increase of odg s media content services of million or year over year primarily from increased content processing revenue from virgin media along with increased professional services revenue from new customers in europe and latin america 
in addition  million is attributable to an increase in vod maintenance revenue related to increased system deployments compared to the previous year 
product gross profit 
costs of product revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead costs relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems  and related expenses and labor and overhead costs related to software development contracts 
costs of product revenues increased to million compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  resulting in product gross profit of of related revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal the increase in product gross profit percentages between years is due mainly to a significant increase in broadcast product gross profit percentage due to increased revenue and a favorable customer mix partially offset by significant expenses incurred in the second quarter of fiscal related to impaired assets and headcount reductions 
services gross profit 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support  software development  project management and costs associated with providing media services 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in service gross profit percentage to from was primarily due to headcount related costs to service our increased installed base of systems  our anticipation of increased revenue outside the u 
s and additional costs at odg as it expanded its operations beyond the uk research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  the increase is primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of million which includes employee severance expenses of  related to headcount reductions occurring in the second quarter of fiscal year ended january   higher performance based compensation  and lower absorption of engineering expenses for customer software development 
the increase was offset by decreases in research and development materials cost of  a decrease in sabbatical expense of  and contract labor of  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the fiscal year ended january  as we continue our development of our new products and enhancements 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues are relatively flat year over year 
this increase in total expenses is primarily due to  in increased salaries and benefits attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees  increased commissions of approximately million due to higher revenues offset by lower distributor commissions of  and lower tradeshow expenses of  we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue to expand our product offerings and increase our selling presence in overseas markets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues are relatively flat year over year 
general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to increased headcount related expenses of million and million of performance based compensation offset by lower general and administrative expenses at odg 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense consists of the amortization of acquired intangible assets which are operating expenses and not considered costs of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  amortization is based on the future economic value of the related intangible assets which is generally higher in earlier years of the assets lives 
the sale of the company s equity investment in filmflex and the related intangible assets also contributed to the decrease in amortization expense from the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  the table below classifies the amortization expense by its source category  sales and marketing or general and administrative expense 
for the year ended january  for the year ended january  in thousands sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense amortization expense an additional  and  of amortization expense related to acquired technology was charged to cost of sales for the years ended january  and  respectively 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in interest income in comparison to the year ended january  is primarily due to higher prevailing interest rates on our marketable securities invested and the increase of our cash and marketable securities as a result of the sale of the company s equity investment in filmflex during the year ended january  interest expense was  for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended january  impairment on investment in affiliate

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from sales of our common stock and cash flows generated from operations 
during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at january  to million at january   largely due to cash provided by certain operating and financing activities and the sale of filmflex

significant changes in operating assets and liabilities that provided cash an increase in deferred revenues of million 
the significant changes in assets and liabilities that used cash from operations included an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to inventory acquired and subsequently reclassified to fixed assets for use as research and development equipment 
the share based compensation of million in fiscal increased from  in fiscal and million in fiscal due to the adoption of sfas r beginning february  it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience significant increases or decreases in our inventories as a result of the timing of the procurement of components for anticipated orders for both our product segments and increases or decreases in our accounts receivable balances and customer deposits as a result of the timing of receiving customer orders during the period and of customer payments

eitf requires companies to accrue the cost of such compensated absences over the requisite service period 
the task force allows the use of one of two specified methodologies for adopting the change in accounting principle i a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the year of adoption  or ii retrospective application to all prior periods 
the company elected to use the cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings resulting in an additional liability of  and a corresponding increase in the accumulated deficit of  the impact of this adoption and related restatement in form q a filed on october  for the quarter ended april  does not include any net tax effects as the company s deferred tax assets are fully reserved against due to the uncertainties related to the company s ability to generate sufficient pre tax income in future years see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under this transition method  periods prior to february  have not been restated 
accrued expenses and other long term liabilities for the first three quarters of fiscal include vested and unvested accrued sabbatical expense for all employees who are eligible for sabbatical leave

employees eligible for sabbatical leave prior to november  grandfathered are required to use the balance of their available time by july  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has prospectively applied the changes of its sabbatical leave benefit for those employees that have unvested sabbatical balances accumulating under eitf this prospective change resulted in a  reduction in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities and a corresponding decrease to related operating expenses and cost of revenues 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue producing transactions eg sales  use  value added and excise taxes between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not change our policy of presenting taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as it relates to income tax liabilities and lowers the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements from probable to more likely than not ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent 
under fin  the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin was adopted by the company on february  see note 
on january   the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and an amendment to sab no 
which provided expressed views on the use of a simplified method  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
per sab no 
 the company elected to use the simplified method until it could develop more detailed information about employee exercise behavior 
the staff stated in sab no 
that it would not expect a company to use the simplified method for share option grants after december  the release of sab no 
outlines examples of situations in which the staff believes that it may be appropriate to continue the use of the simplified method beyond december  the company has determined that seachange meets one of the three examples outlined in sab no 
under the provision that the company has significantly changed the types of employees that receive share option grants 
as a result  the company does not have enough historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected returns and will continue with the simplified method until it has enough historical information to refine the expected term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has historically been associated with product sales arrangements denominated in the local currency where the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the us dollar as most of our revenues are in us dollars and operating expenses in europe and asia 
since substantially all our product sales are made in united states dollars usd  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
odg has designated the great britain pound gbp as its functional currency  with their service sales  primarily payable in gbp  providing a natural hedge for payments in local currency 
thus  we do not expect to experience  nor have we experienced any material impact on our results from fluctuations in foreign currency transactions from odg operations 
however  since the odg operation is translated to usd for reporting purposes  translation gains and losses  as a result of foreign currency rate fluctuations  are recorded in the equity section of our balance sheet 
we continue to expect exposure in fluctuations in the usd gbp exchange rate in the equity section of our balance sheet in the future 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  our long term marketable investments  have fixed interest rates  and therefore are not subject to any interest rate exposure
