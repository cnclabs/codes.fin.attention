item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the corporation and the bank 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item of this form k 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and this form k contain certain forward looking statements which are based on assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the corporation 
management desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing the corporation of the protections of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements in this form k 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar words 
the corporation s ability to predict results of the actual effect of future plans or strategies is uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s operations include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  increase in the housing supply in our market area  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the corporation s market areas and accounting principles and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and you should not rely too much on these statements 
general the corporation s results of operations depend primarily on revenue generated as a result of its net interest income and non interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the corporation earns on its interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and investment securities and the interest the corporation pays on its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of customer savings and money market accounts  time deposits and borrowings 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit and loan accounts  gains on the sale of loans and investments  and loan servicing fees 
the corporation s results of operations are also affected by the provisions for loan losses and other expenses 
other expenses consist primarily of noninterest expense  including compensation and benefits  occupancy  equipment  data processing  marketing  automated teller machine costs and  when applicable  deposit insurance premiums 
the corporation s results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities  as well as other factors identified under the caption forward looking statements above 
business strategy the bank s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank  dedicated to commercial lending  home mortgage lending  consumer lending  small business lending and providing quality financial services to local personal and business customers 
the bank has sought to implement this strategy by i focusing on commercial banking opportunities  ii continued efforts towards the origination of residential mortgage loans  including one to four family residential construction and land development loans  iii providing high quality  personalized financial services to individuals and business customers and communities served by its branch network  iv selling many of its fixed rate mortgages to the secondary market  v focusing on asset quality  vi containing operating expenses  and vii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements combined with prudent growth 
operating strategy the corporation serves as a holding company for the bank and other subsidiaries whereby it provides strategic oversight  management  access to capital and other resources and activities typically performed by bank holding companies 
the operating strategy of the corporation has been to expand and diversify its consolidated operations across a variety of companies and or operating units that are engaged in complementary  but different  businesses and or operating strategies 
this diversification strategy is expected to continue as opportunities arise  although there are no specific acquisitions or new business formations planned at this time 
the bank currently has two offices in pierce county south of king county  with the remaining offices all located north of king county 
management has further indicated that the market areas just outside king county including  but not necessarily limited to snohomish  pierce  kitsap and thurston counties are logical areas for potential future expansion  as these markets have characteristics most similar to those in which the bank has experienced previous success 
the primary business of the bank is to acquire funds in the form of deposits and wholesale funds  and to use the funds to make commercial  consumer  and real estate loans in its primary market area 
in addition  and to a lesser extent  the bank invests in a variety of investment grade securities including  but not necessarily limited to us government and federal agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt  equity securities  and municipal securities 
the bank intends to continue to fund its assets primarily with retail and commercial deposits  although  fhlb advances  brokered deposits  and other wholesale borrowings  will also likely be used as a supplemental source of funds 
the corporation s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on the bank s loan and investment portfolio and the bank s cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the bank reviews its opportunities with respect to both assets and liabilities 
in the past two fiscal years  for example  the bank chose to concentrate its commercial lending efforts on growing its prime based loan portfolio  at a time when many lenders were offering fixed rate real estate loans at sub prime rates 
in this regard  the bank s loan portfolio growth is heavily concentrated in the active real estate development and construction markets in the puget sound region 
through its relationships with established real estate developers and builders  the bank s experienced loan officers were successful at growing this portion of the bank s portfolio  which is primarily prime based business 
this was beneficial in previous years  with the fomc s federal reserve s open market committee efforts to increase short terms interest rates  which have in turn increased the prime lending rate 
with the fomc s basis point reduction on september   basis point reduction on october   basis point reduction on december   basis point reduction in january and basis point reduction in march  the corporation is experiencing a decline in its net interest margin 
this rapid pace of easing monetary policy by the fomc will contribute to further declines in the corporation s net interest margin 
the results of this strategy are discussed in more detail in the section entitled comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march  net interest income 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  these changing rates also impact the bank s earnings 
management acknowledges that there is a lag effect in this regard  in both increasing and decreasing rate environments as the rates on the bank s certificate of deposit liabilities do not adjust instantly  rather the impact occurs more gradually as the certificates of deposit mature and reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
net interest income is also affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets equal or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the corporation s profitability is also affected by the level of the bank s other income and expenses 
other noninterest income includes income associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans  loan servicing fees  deposit account related fees  and net gains and losses on sales of interest earning assets 
this portion of the bank s income is heavily dependent on the bank s success at originating and selling one to four family mortgage loans into the secondary market 
in addition  the bank s ability to generate fee income on its deposit accounts impacts this portion of the bank s income stream 
in fiscal  the bank introduced an overdraft protection service  which increased the deposit related fee income and is discussed in more detail in the section entitled comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march  other noninterest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses and other operating costs 
in fiscal  the bank began a bank wide efficiency initiative  soliciting input from all employees and implementing many of the suggestions it received 
this is an ongoing process  as management continues to look for ways to improve efficiency 
to encourage employees to participate in this initiative  the bank includes a profitability component to the incentive portion of the employee s pay  and efficiency accounts for one third of this profitability component 
also during fiscal  the bank formed a core data processor task team  to analyze ways to best utilize its new data processing system 
at the time of conversion in november  the focus was appropriately placed on converting the data from the previous system 
subsequently  the focus shifted to ensuring that the bank was taking advantage of the benefits offered by the new system  and this is a process that will continue in future years along with the efficiency initiative discussed above 
finally  the corporation s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation  regulation  and monetary and fiscal policies 
critical accounting estimates management recognizes that loan losses occur over the life of a loan  and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based on a number of factors  including the level of non performing loans  loan loss experience  credit concentrations  reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio  collateral values  historical industry loss experience  and uncertainties in economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period operating results and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because i it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future losses on loans  and ii the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
the corporation has an active ongoing credit review function 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated  probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  historical industry loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time financial statements are prepared  but the ultimate recovery of loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the bank s control  which may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided for in the financial statements 
management believes the bank maintains an allowance for credit losses sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank has established a systematic methodology to assist management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  and continues to work on enhancing its methodologies in this regard 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  each individual loan  previously classified by management  or newly classified during the quarterly review  is evaluated for loss potential  and a specific amount or percentage deemed to be at risk is added to the overall required reserve amount 
for the remaining portion of the portfolio the bank applies sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
reserve factors are applied to homogeneous loan pools which are consistent with the bank s experience in that loan pool type or with industry guidelines if management believes such guidelines are more appropriate 
the applied percentage is also influenced by other economic factors in the bank s market area  the state s economy  and national economic factors that could influence the quality of the loan portfolio in general 
the calculated amount is compared to the actual amount recorded in the allowance at the end of each quarter and a determination is made as to whether the allowance is adequate 
management increases the amount of the allowance for loan losses by charges to income and decreases the amount by loans charged off net of recoveries 
the corporation s senior management reviews and analyzes the loan portfolio  charge offs  and allowance on a quarterly basis 
management then discusses the development and calculation of this critical accounting estimate with the executive committee of the board of directors 
horizon s audit committee also reviews the corporation s disclosures including this critical accounting estimate 
management reviewed and evaluated the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance at march  and believes that the allowance at of net loans  or million is adequate for the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and the current economic environment 
the allowance was of net loans or million at march  in fiscal  the loan portfolio grew to billion at march  from billion at march  the loan portfolio has experienced substantial growth especially in construction and land development loans 
at march   construction and land development loans totaled million  an increase of million or from million at march  the increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to the substantial growth in this higher risk portion of the loan portfolio 
the bank s allowance for loan and lease losses alll analysis also considered the potential impacts of sub prime loans originated by others in the bank s markets in recent years 
these loans are cited as contributing to the slowdowns in the housing markets across the country 
as homeowner s face significant increases in their housing payments when these sub prime loans reset  this will have potential adverse affects on the economy with an increasing supply of housing units on the market 
it is predicted that these adverse impacts will result in increased numbers of houses listed for sale for those facing unaffordable increases in their monthly housing payments  a decline in prices and it will also likely increase the number of foreclosures on residential units 
economic data from the federal reserve showed a slowdown in overall economic activity in recent quarters 
economic conditions in the region remain do remain stronger than reported national trends  however we continue to see increasing signs of a slowing housing market  including increasing inventories and overall slower sales activity 
we are seeing a slowdown in our land acquisition and development progress and are closely watching a number of relationships 
the bank s loan portfolio showed increasing signs of strain at march  during the fiscal year ended march   it was necessary to recognize  in writeoffs relating primarily to two of the bank s builder developer relationships 
in addition  the loans relating to these writeoffs were placed on non accrual status  bringing our total non accruing loans to million at march  compared to  at march  this brings the bank s total non performing assets total assets ratio to at march  compared to at march  in addition  the bank s delinquency levels loans to days past due totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the factors discussed above led management to increase the allowance to its current levels 
the bank recorded net charge offs of  and  during the years ended march  and the provision for loan losses has fluctuated depending on the growth and mix of the loan portfolio and the level of charge offs 
the provision for loan losses was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the corporation s significant accounting principles are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment than do our other significant accounting policies detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation reviews historical origination and charge off relationships  charge off experience factors  collection data  delinquency reports  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions and trends and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the appropriateness of the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses 
loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the corporation repossesses and disposes of the collateral or the account is otherwise deemed uncollectible 
the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate yet not excessive to cover probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates 
investments 
the corporation classifies its investments as either available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair value  which is determined by obtaining quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income and excluded from earnings 
realized gains and losses and declines in fair value determined to be other than temporary are included in earnings 
the fair value of investments is discussed in more detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
long lived assets and intangibles 
the corporation periodically assesses the impairment of its long lived assets and intangibles using judgment as to the effects of external factors  including market conditions 
if actual external conditions and future operating results differ from the corporation s judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the appropriate market value 
accrued taxes 
the corporation estimates tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the corporation s tax position 
comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total consolidated assets for the corporation as of march   were billion  a increase from the march  level of billion 
this increase in assets was primarily attributable to the growth in loans receivable to billion at march  from billion at march  the growth in loans receivable was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in construction and land development loans since march  the bank continued its focus on expanding its relationships with established residential real estate developers and one to four family residential builders  which resulted in the continued growth in this component of loans receivable during the period 
also contributing to this increase is a slowing pace of loan paydowns in this category  as the sales activity has slowed compared to previous periods 
this has resulted in loan balances remaining on the corporation s balance sheet longer than in more active periods for real estate sales 
also increasing during the period was the commercial loan category  as the bank continues to focus on increasing its commercial lines of credit balances to diversify its loan portfolio and expand its relationships with businesses in its markets 
commercial real estate loans  primarily consisting of loans with initial fixed rate periods of three to five years  moderated during the period as the bank continued its trend away from the lower returns available in this segment in favor of the returns available in the construction and land development category 
one to four family mortgage loans  net increased to million at march  from million at march  a portion of the growth  approximately million  is related to loans secured by one to four family homes where builders were allowed to convert unsold speculative construction inventory into rental homes to assist with cash flow needs 
the bank continues its practice of selling most of its single family long term fixed rate loan production into the secondary market 
the bank sold million of real estate loans during fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the following is an analysis of the loan portfolio by major type of loan at march  and at march dollars in thousands first mortgage loans one to four family   one to four family construction   less participations sold   subtotal   commercial land development   commercial construction   multi family residential   nonresidential commercial real estate   commercial loans   home equity secured   other consumer loans   subtotal   total loans receivable   table continued on following page at march  less allowance for loan losses   total loans receivable  net   net residential loans   net commercial loans   net commercial real estate loans   net consumer loans   includes construction and development  multi family and commercial real estate loans 
includes home equity and other consumer loans 
as reflected in the table above  approximately of our total loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate and construction and land development loans 
these types of lending afford the bank an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one to four family residential lending 
these loans  however  also typically are greater in amount  more difficult to evaluate and monitor and  therefore  involve a greater degree of risk than single family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks by limiting the maximum loan to value ratio to between and and carefully reviewing the financial condition of the borrower  the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan 
construction and land development lending generally involves a higher degree of risk than permanent financing for a finished residence or commercial building  because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both the estimated cost of the project and the property s value at completion 
if the estimated cost of construction proves to be inaccurate  the bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to complete the project 
to address this risk  and because of the level of construction loans in the bank s portfolio  the bank has personnel dedicated specifically to monitoring the progress of its construction projects  and making on site inspections of the properties 
in addition  in an effort to monitor the available inventory in its markets  the bank also regularly reviews the overall building and development activity in its markets 
also  to mitigate the risks related to construction lending  the bank primarily deals with experienced builders  with acceptable credit histories  sound financial statements  and a proven track record in the industry 
in addition  the bank utilizes the services of experienced inspectors to monitor the progress and draw process in the more complex construction projects 
the bank also has an experienced appraisal staff  and members of senior management with related appraisal education and experience  who regularly review the appraisals utilized by the bank in analyzing prospective construction projects 
finally  members of the bank s senior management and loan committees also have a significant amount of experience in the areas of construction lending  appraisals  and loan underwriting  further mitigating the bank s risk in this area 
however  even with strong underwriting  changing economic conditions can have an adverse impact on the bank s borrowers and on the bank s loan portfolio 
see the asset quality section below for details on the bank s non performing assets and comments regarding identified potential weaknesses in its loan portfolio 
the bank actively originates construction loans through its mortgage loan division and its commercial loan division 
the bank s mortgage loan division generally oversees the single family custom construction loans  and to a lesser extent  speculative construction loans ie  loans for homes that do not have a contract with a buyer for the purchase of the home upon completion of the construction to smaller contractors building a limited number of speculative homes per year 
these construction loans are further broken down in the first two lines of the table below speculative construction one to four family and custom construction one to four family 
the bank s commercial lending division is responsible for the speculative construction projects for the bank s larger builders including large one to four family developments  in addition to the bank s multi family construction loans  non residential commercial construction loans  and the bank s land development loans

also contributing to the growth in liabilities during the fiscal year ended march  was the growth in the balance of deposits  which increased to billion at march  from million at march  the following is an analysis of the deposit portfolio by major type of deposit at march  and at march  in thousands demand deposits savings   checking   checking noninterest bearing   money market     time certificates of deposit less than    greater than or equal to

during the year ended march   the bank s subsidiary westward financial services  as a partner in the greenbriar nw llp gbnw  purchased an acre parcel of land in bellingham  washington for future residential development 
gbnw intends to develop the property in future years  into a neighborhood community to be known as fairhaven highlands 
the million shown on the corporation s balance sheet as an asset at march  represents the current level of the investment in real estate joint ventures  including the fairhaven highlands joint venture 
this amount also includes the remaining net investment in other residential development joint ventures 
the million shown in the liability section of the balance sheet represents the corresponding wholesale borrowing used to fund the investment in the fairhaven highlands joint venture  which includes costs that have been incurred and capitalized since the acquisition of the property 
at this time  the partnership is in the process of meeting with the appropriate public and private entities  in its preliminary planning efforts relating to the future development of the property  including an environmental impact statement which is currently in the process of being completed 
stockholders equity at march  increased to million from million at march  this increase was primarily attributable to net income of million for the year ended march  partially offset by the effects of million in dividends paid to stockholders and the corporation s share repurchase program 
the corporation repurchased shares totaling million during the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the corporation remains strong in terms of its capital position  with a stockholder equity to assets ratio of at march   compared to at march  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march  net interest income 
net interest income in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal total interest income increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest income on loans in fiscal was million  an increase from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily a result of the growth in loans receivable  as the bank experienced significant loan growth during the year  increasing the loan portfolio to billion at march   compared to billion at march  also included in interest income for the year ended march  and were approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred fee income recognition 
most of these fees were related to the bank s commercial loan portfolio for the years ended march  and  which resulted in large part from the success in increasing the real estate development loan portfolio 
these development loans typically are shorter term in nature  so the deferred fee recognition during the life of the loan is greater than what would be recognized for a comparable loan fee on a longer amortizing loan 
the table below presents an analysis of deferred fee recognition for the past two fiscal years year ended march  in thousands commercial loan deferred fees   one to four real estate mortgage loan deferred fees total   interest and dividends on investments and mortgage backed securities remained relatively unchanged at million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal total interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal interest on deposits increased significantly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as a result of increased growth in average deposits outstanding to million compared to million at march  also contributing to the increase was the higher level of interest rates paid during much of the year ended march  compared to the previous period 
at march   approximately of the bank s deposits were in the form of certificates of deposit  including million in brokered certificates of deposit 
while management continues its efforts to increase core deposits as a funding source  the competitive marketplace for core deposit dollars has resulted in limited success in this regard 
interest on borrowings increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of a higher level of average borrowings outstanding during the year ended march  of million compared to million during the year ended march  the bank continues to utilize wholesale borrowings in order to further leverage its balance sheet and better manage its interest rate risk profile 
provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
the ultimate recovery of loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the corporation s control  which may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided for in the financial statements 
the following table summarizes the allowance for loan losses  charge offs  and loan recoveries year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of period   provision for loan losses   charge offs  net of recoveries allowance at end of period   allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans receivable at the end of the period net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding during the period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming assets at the end of period  the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through the provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charges against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  these provisions reflect management s ongoing analysis of changes in loan portfolio composition by collateral categories  balances outstanding  overall credit quality of the portfolio  peer group analysis  historical industry loss experience  and current economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of net loans receivable at march  compared to million  or of net loans receivable at march  the increased allowance level resulted from continued loan portfolio growth in the higher risk lending categories of construction and land development  commercial real estate and commercial business loans during the period  which amounted to million  or of total loans receivable at march   versus million  or at march  non performing assets 
as of march   there were no loans in the loan portfolio over days delinquent and accruing and loans on nonaccrual status 
at march   total non performing loans were million 
non performing assets grew significantly in the final quarter of our fiscal year 
two lending relationships contributed to the majority of the increase in our non accrual figures  including a residential developer in snohomish county with inventory consisting of homes four of which are in escrow with sales pending  eight residential building lots and one commercial development project for a acre site in monroe  washington 
the bank had one property in the real estate owned category totaling  at march  total non performing assets represented million  or of total assets at march  compared to  or of total assets at march  the following table summarizes the corporation s non performing assets at march  dollars in thousands non performing assets accruing loans days past due non accrual loans  restructured loans total non performing loans  total non performing loans net loans real estate owned total non performing assets  total non performing assets total assets 
the majority of the corporation s loan portfolio consists of commercial loans and single family residential loans secured by real estate in the whatcom  skagit  snohomish  and pierce county areas of washington 
economic conditions in the region remain relatively healthy compared to national trends  however we are seeing increasing signs of a slowing housing market  including increasing inventories and overall slower sales activity 
construction and land development  commercial real estate and multi family real estate loans have larger individual loan amounts  which have a greater single impact on the total portfolio quality in the event of delinquency or default 
the bank is closely watching the construction and land development loan portfolio  and believe there is a potential for significant additions to non performing loans or real estate owned in the near future 
the corporation considers the allowance level to be appropriate  as a result of the changing portfolio mix and the current economic environment 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to significantly increase or decrease its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
noninterest income 
noninterest income in fiscal increased to million  from million in fiscal service fee income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the net gain on the sale of loans servicing released increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal mortgage loan originations were strong in fiscal  and the bank continued its practice of selling most of its single family long term fixed rate loan production into the secondary market 
there was a net gain on sales of investment securities of  in fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the gains in fiscal were primarily attributable to management s decision to sell selected equity securities from the bank s investment portfolio 
the losses in fiscal were a result of management s decisions to replace certain investment securities during the year in its efforts to improve future returns 
other noninterest income increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the primary reason for the increase from the prior period was additional income related to the purchase of approximately million of bank owned life insurance 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in fiscal increased to million  a increase from million in fiscal compensation and employee benefits increased slightly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal building occupancy expense was million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal increases in compensation and employee benefits and building and occupancy expenses resulted from the opening of a full service retail facility and mortgage loan center in puyallup  washington in june other noninterest expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of increased operating expenses related to the opening of the bank s puyallup retail office and loan center  consulting expenses  increased state of washington business occupation tax as a result of the growth in the loan portfolio of taxable commercial loans  as well as a valuation write down of the bank s other real estate owned of  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march  net interest income 
net interest income in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal total interest income increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest income on loans in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was as a result of a combination of factors  including the growth in loans receivable  as the bank experienced significant loan growth during the year  increasing to billion at march   compared to million at march   and an increasing prime lending rate throughout the fiscal year 
with a portfolio of prime based loans in excess of million throughout the year million at march  each quarter point increase in the prime lending rate equated to an annualized increase in interest income on those types of loans of over million 
the prime lending rate increased to in june  where it remained at march   compared to at march  also included in interest income for the year ended march  and were approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred fee income recognition 
in fiscal and  most of these fees were related to the bank s commercial loan portfolio  that resulted in large part from the success in increasing the real estate development loan portfolio 
these development loans typically are shorter term in nature  so the deferred fee recognition during the life of the loan is greater than what would be recognized for a comparable loan fee on a longer amortizing loan 
the table below presents an analysis of deferred fee recognition for the past two fiscal years year ended march  in thousands commercial loan deferred fees   one to four real estate mortgage loan deferred fees total   interest and dividends on investments and mortgage backed securities was million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal contributing to this increase was the restructuring of approximately million of the investment securities portfolio during the quarter ended march  the proceeds from those lower yielding securities were reinvested in highly rated  higher yielding investments 
also contributing to the change in fiscal was a reduction in dividend income on the bank s fhlb stock 
at march   horizon bank held million in fhlb of seattle stock and received dividends in the amounts of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the fhlb of seattle has been operating under a regulatory directive since may in december  the fhlb of seattle announced that quarterly cash dividends would resume with payment of a cash dividend in december on january   the fhlb of seattle declared a similar dividend per share  payable in february subsequently  on may   the fhlb announced a cash dividend of per share  payable may  the bank s stock ownership in the fhlb of seattle is expected to remain stable  increasing only if necessary to support its borrowing needs 
the fhlb of seattle also revised its requirements related to borrowings outstanding and stock levels required to support borrowings  and  therefore  the bank s existing level of fhlb stock will support a higher level of wholesale borrowings  decreasing the likelihood that the bank will need to purchase additional stock to support its borrowing activities 
total interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal interest on deposits increased significantly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal also contributing to the increase was the increasing level of interest rates during the year which resulted in an increase in interest expense  including interest paid on the bank s deposits 
at march   approximately of the bank s deposits were in the form of certificates of deposit  including million in brokered certificates of deposit 
as such  an increasing interest rate environment affects the bank s deposit interest expense more dramatically than if a larger portion of the bank s funding were in the form of lower cost checking and liquid savings accounts 
while management continues its efforts to decrease its reliance on certificates of deposit as a funding source  the competitive marketplace for core deposit dollars has resulted in only moderate success in this regard 
during fiscal  the bank s increase in deposit interest expense lagged the increase in its interest income on loans in dollar terms 
this was the result  in large part  to the immediate impact to interest income from the bank s prime based loan portfolio with each increase in the prime lending rate  and the lagged effect of increased interest expense on certificates of deposit  since these certificate of deposit rate increases do not occur instantaneously  instead lagging until the maturity of the certificate of deposit 
in addition  even if current market interest rates were not increasing  the bank s interest on deposits would continue to increase  since the current prevailing market rates to attract deposits are higher than the rates being paid on its renewing deposits 
interest on borrowings increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of a higher level of average borrowings outstanding during the year ended march  of million compared to million during the year ended march  along with the increasing interest rate environment in fiscal the significant increase in fiscal was related to funding the bank s loan growth during the year 
the vast majority of this borrowing growth was in short term borrowings  consistent with the shorter term  prime based loan growth the bank experienced during the year 
the bank continues to utilize wholesale borrowings in order to further leverage its balance sheet and better manage its interest rate risk profile 
provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual historical industry loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of period   provision for loan losses   charge offs  net of recoveries allowance at end of period   allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans receivable at the end of the period net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding during the period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming assets at the end of period   the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  this change resulted from management s ongoing analysis of changes in loan portfolio composition by collateral categories  overall credit quality of the portfolio  peer group analysis  and current economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of net loans receivable at march  compared to million  or of net loans receivable at march  the increased allowance level resulted from continued loan portfolio growth in the higher risk lending categories of construction and land development  commercial real estate and commercial business loans during the period  which comprised million  or of total loans receivable at march   versus million  or at march  as of march   there were no loans in the loan portfolio over days delinquent and five loans on non accrual status

noninterest income in fiscal increased to million  from million in fiscal service fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was the implementation of our overdraft protection service during fiscal  which  together with the increase in deposits  resulted in increased fee income 
there was a net loss on sales of investment securities of  in fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the losses in fiscal were a result of management s decisions to replace certain investment securities during the year in its efforts to improve future returns 
the losses in fiscal were a result of the restructuring of approximately million of lower yielding securities during the fourth quarter of fiscal the proceeds from these sales have since been reinvested in highly rated  higher yielding investments 
the securities sold were yielding approximately basis points lower than the securities purchased  therefore the effect of this restructuring was to increase interest income from these securities by over  in fiscal other noninterest income decreased slightly to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ending march  noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in fiscal increased to million  a increase from million in fiscal compensation and employee benefits increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal building occupancy expense was million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal increases in compensation and employee benefits and building and occupancy expenses resulted primarily from the opening of a full service retail office in lakewood  washington in fiscal and a full service regional facility in everett  washington in june other noninterest expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to additional transfer agent and investor relations expenses  and increased business occupation tax as a result of the shifting loan portfolio from non taxable mortgage loans to taxable commercial loans

liquidity and capital resources the bank maintains liquid assets in the form of cash and short term investments to provide a source to fund loans  savings withdrawals  and other short term cash requirements 
at march   the bank had liquid assets cash and marketable securities with maturities of one year or less with a book value of million 
as of march   the total book value of investments and mortgage backed securities was million compared to a market value of million with an unrealized gain of million

the corporation foresees no factors that would impair its ability to hold debt securities to maturity 
as indicated on the corporation s consolidated statement of cash flows contained in item of this form k  the corporation s primary sources of funds are cash flow from operations  which consist primarily of mortgage loan repayments  deposit increases  loan sales  borrowings and cash received from the maturity or sale of investment securities 
the corporation s liquidity fluctuates with the supply of funds and management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate at this time 
if additional liquidity is needed  the corporation s options include  but are not necessarily limited to i selling additional loans in the secondary market  ii entering into reverse repurchase agreements  iii borrowing from the fhlb of seattle  iv accepting additional jumbo  brokered  and or public funds deposits  or v accessing the discount window of the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
stockholders equity as of march  was million  or of assets  compared to million  or of assets at march  the bank continues to exceed the minimum tier one capital required by the fdic in order to be considered well capitalized 
the bank s total risk adjusted capital ratio as of march  was  compared to as of march  these figures remain well above the well capitalized minimum of set by the fdic 
the corporation has conducted various buy back programs since august in march  the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan that runs concurrent with the fiscal year  allowing the corporation to repurchase up to of total shares outstanding  or approximately  shares 
this marked the corporation s tenth stock repurchase plan 
in fiscal  under the previous plan  the corporation repurchased  shares at an average price of 
for additional information concerning the corporation s repurchase activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  see item of this form k 
management intends to continue its stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock is perceived to contribute to the overall growth of stockholder value 
the number of shares of stock to be repurchased and the price to be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the corporation 
the primary factors  however  are market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market  the number of shares available in the market  the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment  the ability to increase the value and or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares  the corporation s liquidity and capital needs  and regulatory requirements 
presently  it is management s belief that purchases made under the current board approved plan will not materially affect the corporation s capital or liquidity position 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation continues to be exposed to interest rate risk 
currently  the corporation s assets and liabilities are not materially exposed to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
at march   the corporation had no off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  nor did it have a trading portfolio of investments 
in fiscal and fiscal  the corporation continued to outsource its interest rate risk modeling to a third party provider that utilizes an ips sendero model 
this model analyzes the corporation s major balance sheet components  and attempts to estimate the changes to the corporation s income statement and economic value of equity  under a variety of interest rate change scenarios 
the figures contained in the table presented under item a of this form k below  in the quantitative disclosures about market risk section  were derived from this model 
while numerous assumptions go into this modeling  and undue reliance should not be placed on the specific results  management believes that this improved modeling will enhance its interest rate risk management efforts 
similar to the analysis performed one year ago  the current interest rate risk modeling continues to show the bank s balance sheet as moderately asset sensitive over a month time period 
the bank s continued focus on shorter term  variable rate assets has contributed to the bank s performance in this regard 
this strategy has allowed the bank to utilize wholesale borrowing and brokered deposits as a supplemental source of funds to its retail and commercial deposit gathering efforts  without significantly impacting the bank s interest rate risk profile 
in addition  the bank has been successful at increasing its demand deposit base in recent years  further enhancing the bank s interest rate risk profile 
accordingly  the interest rate risk modeling performed each quarter during fiscal shows that the bank continues to operate within the interest rate risk tolerance limits set by its board of directors 
with the current level of interest rates at march  and the associated prepayment assumptions in the low rate environment  interest rate risk modeling predicts moderate improvement in the bank s performance in a moderately higher rate environment over a month time period 
however  as interest rates increase  prepayment assumptions can change significantly  therefore it would be inappropriate to assume that significantly higher rates would have a sustained positive effect on the bank s and the corporation s performance 
further  an increase in rates  without a corresponding increase in certain indices such as prime  would adversely affect the corporation s performance 
for example  if it becomes necessary for the corporation to increase the rates it pays to attract funds in a rising rate environment as is the case currently  an absence of a corresponding increase in the prime lending rate would  of course  negatively affect performance 
in addition  depending on timing differences  the magnitude of various rates change in future periods  and the composition of the corporation s balance sheet  future modeling efforts may show the corporation s returning to a liability sensitive position 
management continues to monitor these areas  in its ongoing effort to manage the corporation s interest rate risk 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  the corporation enters into contractual obligations that meet various business needs 
these contractual obligations include time deposits to customers  borrowings from the fhlb of seattle and lease obligations for facilities

the following table summarizes the corporation s long term contractual obligations at march  less than one to three to one three five year years years total in thousands time deposits     long term borrowings    operating lease obligations 
 total off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the corporation makes off balance sheet arrangements  including credit commitments to its customers to meet their financial needs 
these arrangements involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the bank makes personal  commercial  and real estate lines of credit available to customers as well as stand by letters of credit or financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit to customers are subject to the bank s normal credit policies and are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time as a result of inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of noninterest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
our management is unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value as a result of inflation

as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  in the event of changes in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and withdrawals from savings accounts might deviate significantly from those assumed in presenting the table 
therefore  the data presented in the table should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results
