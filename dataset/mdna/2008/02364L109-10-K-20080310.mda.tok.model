item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue net of contractual allowances and cost recognition including the estimated cost of off site medical claims  allowance for doubtful accounts  loss contracts  professional and general liability self insurance retention  other self funded insurance reserves  legal contingencies  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  and share based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition the company s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts with revenue adjustments for census fluctuations and risk sharing arrangements  such as stop loss provisions and aggregate limits for off site or pharmaceutical costs 
such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated by either party without cause upon proper notice 
revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered 
cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed 
revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three general categories fixed fee  population based  or cost plus a fee 
for fixed fee contracts  revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract irrespective of inmate population 
revenues for population based contracts are calculated either on a fixed fee that is subsequently adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate multiplied by the average inmate population for the period of service 
for cost plus a fee contracts  revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual fee 

table of contents normally  contracts will also include additional provisions which mitigate a portion of the company s risk related to cost increases 
off site utilization risk is mitigated in the majority of the company s contracts through aggregate pools or caps for off site expenses  stop loss provisions  cost plus a fee arrangements or  in some cases  the entire exclusion of certain or all off site service costs 
pharmacy expense risk is similarly mitigated in certain of the company s contracts 
typically under the terms of such provisions  the company s revenue under the contract increases to offset increases in specified cost categories such as off site expenses or pharmaceutical costs 
for contracts which include such provisions  the company recognizes the additional revenues due from clients based on its estimates of applicable contract to date costs incurred as compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs 
because such provisions typically specify how often such additional revenue may be invoiced and require all such additional revenue to be ultimately settled based on actual expenses  the additional revenues are initially recorded as unbilled receivables until the time period for billing has been met and actual costs are known 
any differences between the company s estimates of incurred costs and the actual costs are recorded in the period in which such differences become known along with the corresponding adjustment to the amount of recorded additional revenues 
under all contracts  the company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances for potential adjustments resulting from a failure to meet performance or staffing related criteria 
if necessary  the company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined 
revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon delivery of the related products 
the table below illustrates these revenue categories as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations for the years ended december   and percentage of revenue from continuing operations for the year ended for the year ended for the year ended contract category december  december  december  fixed fee population based cost plus a fee pharmacy revenue pharmacy revenue is revenue recognized by spp 
effective april   spp sold certain of its assets to maxor 
for more information  see item general business 
contracts under the population based and fixed fee categories generally have similar margins which are higher than margins for contracts under the cost plus a fee category 
cost plus a fee contracts generally have lower margins but with much less potential for variability due to the limited risk involved 
the company s profitability under each of the three general contract categories discussed above varies based on the level of risk assumed under the contract terms with the most potential for variability being in contracts under the population based or fixed fee categories which do not contain the risk mitigating provisions related to off site utilization described above 
for the year ended december   contracts accounting for approximately of the company s correctional healthcare services revenues from continuing operations do not contain such risk mitigating provisions 
healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing and or administering the managed care including the costs associated with services provided and or administered by off site medical providers  the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other self funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below 
the cost of healthcare services provided  administered or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided and or administered based in part on estimates  including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date 
the company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using actual utilization data including hospitalization  one day surgeries  physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs  which are estimated using the average historical cost of such services 
additionally  the company s utilization management personnel perform a monthly review of inpatient hospital stays in order to identify any stays which would have a cost in excess of the historical average rates 
once identified  reserves for such stays are determined which take into consideration the specific facts of the stay 
an actuarial analysis is also prepared at least quarterly as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the company s total accrual related to contracts which have sufficient claims payment history 
the analysis takes into account historical claims experience including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services and other actuarial data 
actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the company s current estimates 
the differences could be material if significant fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are 
table of contents recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made 
in  and  the company recorded decreases of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to its prior year claims liabilities as a result of revisions to its estimated claims expense 
the impact to net income loss of these reductions to the company s claims reserves and associated expense is dependent upon whether any of the associated customer contracts contained provisions limiting risk of off site costs 
for  the overall decrease in claims liabilities is net of an increase to the claims liabilities associated with two former full risk contracts resulting in a negative impact to the company s net income loss of million 
the reductions to claims reserves in and did not result in a significant impact to the company s net income loss as the changes occurred primarily at contracts which contained provisions limiting risk of off site costs and  as a result  were off set by corresponding reductions to revenue 
additionally  along with other information  an actuarial analysis is prepared at least quarterly as an additional tool in evaluating the adequacy of the company s reserves for self insurance retention for certain reported as well as unreported professional and general liability claims associated with the delivery of medical services and included in accrued expenses and noncurrent portion of accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next 
furthermore  payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made and a corresponding change in healthcare expenses 
the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred ie  expected future healthcare costs and maintenance costs will exceed anticipated future revenue and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value 
the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  significant one time events  contractual rights  client funding and or political pressures  discussions with clients and historical experience 
if circumstances change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted and such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which they are recorded 
unbilled accounts receivable generally represent additional revenue earned under shared risk contracting models that remain unbilled at each balance sheet date  due to provisions within the contracts governing the timing for billing such amounts 
the company and its clients will  from time to time  have disputes over amounts billed under the company s contracts 
the company records a reserve for contractual allowances in circumstances where it concludes that a loss from such disputes is probable 
the company s more significantly aged receivable balances  net of reserves  are discussed below 
as discussed more fully in part i item legal proceedings  at december   phs had approximately million of gross billed receivables due from a former client  hillsborough county sheriff s office hcso whose contract terminated prior to january  approximately million of these receivables relate to billings for costs incurred by the company for offsite medical services and pharmacy costs which are in excess of the company s maximum exposure for such costs as set forth under the company s contract that was in effect with hcso 
the remaining receivables represent interest accrued on the past due balances under the terms of the contract 
hcso has  to date  refused to make payments on the outstanding receivables arguing that the company had not adequately researched whether there was alternative third party insurance payors who should have paid for the offsite medical services in question 
the company believes that its process for identifying such potential third party payors complied with the terms of its contract with hcso 
on november   the company filed a formal complaint seeking collection of the outstanding receivables 
on february   hcso filed a counter claim seeking million for alleged damages see part i item legal proceedings 
discovery is currently proceeding on both claims 
the company believes hcso s counter claim is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it 
the company has recorded reserves totaling approximately million related to these receivables 
due to the age of the receivables  the current litigation and the lack of an ongoing business relationship between the company and the former client  there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility related to these receivables 
however  the company had valid contracts with this former client under which services were priced  performed and billed  therefore  the company believes that these receivables are contractually due under the terms of the expired contract and that the former client has the resources to make payment 
as a result  the company believes the risk of a material loss is not probable and that no additional reserves are required at this time 
however  should phs be unsuccessful in its suit  such result could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial position 
these receivables are classified as other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as discussed more fully in part i item legal proceedings  phs is currently involved in three lawsuits with its former client  baltimore county  maryland the county  one of the three lawsuits involves the county s lack of payment for services rendered 
phs has approximately million of receivables due from the county  primarily related to services rendered between april  and september   the date the company s relationship with the county was terminated 
the county has refused to pay phs for these amounts and therefore  on october   phs filed suit against the county in the circuit court for baltimore county  maryland seeking collection of the outstanding receivable balances and damages for breach of contract  quantum meruit and unjust enrichment 
the company is of the opinion that it will prevail in this lawsuit as it continued to 
table of contents provide services to the county as desired by the county and the amounts are fixed in nature and were billed in accordance with the terms of the expired contract part i item legal proceedings 
accordingly  the company believes that the outstanding accounts receivable from the county to the company represent valid receivables for services rendered by the company and any amounts ultimately deemed to be uncollectible  if any  will not be material to the financial statements 
these receivables are classified as other noncurrent assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company had two contracts with a former client one of which was terminated by the company in december and the other expired in january as of december   the company has million in outstanding receivables due from this former client resulting from contractual billings for services rendered by the company 
collection of these receivables has been delayed pending the completion of a reconciliation of amounts due to the former client by the company related to services rendered on behalf of the company at a medical facility operated by the former client 
as of december   this reconciliation is substantially complete and the company has recorded liabilities totaling million due to the former client which represents its best estimate of the amounts due the former client for the services rendered to the company 
these liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes it will complete this reconciliation process during and at that time  will collect the outstanding receivable balances 
although there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility related to this amount due to the age of this receivable  the company believes the risk of a material loss is not probable and that no reserves are required at this time 
the company is involved in a dispute with a former client whose contract term ended on october   where the client withheld approximately million from payments of receivables due the company 
the company has recorded approximately million of contractual allowances which it estimates as the amount potentially due to the client related to staffing penalties under the contract 
the company is challenging the former clients ability to assess staffing penalties under the initial term of the contract and the method of calculating the assessment 
the remaining million of the withheld amount due from this former client is primarily related to liquidated damages assessed by the former client 
the company is challenging this amount withheld for liquidated damages as well as the process by which the damages were estimated by the former client 
the contract with the former client sets forth specific items for which damages could be assessed and maximum amounts for each item 
the former client s assessment of damages did not relate to items for which damages could be assessed under the terms of the contract nor did it provide a calculation of the method used to estimate the damages for the alleged deficiencies 
therefore  the company has recorded no reserve for this remaining amount totaling million 
although there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility related to this amount due to the dispute and age of this receivable  the company believes the risk of a material loss is not probable and that no additional reserves are required at this time 
the company is involved in a dispute with a current client over billed receivables totaling approximately million net of reserves 
these receivables were invoiced to the client in the second quarter of and represent amounts paid under a settlement between the company and a local healthcare provider 
under the terms of the contract between the company and this client  the company is allowed to bill the client for costs incurred such as those described above 
the company has a valid contract with this client under which services were performed  priced and billed 
although there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility related to this amount due to the age of this receivable  the company believes the risk of a material loss is not probable and that no additional reserves are required at this time 
as stated in each of the cases above  the company believes the recorded amounts represent valid receivables which are contractually due from clients  and other than the recorded reserves  expects full collection 
however  due to the factors discussed above  there is a heightened risk of uncollectibility of these receivables which may result in future losses in excess of such reserves 
nevertheless  the company intends to take all necessary and available measures in order to collect these receivables 
changes in circumstances related to the matters discussed above  or any other receivables  could result in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts or the estimate of contractual adjustments in future periods 
such change  if it were to occur  could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial position in the period in which the change occurs 
loss contracts on a quarterly basis  the company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a loss contract reserve for succeeding periods 
the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future contractual revenue  projected future healthcare and maintenance costs  projected future stop loss insurance recoveries and each contract s specific terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare costs 
the projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management s estimate of future cost increases 
these estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted 

table of contents maryland department of public safety and correctional services 
the company s contract with the maryland department of public safety and correctional services maryland dps historically underperformed  fluctuating between minimal profitability  break even and losses 
this contract was entered into on july  to provide comprehensive medical services to four regions of the maryland prison system 
the initial term of the contract was for the three years ended june   with the maryland dps having the ability to renew the contract for two additional one year terms 
the second renewal term of the contract expired june  under the terms of the contract  the maryland dps paid the company a flat fee per month with certain limited cost sharing adjustments for staffing costs  primarily nurses  and the cost of medications related to certain specific illnesses 
the company was fully at risk for increases in hospitalization and outpatient costs under the terms of the contract with the maryland dps 
the contract also contained provisions that allowed the maryland dps to assess penalties if certain staffing or performance criteria were not maintained 
the flat fee paid to the company was increased annually based on a portion of the consumer price index 
due to the flat fee nature of this contract  the company s margin under the contract was significantly impacted by changes in healthcare costs  utilization trends or inmate population 
the company incurred losses under this contract in april at a level slightly above expectations 
the losses under the contract increased significantly in may to approximately million for the month 
the primary cause for the increased loss was an unanticipated increase in hospitalization costs beginning in may  resulting from the volume and acuity of services being provided  the number of hiv and mental health patients and the costs associated with current treatment guidelines 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax loss contract charge of million  effective june   which represented its most likely estimate  at that date  of the future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the maryland dps contract through its expiration on june  this estimate assumed monthly losses under the contract would diminish from the may level  which was viewed as an aberration  to approximately million per month  including allocated overhead  an amount significantly above recent historical levels 
during the third quarter of  the company utilized million of its loss contract reserve  almost entirely due to the underperformance of the maryland dps contract 
while actual monthly losses incurred under the maryland dps contract had trended downward from the record loss in may  losses once again increased in september  driven primarily by off site medical costs 
off site medical costs under the maryland dps contract averaged million per month for june through september  as compared with initial estimates of million per month  based on historical results 
as a result of this new and more severe trend  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  effective september   to increase its reserve for estimated future losses and allocated corporate overhead under the maryland dps contract until its expiration on june a fundamental assumption of the million increase in loss reserve was that the contract would continue to incur on average million per month of off site medical costs through its termination on june  through april  actual losses incurred under the contract approximated the estimated amounts 
in may  off site medical costs incurred under the maryland dps contract increased to million  a level significantly above previous experience 
these increased costs continued in june resulting in the company recording an additional million increase to its reserve for loss contracts 
this pre tax loss contract charge of million is reflected as a component of income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
on june   the company s contract with the maryland dps expired 
subsequent to june   the company no longer has a loss contract reserve 
in the course of performing its reviews in future periods  the company might identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances 
circumstances that might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include interpretations regarding contract termination or expiration provisions  unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure  inmate population or the utilization of outside medical services in a contract  where such changes are not offset by increased healthcare revenues 
should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period  the company would record  in the period in which such identification is made  a reserve for the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract 
the identification of a loss contract in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which the reserve is recorded 
professional and general liability self insurance retention as a healthcare provider  the company s business occassionally results in actions for negligence and other causes of action related to its provision of healthcare services with the attendant risk of substantial damage awards  or court ordered non monetary relief such as  changes in operating practices or procedures  which may lead to the potential for substantial increases in the company s operating expenses 
the most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging negligent healthcare services  deliberate indifference to their medical needs or the lack of timely or adequate healthcare services 
the company may also be liable  as employer  for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or healthcare professionals with whom it 
table of contents contracts 
the company s contracts generally provide for the company to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the company and its agents 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains a primary professional liability insurance program  principally on a claims made basis 
for through with respect to the majority of its patients  the company purchased commercial insurance coverage  but is effectively self insured due to the terms of the coverage which include adjustable premiums 
for and  the company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a retro premium with adjustment based on actual losses after a minimum of months 
for  and  the company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a retro premium with adjustment based on actual losses after a minimum of months 
the company s ultimate premium for its through policies will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods 
for  the company is insured through a claims made policy subject to per event and aggregate coverage limits 
any amounts ultimately incurred above these coverage limits would be the responsibility of the company 
management establishes reserves for the estimated losses that will be incurred under these insurance policies after taking into consideration the company s professional liability claims department and external counsel evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claim history  actuarial analysis and coverage limits where applicable 
any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings 
given the fact that many claims are not brought during the year of occurrence  in addition to its reserves for known claims  the company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported claims 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
the company s estimates of this reserve are supported by various analyses  including an actuarial analysis  which is obtained on a quarterly basis 
at december   the company s reserves for both known and incurred but not reported claims totaled million 
reserves for medical malpractice claims fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next 
furthermore  payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between management s established reserves and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice claims in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
in  and  the company recorded increases of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to its prior year claims reserves as a result of adverse development on individual claims or matters 
the reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third party insurance carriers used by the company 
if a third party insurance carrier fails to meet its contractual obligations under the agreement with the company  the company would then be responsible for such obligations 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
other self funded insurance reserves as of december   the company has approximately million in accrued liabilities for employee health and workers compensation claims 
approximately million of this amount is related to workers compensation claims  of which approximately million is included within the noncurrent portion of accrued expenses as it is not expected to be paid within a year 
the company is essentially self insured for employee health and workers compensation claims subject to certain individual case stop loss levels 
as such  its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability to control claims 
the company accrues the estimated liability for employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and estimated time lag between the incident date and the date of actual claim payment 
the company accrues the estimated liability for workers compensation claims based on evaluations of the merits of the individual claims and analysis of claims history 
an actuarial analysis is prepared at least annually as an additional tool to be considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the company s reserve for workers compensation claims 
these estimates of self funded insurance reserves could change in the future based on changes in the factors discussed above 
any adjustments resulting from such changes in estimates are reflected in current earnings 
in  and  the company recorded an increase of approximately million  an increase of approximately million and a decrease of approximately million  respectively  to its prior year other self insurance reserves as a result of revisions to its estimated claims experience 
legal contingencies in addition to professional and general liability claims  the company is also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
such proceedings generally relate to labor  employment or contract matters 
when estimable  the company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and are based upon an estimated range of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe any of these current proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions  new developments or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill acquired is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performed its annual review as of december  based on the results of this annual review  management has determined that goodwill is not impaired as of december  future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the company s goodwill is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer contracts acquired in acquisitions and covenants not to compete  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review include the following significant underperformance or loss of key contracts relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the company s assets or in the company s overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review  any impairment is measured using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
when the company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis  taking into account new facts and circumstances  including its retention rate for acquired contracts 
if such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable  the company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas no 
further states forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
at december   the company s valuation allowance of approximately million represents management s estimate of state net operating loss carryforwards which will expire unused 
the company adopted the provisions of interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  the company performed a comprehensive review of its uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by fin in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents the company s treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return 
prior to adoption of fin  the company had a tax contingency accrual totaling million reflected as a component of accrued liabilities 
however  as a result of this review and the adoption of fin effective january   the company decreased its tax contingency accrual by million and increased retained earnings by a corresponding amount 

table of contents the company s tax contingency accruals are reviewed quarterly and can be adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law  and emerging legislation 
adjustments to the tax contingency accruals are recorded in the period in which the new facts or circumstances become known  therefore the accruals are subject to change in future periods and such change  if it were to occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to its tax contingencies as income tax expense 
as the company has no tax contingencies at december   there is no accrued interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the year ended december  the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions 
the company may be subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years through additionally  open tax years related to certain state and local jurisdictions remain subject to examination 
share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  the company also uses judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited
