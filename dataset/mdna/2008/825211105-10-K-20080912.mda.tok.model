item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed above in the section entitled risk factors 
we report results on a fiscal year ending june for ease of reference within this section  refers to the fiscal year ended june   refers to the fiscal year ended june   and refers to the fiscal year ended june  overview we are a leading provider of ip telecommunications solutions for enterprises 
our solution is comprised of our shoregear switches  shorephone ip phones and shoreware software applications 
we were founded in september and shipped our first system in we have continued to develop and enhance our product line since that time 
we currently offer a variety of models of our switches and ip phones 
we sell our products primarily through channel partners that market and sell our systems to enterprises across all industries  including to small  medium and large companies and public institutions 
we believe our channel strategy allows us to reach a larger number of prospective enterprise customers more effectively than if we were to sell directly 
the number of our authorized channel partners has more than doubled since june  to over as of june  channel partners typically purchase our products directly from us 
our internal sales and marketing personnel support these channel partners in their selling efforts 
in some circumstances  the enterprise customer will purchase products directly from us  but in these situations we typically compensate the channel partner for its sales efforts 
at the request of the channel partner  we often ship our products directly to the enterprise customer 
most channel partners generally perform installation and implementation services for the enterprises that use our systems 
in most cases  our channel partners provide the post contractual support to the enterprise customer by providing first level support services and purchasing additional services from us under a post contractual support contract 
for channel partners without support capabilities or that do not desire to provide support  we offer full support contracts to provide all of the support to enterprise customers 
we outsource the manufacturing of our products to contract manufacturers 
our outsourced manufacturing model allows us to scale our business without the significant capital investment and on going expenses required to establish and maintain a manufacturing operation 
our phone and switch products are manufactured by two 
table of contents contract manufacturers located in san jose  california and china 
our contract manufacturers provide us with a range of operational and manufacturing services  including component procurement  final testing and assembly of our products 
we work closely with our contract manufacturers to manage the cost of components  since our total manufacturing costs are directly tied to component costs 
we regularly provide forecasts to our contract manufacturers  and we order products from our contract manufacturers based on our projected sales levels well in advance of receiving actual orders from our enterprise customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of finished goods inventory to meet our forecasted product sales with limited levels of inventory to compensate for unanticipated shifts in sales volume and product mix 
although we have historically sold our systems primarily to small and medium sized enterprises  we expanded our sales and marketing activities to increase our focus on larger enterprise customers 
accordingly  we have a major accounts program whereby our sales personnel assist our channel partners to sell to large enterprise accounts  and we coordinate with our channel partners to enable them to better serve large multi site enterprises 
to the extent we are successful in penetrating larger enterprise customers  we expect that the sales cycle for our products will increase  and that the demands on our sales and support infrastructure will also increase 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california and the majority of our personnel work at this location 
sales and support personnel are located throughout the united states and  to a lesser extent  in the united kingdom  germany  belgium  spain  hong kong  singapore and australia 
while we expanded our operations to europe in and to the asia pacific region in  most of our enterprise customers are located in the united states 
revenue from international sales has been or less of our total revenue for   and  respectively 
although we intend to focus on increasing international sales  we expect that sales to enterprise customers in the united states will continue to comprise the significant majority of our sales 
we have experienced significant growth in past two years  with our total revenue growing to million for from million for this growth in revenue has largely been driven by increased demand for ip telecommunications systems from new enterprise customers  as well as sales of additional products to our installed enterprise customer base 
our operating expenses have also increased significantly to million for from million for this growth in operating expenses has primarily been driven by our growth in headcount  to employees at june   as compared with employees at june  we expect to continue to add personnel in all functional areas 
key business metrics we monitor a number of key metrics to help forecast growth  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts and measure operational effectiveness 
initial and repeat sales orders 
our goal is to attract a significant number of new enterprise customers and to encourage existing enterprise customers to purchase additional products and support 
many enterprise customers make an initial purchase and deploy additional sites at a later date  and also buy additional products and support as their businesses expand 
as our installed enterprise customer base has grown we have experienced an increase in revenue attributable to existing enterprise customers  which currently represents a significant portion of our total revenue 
deferred revenue 
nearly all system sales include the purchase of post contractual support contracts with terms of up to five years  and our renewal rates on these contracts have been high historically 
we recognize support revenue on a ratable basis over the term of the support contract 
since we receive payment for support in advance of our recognizing the related revenue  we carry a deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet 
this deferred revenue helps provide predictability to our future support and services revenue 
accordingly  the level of purchases of post contractual support with our product sales is an important metric for us along with the renewal rates for these services 
our deferred revenue balance at june  was million  of which million is expected to be recognized within one year 
gross margin 
our gross margin for products is primarily affected by our ability to reduce hardware costs faster than the decline in average overall system prices 
we strive to increase our product gross margin by reducing hardware costs through product redesign and volume discount pricing from our suppliers 
in general  
table of contents product gross margin on our switches is greater than product gross margin on our ip phones 
as the prices and costs of our hardware components have decreased over time  our software components  which have lower costs than our hardware components  have represented a greater percentage of our overall margin on system sales 
we consider our ability to monitor and manage these factors to be a key aspect of maintaining product gross margins and increasing our profitability 
gross margin for support and services is significantly lower than gross margin for products  and is impacted primarily by personnel costs and labor related expenses 
the primary goal of our support and services function is to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction and our investments in support personnel and infrastructure are made with this goal in mind 
we expect that as our installed enterprise customer base grows  we will be able to improve gross margin for support and services through economies of scale 
however  the timing of additional investments in our support and services infrastructure could materially affect our cost of support and services revenue  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of support and services revenue and total revenue  in any particular period 
operating expense management 
our operating expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and benefits for our employees and  therefore  the increase in operating expenses has been primarily related to increase in our headcount 
we intend to expand our workforce to support our anticipated growth  and therefore our ability to forecast revenue is critical to managing our operating expenses 
basis of presentation revenue 
we derive our revenue from sales of our ip telecommunications systems and related support and services 
our typical system includes a combination of ip phones  switches and software applications 
channel partners buy our products directly from us 
prices to a given channel partner for hardware and software products depend on that channel partner s volume and customer satisfaction metrics  as well as our own strategic considerations 
in circumstances where we sell directly to the enterprise customer in transactions that have been assisted by channel partners  we report our revenue net of any associated payment to the channel partners that assisted in such sales 
this results in recognized revenue from a direct sale approximating the revenue that would have been recognized from a sale of a comparable system through a channel partner 
product revenue has accounted for   and of our total revenue for  and  respectively 
support and services revenue primarily consists of post contractual support  and to a lesser extent revenue from training services  professional services and installations that we perform 
post contractual support includes software updates which grant rights to unspecified software license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period 
post contractual support also includes both internet and phone based technical support 
post contractual support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual service period 
cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of hardware costs  royalties and license fees for third party software included in our systems  salary and related overhead costs of operations personnel  freight  warranty costs and provision for excess inventory 
the majority of these costs vary with the unit volumes of product sold 
cost of support and services revenue consists of salary and related overhead costs of personnel engaged in support and services  and hence is substantially fixed in the near term 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs  outside engineering costs  professional services  prototype costs  test equipment  software usage fees and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses are recognized when incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products and related software applications 
we intend to continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts because we believe they are essential to maintaining and improving our competitive position 
accordingly  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include personnel costs  sales commissions  travel  marketing promotional and lead generation programs  advertising  trade shows  professional services fees and facilities expenses 
we plan to continue to invest in development of our distribution channel by 
table of contents increasing the size of our field sales force and the number of our channel partners to enable us to expand into new geographies  including europe and asia pacific  and further increase our sales to large enterprises 
in conjunction with channel growth  we plan to increase the investment in our training and support of channel partners to enable them to more effectively sell our products 
we also plan to continue investing in our domestic and international marketing activities to help build brand awareness and create sales leads for our channel partners 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and remain our largest operating expense category 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses relate to our executive  finance  human resources  legal and information technology organizations 
expenses primarily include personnel costs  professional fees for legal  accounting  tax  compliance and information systems  travel  recruiting expense  software amortization costs  depreciation expense and facilities expenses 
we also expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses related to our securities litigation matters and litigation with mitel 
in addition  as we expand our business  we expect to increase our general and administrative expenses 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily consists of interest earned on cash and investments and other miscellaneous income expenses 
income tax provision 
income tax provision includes federal  state and foreign tax on our income 
from inception through we accumulated substantial net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we fully reserved the deferred tax asset from these losses and tax credits on our financial statements 
we were profitable in  and and had an effective tax rate of approximately  and  respectively  as a result of utilizing portions of the deferred tax asset and reducing the related valuation allowance 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily driven by the increase in non deductible stock based compensation  the usage of available net operating losses in earlier years as well as the decrease in deferred tax assets available to offset taxable income 
we believe we have had multiple ownership changes  as defined under section of the internal revenue code  due to significant stock transactions in previous years  which may limit the future realization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards under sections and of the internal revenue code in future periods 
based on our final analysis  we believe the provisions of section will result in the forfeiture of federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively

we do not hold any auction rate securities in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio 
on july   we closed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
our principal uses of cash historically have consisted of the purchase of finished goods inventory from our contract manufacturers  payroll and other operating expenses related to the development of new products and purchases of property and equipment 

table of contents we believe that our million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at june   together with cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements for at least months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of our expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of our products and acquisition activities 
we may enter into agreements relating to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses or technologies in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the following table shows our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods year ended june  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our cash expenditures to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development  sales and marketing and administration 
our operating cash flows are also influenced by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory  accounts receivable  vendor accounts payable and other assets and liabilities 
we procure finished goods inventory from our contract manufacturers and typically pay them in days 
we extend credit to our channel partners and typically collect in to days 
we also prepay for license rights to third party products in advance of sales

net cash provided by operating activities in partly consisted of net income of million 
noncash adjustments were higher in compared to  including stock based compensation expense  which was higher in by million 
this was partially off set by a higher deferred tax benefit of million in in addition  the period to period change in cash flows relating to operating activities was also affected by an increase in deferred revenue of million  primarily due to the deferral of revenue from sales of post contractual support contracts exceeding the revenue recognized from post contractual support contracts  and an increase in accrued liabilities and other of million  accrued employee compensation of million  primarily attributable to increased headcount

these sources of cash were partially offset by uses of cash associated with an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased sales in compared to  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million and an increase in inventory of million 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities in primarily consisted of net income of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and an increase of million related to net changes in working capital 
of this million  the primary sources of cash were a million increase to accrued employee compensation  largely employee bonuses relating to company performance  increased deferred revenue relating to support contracts of million and increased accounts payable of  which was partially offset by increases to accounts receivable of million 
cash flows from investing activities we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we may hold investments in corporate bonds to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact to our overall liquidity 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to investments made in us government sponsored securities and corporate bonds and commercial paper and in was primarily for capital expenditures related to manufacturing tooling for the production of our hardware products  computer equipment for our research and development lab and to support our growth in headcount 
net cash used in investing activities in was for capital expenditures  primarily related to computer and lab equipment to support our growth in headcount and manufacturing tooling for production of our hardware products 
our requirements for additional capital expenditures are subject to change depending upon several factors  including our needs based on our changing business and industry and market conditions

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  and accounting for income taxes 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected

revenue recognition product revenue 
our software is integrated with our hardware and is essential to the functionality of the integrated system product 
product sales typically include a perpetual license to our software  except in limited circumstances such as sales of spare or replacement handsets  back up switches and additional business applications 
we recognize revenue for these sales in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  or staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as applicable  depending on whether the hardware is sold in a multiple element arrangement with software and post contractual support or on a standalone basis if the enterprise customer purchases hardware  software  or maintenance support separately 
for the initial sale  we generally bundle together the hardware  software  and post contractual support contracts with terms of up to five years 
thereafter  if the enterprise customer increases the number of end user deployments and or functionality  it may add more hardware  software  and related post contractual support by purchasing them separately 
we evaluate existence of vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for post contractual support and  installation and services and training  as noted below 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product has shipped or delivery has occurred depending on when title passes  the sales price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
our fee is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices 
our agreements generally do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions have been met or the right of return lapses 
we maintain a reserve for sales returns based on historical experience 
payment terms generally range from net to net days 
in the event payment terms are extended materially from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due 
we assess the ability to collect from channel partners based on a number of factors  including creditworthiness and past transaction history 
if the channel partner is not deemed creditworthy  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
shipping charges are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 

table of contents we monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience and expectation  additional allowances may be required 
we have arrangements with channel partners to reimburse the channel partners for cooperative marketing costs meeting specified criteria 
the reimbursements are limited to of the actual costs charged to the channel partners by third party vendors for advertising  trade shows and other related sales and marketing activities for which we receive an identifiable benefit  subject to a limit of the total cooperative marketing allowance earned by each channel partner 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  we record the reimbursements to the channel partners meeting such specified criteria within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
post contractual support 
our support and services revenue is primarily derived from post contractual support 
we account for post contractual support revenue based on sop  which states that if an arrangement includes multiple elements  the fee should be allocated to the various elements based on vsoe of fair value  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vsoe of fair value is limited to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe of fair value is established for support through prior renewals of post contractual support contracts  which establishes a price which is based on a standalone sale 
we use the residual method  as allowed by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  to determine the amount of product revenue to be recognized 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements  such as post contractual support  installation services and training  are deferred and the remaining portion of the sales amount is recognized as product revenue 
the fair value of the post contractual support is recognized as support and services revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the related support period  which can be up to five years in length 
installation and training 
installation services are sold on an elective basis 
channel partners or enterprise customers generally perform installations without our involvement  so we do not recognize substantial revenue from installation services 
as installation is typically performed by the channel partner or enterprise customer  it is not considered essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
installation is generally priced at established rates based on estimated hours to install our systems 
training services are also sold on an elective basis  both to channel partners and to enterprise customers  and is purchased both with system orders and on a standalone basis 
vsoe of fair value has been established for training 
we recognize revenue related to installation services and training upon delivery of the service 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for installation  training or commitments to provide specified upgrades  services or additional products to customers in the future  as has been the case from time to time in the past  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value does exist or all such elements from the arrangement have been delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis by assessing individual accounts receivable that materially exceed due dates 
risk assessment for these accounts includes historical collections experience with the specific account and with our similarly situated accounts coupled with other related credit factors that may evidence a risk of default and loss to us 
accordingly  the amount of this allowance will fluctuate based upon changes in revenue levels  collection of specific balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in channel partner credit quality or likelihood of collection 
if the financial condition of our channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances  including unforeseen declines in market conditions and collection rates  may result in additional allowances in the future or reductions in allowances due to future recoveries

effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas r only to awards newly granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled  after the adoption date 
under this transition method  our stock based compensation expense recognized beginning july  is based on the grant date fair value of stock option awards we grant or modify after july  prior to and during fiscal year  we categorized our options into two classes 
class one includes all options granted with standard four year vesting and no ability to exercise prior to vesting 
class two includes options granted with standard four year vesting but allow for early exercisability 
we discontinued granting class two options as of june  we recognize stock based compensation expense for both class one and class two on a straight line basis over the options expected vesting terms  generally four years 
we estimated the grant date fair value of stock option awards under the provisions of sfas r using the black scholes option valuation model with the following assumptions year ended june  year ended june  class one class two expected life of option plan years years years expected life of employee stock purchase plan espp years risk free interest rate range for option plan risk free interest rate for espp volatility for option plan volatility for espp dividend yield during  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense of million under sfas r 
in future periods  stock based compensation expense is expected to increase as we issue additional equity based awards to continue to attract and retain key employees 
additionally  sfas r requires that we recognize compensation expense only for the portion of stock options that are expected to vest  assuming an expected forfeiture rate in determining stock based compensation expense  which could affect the stock based compensation expense recorded if there is a significant difference between actual and estimated forfeiture rates 
our estimated forfeiture rate in the year ended june  was 
as of june   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock based awards granted to employees and non employee directors was million  net of estimated forfeitures of million

for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable  or fsp  provides that the warrants we have issued to purchase shares of series e and series f preferred stock are subject to the requirements in fsp  which requires us to classify these warrants as current liabilities and to adjust the value of these warrants to their fair value at the end of each reporting period 
we recorded  of expense in other income 
table of contents expense for  to reflect increase in the estimated fair value of the warrants 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at june  using the black scholes option valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of the underlying preferred stock at the valuation measurement date  the remaining term of the warrant  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends and expected volatility of the price of the underlying convertible preferred stock 
upon our initial public offering  subsequent to june   these warrants converted into warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and  as a result  are no longer subject to fsp at that time  the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants was reclassified from liabilities to common stock  a component of stockholders deficit  and we ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
inventory valuation inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market value  with cost being determined under a standard cost method that approximates first in  first out 
a small portion of our inventory also relates to evaluation units located at enterprise customer locations and service inventory 
inventory valuation reserves are established to reduce the carrying amounts of our inventories to their net estimated realizable values 
inventory valuation reserves are based on historical usage  expected demand and  with respect to evaluation units  conversion rate and age 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation reserves are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory valuation reserves could be required and would be reflected in cost of product revenue in the period in which the reserves are taken 
inventory valuation reserves were million and million as of june  and  respectively 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the unit to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
the reduced costs associated with the revenue from this unit results in an increase in gross profit and gross margin

 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit of which future realization is uncertain 
see note regarding the adoption of accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 effective july  the total valuation allowance decreased by approximately million in  primarily due to a reduction of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that management determined could not be utilized  based on a final analysis of the company s multiple ownership changes since inception as a result of significant stock transactions  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors  including the company s past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities 
as of june   management does not believe it is more likely than not that million of the million net deferred tax assets relating to us federal and state operations are realizable 
the company intends to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of some or all of the allowance 
in addition  the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to deferred tax assets which currently have no valuation allowance could result in an increase in the valuation allowance in a future period 
the company s income tax expense benefit recorded in the future will be reduced or increased in the event changes to the valuation allowance are required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts with major financial institutions to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the future 
we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding as of june  in addition  we currently hold our investment portfolio in accounts with two financial firms 
while we do not invest our cash in obligations of these firms  if either one or both of these firms were to experience financial or other regulatory difficulties  it might be difficult for us to access our investments in a timely manner 
we intend to place our investment portfolio with additional firms in an effort to spread our investment holdings with a number of different firms 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material positive impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments we held at june  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio  which had a fair value of million at june  market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus  and basis points bps
