since the beginning of the acquisition program in  the company has acquired a total of centers  representing million of annual estimated revenues 
revenues resulting from the centers acquired in for those that were not owned for the entire year in and from centers acquired in  combined  were approximately million 
from centers acquired in  only approximately million of revenues were recorded in due to the timing of the acquisition closings throughout the year 
toward the end of  the company entered into the north carolina market with two acquisitions representing five centers with total aggregate annual estimated revenues of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition program  the average number of centers increased from in to in the number of centers at the end of was early in  the company signed don shula as its spokesperson and at the end of the second quarter launched its television campaign just find out featuring coach shula 
the expenditures related to this new campaign were approximately  in the second quarter of management estimates that this campaign was a significant contributor to the increase in revenues from comparable centers which includes network revenues changes and the impact related to the fluctuation of the canadian exchange rate during the second half of the year over the same period of last year 
also earlier in the company entered into an agreement with the holders of the notes pursuant to which all of the notes were converted  the company paying down some principal and interest in cash and the holders converting the balance into shares of common stock 
in addition  the holders of the notes agreed to exercise all of their warrants at a reduced exercise price

in september of  we amended our agreements with siemens to defer repayment of approximately million from september to december  in the amendments  interest on our tranche d was increased but siemens agreed to provide the company with marketing expense reimbursements to support developing and promoting our business and advertising siemens products 
siemens also agreed to provide an additional million for operating expenses on an as needed basis through the end of see note long term debt  notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
during the second half of the year  the company restructured its management team by reducing its size and realigning responsibilities in order to be more efficient with its current operations and in facing anticipated growth in the years to come 
this restructuring resulted in reduction in wages exceeding million on an annualized basis before severance charges of approximately  recorded in the third and fourth quarter of also during that restructuring  the company implemented changes with its regional management team in order to increase their responsibilities related to the profitability of their specific region by putting in place new incentive compensations based on profitability 
furthermore  the company realigned some of its marketing  professional incentive compensation  products offering and pricing strategy to provide regional management with greater flexibilities in tailoring programs to specific regions 
overall in we increased revenues from both acquisitions and organic growth and we benefited from a significant increase in our rebate credits from siemens

the revenues from acquired centers percentage changes are calculated by dividing those revenues by the total of total net revenues 
the million or increase in net revenues over is principally a result of revenues from acquired centers which generated approximately million or over revenues and a slight increase in revenues from comparable centers of approximately above the total net revenues level 
the comparable centers total net revenues also include a favorable impact of  related to fluctuations in the canadian exchange rate from to in the increase in number of hearing aids sold over included an increase of from acquired centers which was offset by a decrease in the number of hearing aids sold in comparable centers from levels 
the impact of the decrease in the number of hearing aids sold from comparable centers was however offset by an increase in the average unit selling price of over average unit selling price 
the increase in average unit selling price is primarily due to a different mix of products resulting from patients selecting higher technology hearing aids 
the decrease in the number of units sold is in part attributable to the lower volume of florida medicaid business

management expects a reduction of  three quarters at  per quarter in in the total amount of siemens rebate credits when compared to due to the changes in tranche c payments referenced above

critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements goodwill the company s goodwill resulted from the combination with helix in and the acquisitions made since the inception of its acquisition program in on at least an annual basis  the company is required to assess whether its goodwill is impaired 
the company elected to perform this analysis on the first day of its fourth quarter 
in order to do this  management applied judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the reporting units determined by management are the centers  the network and e commerce 
the definition of the reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
the annual goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate an impairment charge 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
the company utilized an independent appraisal firm to test goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the company s fourth quarter during and  and each of these tests indicated no impairment 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of three methods quoted market price  external transactions  and discounted cash flow 
significant changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  stock price  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge

hearusa enters into provider agreements with benefit providers third party payors such as insurance companies  managed care companies  employer groups  etc 
under a a discount arrangement on products and service  b a fee for service arrangement  and c a per capita basis or capitation arrangements  which is a fixed per member per month fee received from the benefit providers 
all contracts are for one calendar year and are and cancelable with ninety days notice by either party 
under the discount arrangements  the company provides the products and services to the eligible members of a benefit provider at a pre determined discount or customary price and the member pays the company directly for the products and services 
under the fee for service arrangements  the company provides the products and services to the eligible members at its customary price less the benefit they are allowed a specific dollar amount  which the member pays directly to the company 
the company then bills the benefit provider the agreed upon benefit for the service 
under the capitation agreements  the company agrees with the benefit provider to provide their eligible members with a pre determined discount 
revenue under capitation agreements is derived from the sales of products and services to members of the plan and from a capitation fee paid to the company by the benefit provider at the beginning of each month 
the members that are purchasing products and services pay the customary price less the pre determined discount 
this revenue from the sales of products to these members is recorded at the customary price less applicable discount in the period that the product is delivered 
the direct expenses consisting primarily of the cost of goods sold and commissions on sales are recorded in the same period 
other indirect operating expenses are recorded in the period which they are incurred 
the capitation fee revenue is calculated based on the total members in the benefit provider s plan at the beginning of each month and is non refundable 
only a small percentage of these members may ever purchase product or services from the company 
the capitation fee revenue is earned as a result of agreeing to provide services to members without regard to the actual amount of service provided 
that revenue is recorded monthly in the period that the company has agreed to see any eligible members 
the company records each transaction at its customary price for the three types of arrangements  less any applicable discounts from the arrangements in the center business segment 
the products sold are recorded under the hearing aids and other products line item and the services are recorded under the service line item on the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue and expense are recorded when the product has been delivered  net of an estimate for return allowances 
revenue and expense from services and repairs are recorded when the services or repairs have been performed 
capitation revenue is recorded as revenue from hearing aids since it relates to the discount given to the members 
revenues are considered earned by the company at the time delivery of product or services have been provided to its customers when the company is entitled to the benefits of the revenues 
when the arrangements are related to members of benefit providers that are located outside the company owned centers territories  the revenues generated under these arrangements are included under the network business segment 
the company records a receivable for the amounts due from the benefit providers and a payable for the amounts owed to the affiliated providers 
the company only pays the affiliated provider when the funds are received from the benefit provider 
the company records revenue equal to the minimal fee for processing and administrative fees 
the costs associated with these services are operating costs  mostly for the labor of the network support staff and are recorded when incurred 
no contract costs are capitalized by the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of the accounts receivable of the company are from health insurance and managed care organizations and government agencies 
these organizations could take up to nine months before paying a claim made by the company and also impose a limit on the time the claim can be billed 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
that estimate is based on historical collection experience  current economic and market conditions  and a review of the current status of each customer s trade accounts receivable 
in order to calculate that allowance  the company first identifies any known uncollectible amounts in its accounts receivable listing and charges them against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
then a specific percent per plan and per aging categories is applied against the remaining receivables to estimate the needed allowance 
any changes in the percent assumptions per plan and aging categories results in a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  an increase of in the percent applied against the remaining receivables would increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  sales returns the company provides to all patients purchasing hearing aids a specific return period of at least days  or as mandated by state guidelines if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company provides an allowance in accrued expenses for returns 
the return period can be extended to days if the patient attends the company s help classes 
the company calculates its allowance for returns using estimates based upon actual historical returns 
the cost of the hearing aid is reimbursed to the company by the manufacturer 
vendor rebates the company receives various pricing rebates from siemens recorded based on the earning of such rebates by meeting the compliance levels of the supply agreement 
those levels relate to quarterly purchases of hearing aid products net of returns  known as minimum purchase requirements and also referred to as the minimum sales requirement 
at the end of each quarter  to establish compliance with those minimum purchase requirements  the company and siemens calculate the number of hearing aids sold by hearusa in the last four quarters and the percentage of those sales which were siemens products 
if at least of those sales were of siemens products  the company has earned the rebates equal to the required payments of principal and interest of tranche b and c and the rebates then reduce the outstanding balance on tranche b and c and accrued interest and reduce the cost of products sold for that quarter 
if in any fiscal quarter if the company has complied with the minimum sales requirement and has equaled or exceeded the total number of units sold in the same quarter of the prior year quarterly volume test  additional volume rebates of  per quarter are earned by the company and the rebates reduce the outstanding balance of tranches b or c and reduce the cost of products sold for that quarter 
these rebates are recorded monthly on a systematic basis based on supporting historical information that the company has met these compliance levels 
however if the company has complied with the minimum sales requirement and has sold less than but more than ninety five percent of the quarterly volume test  additional volume rebates of  per quarter are earned instead of the  by the company and the rebates reduce the outstanding balance of tranches b or c and reduce the cost of products sold for that quarter 
if the company exceeds by twenty five percent or more the quarterly volume test for any fiscal quarter  additional volume rebates of  for such quarter are earned in addition to the  and the rebates reduce the outstanding balance of tranches b or c and reduce the cost of products sold for that quarter 
the company does not currently record this rebate on a systematic basis because the compliance level has not historically been met 
if the company meets this compliance level in the future it will record the rebate on a quarterly basis when earned 
marketing allowances the company receives a monthly marketing allowance from siemens to reimburse the company for marketing and advertising expenses for promoting its business and siemens products 
the company s advertising rebates  which represent a reimbursement of specific incremental  identifiable advertising costs  are recorded as an offset to advertising expense 
if the cash consideration exceeds the allocated cost of advertising  the excess would be recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  it is considered to be impaired and would be written down to its fair value 
currently we have not experienced any events that would indicate a potential impairment of these assets  but if circumstances change we could be required to record a loss for the impairment of long lived assets 
stock based compensation share based payments are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term  the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term and an estimate of the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited 
the expected term is based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a historical volatility of our common stock for a period at least equal to the expected term 
estimated forfeitures are calculated based on historical experience 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
both the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to establish a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
although we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used  if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions  the balances of the deferred tax assets  liabilities and valuation allowance could be adversely affected 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of previously recognized deferred tax items  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under fin  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we recognize interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes

sfas  the fair value option for financial assets or financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements
