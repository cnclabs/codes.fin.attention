item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation all percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
operating results for the year ended december  are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future fiscal years 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
overview since our inception  we have invested heavily in developing technology  laboratory systems and software to automate  accelerate and digitize traditional r d and pursue high throughput materials research 
our scientific team has deep technical expertise that enables us to provide research services to our customers and to enter into longer term  broad technical alliances for discovery and development of new materials 
we apply our expertise in high throughput research technologies to offer a growing line of symyx tools to enable improved r d execution in our customers laboratories 
we also continue to expand symyx software  offering customers integrated r d collaboration  execution and analysis applications 
in october  we acquired mdl information systems  inc  significantly augmenting our symyx software offerings with access to scientific content and industry leading chemical informatics  logistics and decision support applications 
we generate revenue and cash flows from operations from licensing symyx software  subscriptions to certain scientific content and accompanying services and support  from selling and supporting symyx tools  from providing research services  and from licenses and royalties from our discovered materials  and intellectual property 
recent developments our major recent developments and their impact on our business are highlighted below completion of the mdl acquisition on october   we completed the acquisition of mdl information systems  inc  a delaware corporation  mdl information systems ag  a company organized under the laws of switzerland  mdl information systems japan kk  a company organized under the laws of japan  and mdl information systems sweden ab  a company organized under the laws of sweden collectively the mdl group companies or mdl  along with certain assets of elsevier limited  a company organized under the laws of england and wales  and mdl information systems uk limited  a company organized under the laws of england and wales 
the purchase price was million in cash  subject to certain working capital adjustments of approximately million 
sale of equity interest in ilypsa  inc ilypsa to amgen  inc 
amgen in july  amgen acquired ilypsa 
at the time of this transaction  we held an approximately of equity interest in ilypsa  which we transferred to amgen for million in cash received in august and up to an additional million cash to be received in july  subject to claims against the holdback provided for in this transaction 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid approximately million in income tax  primarily associated with this transaction 
execution of restructuring plan as part of the mdl acquisition  on october   we announced a restructuring plan to eliminate approximately positions worldwide  comprised of approximately positions in the united states and approximately positions internationally 
the estimated total restructuring charges are million  of which million had been paid out as of december  
table of contents entering into a supplemental agreement with the dow chemical company dow on november   we entered into a supplemental agreement with dow amending provisions of the i collaborative research and license agreement effective as of january  by and between the company and dow  as amended to date  and ii the alliance  technology transfer  research and license agreement effective as of january  by and among the company  symyx discovery tools  inc currently symyx tools  inc  a wholly owned symyx subsidiary  and dow  as amended to date 
under the supplemental agreement  dow has agreed to pay during the period through approximately million in i purchases of additional symyx tools and or research services  and ii minimum royalties payable quarterly and creditable against actual royalties earned 
symyx agreed to reduce royalty rates to encourage dow s full use and broad commercialization of technology developed under these agreements 
the new business relationship is consistent with our objectives to increase further the adoption of symyx technology within dow and to secure a more predictable revenue stream 
entering into a research and license agreement with exxonmobil in january  we entered into a research and license agreement rla effective january  with exxonmobil research and engineering company emre and exxonmobil chemical company and together with emre  collectively  exxonmobil 
we previously entered into an alliance  technology transfer and license agreement effective april  as amended  the attla with emre 
the rla supplements the attla  establishing certain terms governing a continuing relationship between symyx and exxonmobil as certain aspects of the attla conclude effective may  significant terms of the rla include i an agreement to extend two research projects we are currently performing for exxonmobil beyond may  for periods of thirteen and three months  respectively  ii mechanisms and pricing for exxonmobil to extend other existing attla projects and to initiate new projects  iii grant of certain symyx software and intellectual property licenses to exxonmobil  iv exxonmobil s commitment to the first year of maintenance support for such software and fixed pricing for an additional three years of support  v exxonmobil s grant of certain intellectual property licenses to us  vi the terms of our first year of software consulting services to exxonmobil and pricing for additional services  and vii cost based formulas for additional exxonmobil purchases of our tools and extended warranties for both existing and new tools 
initial commitments in the rla total approximately million in revenue incremental to the revenue currently committed under attla  of which we expect to recognize approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal  and substantially all of the balance in fiscal years and the rla did not modify the royalty provisions of the attla 
changes to business unit structure and management team during  we reorganized our company along three distinct business areas symyx software  symyx tools and symyx research 
in connection with these changes  we appointed new leaders for each of these units 
in addition  our chief executive officer steven goldby was appointed executive chairman  our president isy goldwasser was appointed chief executive officer  and our executive vice president  general counsel and secretary rex jackson was appointed chief financial officer 
we also appointed a senior vice president of sales and a principal accounting officer 
we believe these structural and management changes were important to our future growth initiatives 
release of isentris in october  we announced the release of symyx isentris v which offers significant enhancements over its predecessor  isis 
isentris provides opportunities to our customers to improve productivity through better data management  lowered cost of ownership  faster workflow processes and easier information access and reporting 
in the year ended december   we generated total revenue of million  with an operating loss of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
included in the operating and net income were purchase accounting adjustments and other special charges arising from acquisitions  including an approximately million in process research and development charge  million of amortization of intangible assets  and other merger related expenses 
net income also included the gain from the sale of our equity interest in ilypsa of million 
during  we had a net cash outflow from operations largely due to the fact that the income tax payment associated with the ilypsa transaction impacted cash from operations  while the proceeds from the sale were recorded in cash flows from investing activities 
after receiving million from the ilypsa sale and paying million net cash to acquire mdl  we ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 

table of contents our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of and to employees at the end of  primarily as the result of acquisitions 
we anticipate our headcount will not increase significantly in fiscal we recognized stock based compensation expenses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock based compensation expenses in was primarily due to the change in our compensation structure toward granting equity awards only to selected key employees and due to increase in forfeiture rate assumptions based on actual turnover rate 
stock based compensation expenses recognized in our results of operations for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands costs of revenue research and development sales  general and administrative total prior to january   we elected to follow apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements prior to january  in connection with stock based awards granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value on the grant date 
business acquisitions acquisition of mdl group companies on october   we completed the mdl acquisition 
we paid million in cash and expect to receive a working capital adjustment of million pursuant to the mdl sale agreement 
of the million cash paid  the parties placed million in escrow pending their determination of any detriments suffered or benefits enjoyed by mdl as a result of pre closing intercompany transactions between certain mdl group companies and the seller 
the results of mdl s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the preliminary purchase price to the tangible assets  deferred compensation  liabilities and intangible assets acquired  as well as in process research and development  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to our software business 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the total preliminary purchase price recorded for this acquisition was million  consisting of approximately million in cash net of estimated working capital adjustments  and million in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
the purchase price is preliminary because we have not yet determined the disposition of the amount in the above referenced escrow 
the preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows in thousands amount fair value of net liabilities assumed accrued restructuring costs in process research and development intangible assets deferred tax liabilities goodwill total 
table of contents the fair values of mdl s net liabilities as of the acquisition date were in thousands amount accounts receivable  net prepaids and other assets plant  property and equipment accounts payable and other accrued liabilities accrued compensation deferred revenue fair value of mdl s net liabilities the allocation of the consideration for the mdl acquisition to its individual assets and liabilities was based on management s analysis and estimates of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities 
in addition to the value assigned to in process research and development ipr d projects and mdl s tangible assets  specific intangible assets were identified and valued 
the identifiable intangible assets included customer relationships  core technology  proprietary content and various license agreements 
the ipr d project that mdl has been working on was the development of next generation mdl software 
that software had not yet been proven to be technologically feasible but had been developed to a point where it had value associated with potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing date of the acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the value of ipr d was determined using a cost to recreate approach 
this approach combines the costs incurred to date by the mdl development department  the product design department and development consultants 
in performing this preliminary purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  our intention for future use of the acquired assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of mdl s products 
the fair value of intangible assets was primarily based on the income approach 
the relief from royalty method and the with and without method under the income approach were utilized when appropriate 
the rates utilized to discount the after tax cash flows to their present values ranged from to 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return and the weighted average return on assets 
risks we identified and considered in this analysis included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful completion of development efforts  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
identifiable intangible assets purchased in the mdl acquisition consisted of the following in thousands  except for useful life with a weighted average useful life of years and no significant residual value amount useful life in years customer relationships core technology proprietary content elsevier license agreement third party license agreements trade name bargain lease total no goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents acquisition of autodose sa on july   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of privately held autodose sa autodose  a geneva  switzerland based maker of precision powder dispensing equipment 
by acquiring autodose  we now offer customers tools that combine autodose s powder handling technology with our existing liquid handling robotics technology

autodose has since been renamed symyx technologies europe sa and we include its results of operations in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
the purchase price for the autodose acquisition was  consisting of approximately  in cash and  in transaction costs  primarily legal and other professional service fees 
additional purchase price consideration of up to  may be payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in and by our autodose product line 
we will evaluate the possibility of achieving these targets from time to time and record the fair value of any further consideration as an additional cost of the acquisition 
no additional consideration was recorded as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the purchase price to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired  as well as ipr d  based on their estimated fair values

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates include the forfeiture rate for stock based awards  future warranty expenditures and product life cycles  and assumptions such as the elements comprising a revenue arrangement  including the distinction between software upgrades enhancements and new products  when technological feasibility is achieved for our products  the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  and determining when investment impairments are other than temporary 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  the emerging issues task force consensus on issue or eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and other authoritative accounting literature 
we generate revenue from services provided under research collaborations  the sale of products  license of software  content subscriptions  provision of support and maintenance services  and the license of intellectual property 
it is possible for our customers to work with us in multiple areas of our business and contracts may include multiple elements of service revenue  product revenue  and license and royalty revenue 
in determining the basis for non software product revenue recognition  we first determine the fair value of any extended warranty services and defer this revenue to be recognized over the service period 
for those contracts that involve multiple element deliverables  we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue among the units of accounting in accordance with eitf in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we recognize revenue from the software and software related elements  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality  in accordance with sop service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as support and maintenance or extended warranty agreements 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for symyx tools  comprising hardware  associated software and intellectual property licenses and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our software  intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory systems and software sold under license by third parties 
service revenue we recognize revenue from research agreements  software consulting agreements  and support and maintenance agreements as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized as earned upon performance of the services over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk until the milestones are completed  is recognized upon completion of these milestone events 
milestone payments to date have been immaterial 
revenue allocable to support and maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the support and maintenance is provided 
our software licenses may provide for technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis for periods defined within the contract 
revenue related to this post contract customer support is deferred and recognized over the term of the contracted support 
for those arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of the software  such services are considered essential to software functionality 
accordingly  revenue from the entire arrangement ie  software license  database subscriptions  post contract customer support pcs and professional services is deferred until final delivery and acceptance of the product and the revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining initial pcs period or upon final delivery and acceptance when the initial pcs period has already ended 

table of contents for many customers  we have developed custom registration and other tools that are typically delivered on a time and materials basis 
these custom development projects are generally not sold in connection with a new software license deal  but rather to customers that have been using our software products for an extended period of time 
revenue from these arrangements is usually recognized on a monthly basis as the services are delivered and invoiced 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of symyx tools hardware and the license of associated software  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance has been achieved 
a determination is made for each system delivered as to whether software is incidental to the system as a whole 
revenue from the sale of the symyx tools is earned and recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual method to allocate revenue to delivered elements once we have established fair value for all undelivered elements 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of delivery 
software license and database content fees for database content and software licensed on an annual right to use basis  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the license 
for revenue allocable to the software portion of a multiple element arrangement or licensed on a perpetual basis  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software product to the end user and commencement of the license  unless we have ongoing obligations for which fair value cannot be established or the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not probable  in which case we recognize revenue only when each of these criteria have been met 
by way of example  for the eln software products and the software products that we acquired from mdl  we have not yet established the fair value of certain ongoing obligations and accordingly  any perpetual license fees are recognized ratably over the period of the ongoing obligations typically a bundled support and maintenance commitment of one year 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value for any remaining undelivered elements can be established 
intellectual property license fees and royalties we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed or determinable 
we recognize royalty revenue based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
if there are extended payment terms  royalty revenue is recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 

table of contents stock based compensation prior to january   we elected to follow apb no 
and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements prior to january  in connection with stock based awards granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value on the grant date 
deferred compensation for options assumed in connection with business combinations was determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of our common stock on the date options were assumed 
deferred compensation was amortized on a graded vesting method through december  we adopted sfas r  effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized during the years after january  includes a espp awards with offering periods commencing  and stock options granted or assumed  prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  b espp awards with offering periods commencing subsequent to december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and c restricted stock units  restricted stock and stock options awarded subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods are not restated 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
warranty expense accrual a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a symyx tools system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each symyx tools system delivered and establishes the accrual based  in part  on reference to actual warranty costs incurred on similar systems 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material impact on our financial statements 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our original estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
in  and  we recorded favorable adjustments of approximately   and  respectively 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for research and development costs sfas  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to market 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material  and accordingly  we have expensed our software development costs when incurred 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost generally being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 

table of contents intangible assets we amortize intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill which is not subject to amortization  over their estimated economic lives 
determining the estimated economic life of intangible assets requires judgment on the part of management and can have a material effect on the result of operations 
for example  if we determined that the estimated economic lives of these assets were one year less than those reported in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the amortization expense of intangibles would have been increased by million 
we conduct impairment reviews of intangible assets annually or when circumstances indicate the potential impairment of intangible assets 
we also review the amortization periods for intangible assets when circumstances indicate there may be a change in economic lives of intangible assets 
valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists 
no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
accounting for income taxes income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we also recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority accordingly to financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
results of operations revenue amount in s change over previous year amount in s change over previous year amount in s service product license fees  content and royalties total revenue less than our total revenue in was  above revenue in  as increases in software consulting and maintenance revenue and product revenue offset a decline in research service revenue and license fees and royalties 
our total revenue increased from to  primarily due to the expansion of revenue under our alliances with exxonmobil and dow  particularly as a result of the increased sale of tools  as well as an increase in software license fees and royalties from new and existing customers 

table of contents revenue is attributed to the following geographic locations based on the physical location of symyx customers as a percentage of total revenue in the respective periods united states north america excluding united states asia europe total less than the following table lists our major customers for the years ended december   and and revenue generated from these customers as a percentage of our total revenue in the respective periods 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be generated from a few key customers  though with the mdl acquisition we have distributed revenue across a larger base of customers 
exxonmobil dow total we segregate revenue by the following businesses amount in s change over previous year amount in s change over previous year amount in s symyx research symyx tools symyx software materials and ip licensing symyx sensors total the reconciliation of segment revenue above to the revenue disclosed in the consolidated income statements is provided in note segment disclosure of notes to consolidated financial statements 
symyx research revenue the symyx research group generates revenue primarily from the providing collaborative and direct research services to our customers 
the decrease in symyx research revenue in was primarily due to the expiration of a number of collaborations 
in  revenue from symyx research decreased due to the expiration of our collaboration with british petroleum  partially offset by a new collaboration we started with d systems 
exxonmobil and dow continued to be our biggest customers  together contributing million revenue in to symyx research 
in november  we entered into a supplemental agreement with dow  and in january  we entered into a research and license agreement with exxonmobil 
both agreements provided additional commitments and guidelines for future business relationships between symyx and the respective customers 
we believe exxonmobil and dow will continue to be the major contributors to our symyx research revenue in the near term  but expect symyx research revenue to decrease significantly in as our main alliance agreement with exxonmobil expires mid year 

table of contents symyx tools revenue symyx tools generates revenue primarily from the sale of symyx tools and associated services 
symyx tools revenue increased to million in from million in and million in for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of services and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
the increase in symyx tools revenue was primarily due to increased shipments of symyx tools partially offset by lower average selling price 
during the years ended december   and  we shipped  and tools  respectively  including our core x modules and benchtop products  to chemical  life science  academic institutions  and several other customers 
included in shipments were tools for exxonmobil and dow as contracted according to their respective alliance agreements 
we also benefited from our strategy adopted in to provide modular systems to a broader customer base that we expect will contribute to symyx tools future results 
symyx software revenue symyx software generates revenue primarily from the licensing of software  including isentris  laboratory execution and analysis lea and electronic laboratory notebook eln software  licensing of content  and providing associated support  maintenance and consulting services 
symyx software revenue increased from million in to million in and million in the increase in symyx software revenue in was primarily due to the mdl acquisition and an increase in software consulting revenue  partially offset by lower software licensing revenue from certain large pharmaceutical companies 
the increase in symyx software revenue in was due primarily to increased revenue from software licenses and services provided particularly to large life science companies where our eln software has been adopted 
we expect symyx software revenue will grow the fastest in as we expand our customer base through the mdl acquisition 
materials licensing and ip revenue the materials and ip licensing group generates revenue primarily from the licensing fees received from licensing our intellectual property and from royalties paid by third party licensees for sale of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
materials and ip licensing revenue has not changed materially in the past three years 
we currently have seven materials commercialized by celanese  dow  jsr corporation and agfa gevaert nv we have additional materials eligible for customer commercialization  but cannot reliably predict if or when these materials will be commercialized  or the revenue impact to us in the event of commercial successes 
symyx sensors revenue the symyx sensors group  prior to its spin out into visyx technologies inc  provided development services and licenses for specific applications of our sensor technology 
symyx sensors revenue in consisted primarily of payments received from hella kg 
symyx sensors revenue increased significantly in over due primarily to payments received from univation for sensor development services  partially offset by a decrease in payments received from hella kg 
costs of revenue with the mdl acquisition  we have significantly increased our software consulting and maintenance revenue and the costs associated with these revenue streams 
starting we reclassified certain operating expenses related to software consulting and software and hardware maintenance as cost of service revenue 
we also reclassified certain operating expenses to costs of revenue related to amortization expenses of intangible assets arising from business combinations that were related to software licensed or product sold 
costs associated with providing collaborative research services are included with research and development expenses 

table of contents cost of products sold in was million or of product sales revenue  compared to million  or of product sales revenue in  and million  or of product sales revenue in the increase in the total cost of products sold in and was due to the change in product mix and the increase of products sold 
cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales revenue in was lower compared to other years due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years  and the development costs related to prototypes sold being expensed in prior periods as development costs  as discussed below 
the majority of symyx tools are built to order or to particular specifications 
we generally charge the development costs incurred prior to the commercial production of these systems to research and development expenses  resulting in a lower cost of products sold and a higher margin for these systems 
therefore  the cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to variability of product mix 
the cost of products sold may also be affected by adjustments to the warranty expense accrual for pre existing sales 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period when such a determination is made 
operating expenses amount in s as a percentage of total revenue change over previous year amount in s as a percentage of total revenue change over previous year amount in s as a percentage of total revenue research and development sales  general and administrative acquired in process research and development amortization of intangible assets arising from business combinations total operating expenses less than research and development r d expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom we conducted research and development  together with the date upon which the current contract ends and the primary focus of the collaborations 

table of contents partner current research contract ends primary focus of current collaborative efforts dow polyolefin catalysts for certain commodity chemicals exxonmobil catalysts for certain commodity chemicals including olefins we do not track our fully burdened r d costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  based on hours spent on each project  we estimate the r d efforts were allocated as follows projects funded by collaboration partners projects funded internally software development research tools development total we expect the percentage of our r d efforts funded by collaborative partners to continue to decline in as our main collaborative agreement with exxonmobil expires mid year 
we also expect our investments in software and tools development and internal research to increase on a percentage basis in the near term as mdl s expenses are reflected for the full year in fiscal and we continue to invest in new tools solutions and new internal research projects 
the increase of r d expenses in resulted primarily from approximately million in additional salary related expenses and consulting fees for mdl group companies 
the increase of r d expenses in was driven primarily by the increases in salary related expenses due to the hiring of additional scientific and technical staff to work on r d projects for exxonmobil and dow and increased headcount to develop our software platform 
r d expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in personnel related expense without a compensating revenue increase 
this increase in r d expenses as a percentage of total revenue was partially attributable to the requirement to write down the mdl deferred revenue at acquisition to the fair value of costs to perform the obligation 
r d expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased in compared to primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense 
as we strive to grow our symyx software  symyx tools and symyx research businesses  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to r d  and thus that our r d expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales  general and administrative sg a expenses our sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales  business development  legal  general management  finance and human resources  including stock based compensation expenses totaling million and million  respectively  in and  as well as payments of commissions to our sales agents and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
the increase in sg a expenses in was due to the mdl acquisition and to the increased personnel costs associated with our expanded sales and marketing organizations and the reorganization of our management team 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation and an increase in personnel costs 
we have increased our sg a expenses generally to invest in sales and marketing initiatives necessary to achieve growth across our businesses and to address the financial  legal  compliance and other complexities of operating multiple business lines 
however  we believe our infrastructure can now support near to mid term growth opportunities without comparable further increases in these expenses 
sg a expenses represented  and of total revenue for years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to was primarily due to the fact that we could not recognize certain acquisition related mdl deferred revenue under us generally accepted accounting principles to compensate for the increase in personnel costs 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense in going forward  we expect sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue will decrease as we believe our revenue will grow faster than sg a expenses

the total amortization of intangible assets in each of these years was recorded partially as costs of revenue and partially as operating expenses depending on the nature of these intangible assets

liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had negative cash flow from operating activities and positive cash flows from investing and financing activities for the year ended december  we ended fiscal year with cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million 
this compared to cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million at december  during  we used a net of million to acquire mdl  million for income taxes and approximately million for restructuring charges  while receiving million from the sale of our equity interest in ilypsa 

table of contents our operating activities used million of cash in and provided million and million of cash in and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of funding from research partners  payments from product sales and licensing fees 
in we paid approximately million in income taxes  of which the majority was related to the gain from the ilypsa transaction 
because this tax payment was recorded against operating cash flow while the original sales proceeds were recorded as investing cash flow  our cash flow from operating activities was negative for we currently expect that our operating cash flow for will be approximately neutral  and that our operating cash flow will fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  reflecting the seasonality of our businesses 
depending on the timing of tools deliveries and customer payments  we may experience negative cash flows from operating activities in certain periods 
as a result of adopting sfas r   and million of excess tax benefits for the years ended december  and  respectively  have been classified as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow 
net cash from investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively  in and included in the cash used in investing activities were net cash payments for mdl acquisition of million 
included in the cash used in investing activities were million for long term investments in intermolecular and visyx and a net of million for the acquisition of autodose 
included in the cash used in investing activities was the million net cash paid for the acquisition of synthematix 
during and  the majority of proceeds from the maturities of available for sale securities was re invested in available for sale securities 
the other fluctuations from period to period were due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales  and maturity of our available for sale securities 
cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment was million  million and million  respectively  in  and the increase of cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment in was primarily associated with the build out of an additional leased facility 
we believe that we have built out sufficient facilities spaces for our current business needs  but believe we may incur additional one time charges in facilities consolidation and reconfiguration in the near term to address the ongoing evolution of our businesses 
financing activities provided  and million of cash in and  respectively  and used million of cash in the cash inflows were primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee share purchase plan in each of the three years and for  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash outflows from financing activities in included approximately million payment of employee withholding tax in lieu of issuing common stock upon the vest of restricted stock units 
cash outflows in consisted of million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
our accounts receivable balance at december  increased significantly compared to december  due to the acquisition of mdl 
current liabilities increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  due to the expansion of our operations in  especially after the mdl acquisition 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  our bank credit facility  and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next twelve months 
nonetheless  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot provide assurance that additional funding  if sought  will be available or be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants which may restrict our business 
collaborative arrangements and licensing may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed  or on terms favorable to us  may harm our business and operating results 
principal commitments our principal commitments consist of our obligations under operating leases  our commitments to purchase inventory and fixed assets  and our commitments and services for royalty payments 
as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
the increase in our principal commitments was due partially to lease commitments associated with the mdl acquisition and partially associated with the january lease extension for one of our facilities in sunnyvale  california  until november we expect to satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next eight years 

table of contents future principal commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years facility commitments purchase commitments royalty commitments collaboration commitments total other commitments as of december   we carried a million accrued liability associated with uncertainties in income taxes 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods of any cash settlement with the respective tax authorities but have recorded the liability as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
customer indemnification from time to time  we agree to indemnify our customers against certain third party liabilities  including liability if our products infringe third party intellectual property rights 
such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the indemnification is typically limited to no more than the amount paid by the customer 
as of december   we were not subject to any pending intellectual property related litigation 
contingencies as discussed in the note of notes to consolidated financial statements  additional purchase price consideration of up to  may be payable upon the achievement of certain and revenue targets by our autodose product line 
we will evaluate the possibility of achieving these targets from time to time and record the fair value of any additional consideration as an additional cost of the acquisition 
no additional consideration was recorded as of december insurance we carry insurance with coverage and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  our management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities as of december  we have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 

table of contents dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock 
we currently expect to retain future earnings  if any  to support the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and available for sale investments which have maturities of less than two years 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
at december  our investment portfolio was comprised of approximately million in money market funds and million in us corporate debt instruments 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the impact on the fair value of our portfolio would be insignificant 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity in thousands average interest rate mature in fair value as of december  available for sale securities average interest rate
