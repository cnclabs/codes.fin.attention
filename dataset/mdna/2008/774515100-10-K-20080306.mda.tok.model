liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have been our income from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and other indebtedness 
in january  we incurred additional indebtedness to fund our acquisition of ej footwear as described below 
over the last several years our principal uses of cash have been for our acquisition of ej footwear as well as for working capital and capital expenditures to support our growth 
our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables and inventory  offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal business cycle and business expansion and is generally lowest in the months of january through march of each year and highest during the months of may through october of each year 

table of contents we typically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital requirements 
as a result  balances on our revolving credit facility will fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
our working capital increased to million at december   compared to million at the end of the prior year 
our capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our corporate offices  property  merchandising fixtures  molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology

in conjunction with the completion of our acquisition of ej footwear  we entered into agreements with gmac commercial finance gmac  and with american capital financial services  inc  as agent  and american capital strategies  ltd  as lender collectively  acas  for credit facilities totaling million 
the credit facilities were used to fund the acquisition of ej footwear 
under the terms of the agreements  the interest rates and repayment terms were a five year million revolving credit facility with gmac with an interest rate of libor plus or prime plus at our option weighted average of at december   an million term loan with gmac with an interest rate of libor plus or prime plus at our option weighted average of at december   payable in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in  and a million term loan with acas with an interest rate of libor plus  payable in equal installments from through the total amount available on our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of accounts receivable and inventory

principal repayment is due at maturity in may the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down the gmac commercial finance gmac term loans which totaled approximately million and the million american capital strategies  ltd acas term loan

the note purchase agreement is secured by a security interest in our assets and is subordinate to the security interest under the gmac line of credit 
the total amount available on our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had million in borrowings under this facility and total capacity of million 
our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants  which among other things  require us to maintain certain minimum ebitda and certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december   we had no retained earnings available for dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
we believe that our existing credit facilities coupled with cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our continued liquidity  however  is contingent upon future operating performance  cash flows and our ability to meet financial covenants under our credit facilities

at december   no such losses existed 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies

we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
additionally  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
inflation our financial performance is influenced by factors such as higher raw material costs as well as higher salaries and employee benefits 
management attempts to minimize or offset the effects of inflation through increased selling prices  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
we were able to mitigate the effects of inflation during due to these factors 
it is anticipated that inflationary pressures during will be offset through increases in sales and profitability  due to improved operating leverage in our business 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our management regularly reviews our accounting policies to make certain they are current and also provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
these include  but are not limited to  matters related to accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles  pension benefits and income taxes 
implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable 
this may include judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue principally consists of sales to customers  and  to a lesser extent  license fees 
revenue is recognized when the risk and title passes to the customer  while license fees are recognized when earned 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
sales returns and allowances we record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances 
these reductions are influenced by historical experience  based on customer returns and allowances 
the actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that sales returns or allowances should be either increased or decreased  then the adjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such a determination is made 
sales returns and allowances for sales returns were approximately and of sales for and  respectively 
inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of our inventories are considered saleable and we have been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories at amounts above cost through our factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers 
should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow moving or obsolete inventories  additional provisions may be necessary 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required 
as of december   management was pursuing reimbursement from the us military for costs associated with raw material purchases of million 
these raw material purchases were made exclusively for production under a subcontract for the us military 
subsequent to the purchase of raw materials  the subcontract was cancelled for convenience by the us military 
in march  we received a partial settlement and finalized the ultimate settlement of the contract in june as a result of this settlement and other third party sales  the value of the raw material inventory was realized 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets  including goodwill  trademarks and patents are reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently  if necessary 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and our eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
other assumptions include discount rates  royalty rates  cost of capital  and market multiples 
we perform such testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we compare the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying value of the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 
fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow and guideline company methods 
pension benefits accounting for pensions involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements for information on our plan and the assumptions used 
pension expenses are determined by actuaries using assumptions concerning the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
an actuarial analysis of benefit obligations and plan assets is determined as of september each year 
the funded status of our plan and reconciliation of accrued pension cost is determined annually as of december actual results would be different using other assumptions 
on december  we froze the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all non us territorial employees 
as a result of freezing the plan  we recognized a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of for previously unrecognized service costs 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying plan assets could result in losses or a higher accrual 
income taxes management has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets for a portion of state and local income tax net operating losses that it believes may not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   approximately million of undistributed earnings remains that would become taxable upon repatriation to the united states 
recently issued financial accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf position eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation eitf  which addresses disclosure requirements for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes
