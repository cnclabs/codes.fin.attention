 accounting for reverse spin offs 
accordingly  we were considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting successor to skyterra for financial reporting purposes 
this accounting is required because  among other things  i the businesses transferred to us generated all of skyterra s historical consolidated revenues and constitute a majority of the book value of skyterra s assets immediately preceding the distribution and ii the businesses transferred to us include skyterra s discontinued operating subsidiaries and all of the assets and liabilities relating to such subsidiaries 
our historical results through december  are those previously reported by skyterra  including the results attributable to the businesses and assets retained by skyterra  in accordance with eitf accordingly  future reports will continue to reflect hns historical results through december  under the equity method and will also reflect the historical results through the date of the distribution attributable to mobile satellite ventures lp and other assets and liabilities retained by skyterra

as a result of the january transaction  as described below  our business has changed materially 
for the periods following the january transaction  we include the financial position and operating results of hughes network systems  llc hns  our wholly owned subsidiary  in our consolidated financial statements 
for the periods prior to the january transaction  the company s results are derived from the audited financial statements of skyterra communications  inc skyterra  including the results of the business and assets retained by skyterra through february   the date of the distribution  as described below 
from april  the date of the april transaction  as described below through december   we recorded our investment in hns using the equity method of accounting 
overview hughes communications  inc hci  the company  we  us  and our operates its business primarily through hns  our wholly owned subsidiary  a telecommunications company 
we are the world s leading provider of broadband satellite network services and systems to the enterprise market 
we are also the largest satellite internet access provider to north american consumers and small and medium sized businesses  such as small office and home office users  which we refer to as the consumer market 
in addition  we provide managed services to large enterprises that combine the use of satellite and terrestrial alternatives  thus offering solutions that are tailored and cost optimized to the specific customer requirements 
we operate in four business segments the north america very small aperture terminals vsat segment  the international vsat segment  the telecom systems segment and the corporate and other segment 
the north america vsat segment consists of the consumer group and the network equipment and services group 
the international vsat segment consists of the network equipment and services group 
the telecom systems segment consists of the mobile satellite systems group  including development services and equipment provided to a related party  hughes telematics  inc hti  and the terrestrial microwave group 
the corporate and other segment consists of various minority investments held by the company  our corporate offices and assets not specifically related to another business segment 
due to the complementary nature and common architecture of our services and products across our business groups  we are able to leverage our expertise and resources within our various operating units to yield significant cost efficiencies 
this report includes the annual report form k of hns as exhibit as we believe that these are meaningful disclosures since prior to the january transaction  our results of operations did not reflect hns results of operations on a consolidated basis  and hns represents our principal business 
significant transactions through a series of transactions from to  we acquired the businesses that we owned as of december  an overview of those transactions is as follows on april   skyterra communications  inc skyterra acquired of hns class a membership interests the april transaction from dtv network inc dtv networks  a wholly owned subsidiary of directv group  inc directv 
the acquisition occurred pursuant to an agreement among skyterra  directv  dtv networks and hns  dated december   as amended 
on december   pursuant to a separation agreement between us and skyterra the separation agreement  see discussion under separation agreement  skyterra contributed to us its ownership of hns membership interest  among other things  and we became hns managing member  on october   we acquired series a preferred shares of hughes systique corporation for million 
on december   pursuant to the separation agreement  skyterra contributed to us the following its ownership of hns voting  or class a  membership interests  its interests in electronic system products  inc esp  formerly a product development and engineering services firm  now focused on maximizing the license revenues from its existing intellectual property portfolio  its interests in afrihub llc afrihub  a discontinued business  its interests in certain minority investments in navigauge  inc  miraxis  llc  a discontinued business  mainstream data  inc  edmunds holdings  inc and data synapse  inc  and cash and short term investments 
on january   we completed our purchase of the remaining of hns class a membership interests for million in cash the january transaction pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement we entered into with directv on november  to finance the purchase  we borrowed million from certain of skyterra s controlling stockholders  various investment vehicles that are affiliated with apollo management  lp together with its affiliates  apollo 
the loan was repaid in march following the completion of the rights offering conducted by us 
as a result of the january transaction  we own of hns the class a membership interests  and our consolidated financial statements for periods beginning on or after january  include the results of hns and its controlled  majority owned subsidiaries 
on february   skyterra distributed all of our outstanding common stock to skyterra s common  non voting common and preferred stockholders and its series a and a warrant holders the distribution 
as the result  skyterra was separated into two publicly traded companies skyterra and hci 
following the distribution  skyterra no longer owns any of our capital stock  however  skyterra s controlling stockholder at the time of the distribution  apollo  became our controlling stockholder 
following the distribution  skyterra retained its interest in its other assets  including cash and investments 
notwithstanding the legal form of the distribution  the distribution was accounted for as a reverse spin off in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for reverse spin offs 
accordingly  the company was considered the divesting entity and was treated as the accounting successor to skyterra for financial reporting purposes and skyterra was treated as if it had been distributed by the company 
this treatment was required because  among other things  i the businesses transferred to the company generated all of skyterra s historical consolidated revenues and constituted a majority of the book value of skyterra s assets immediately preceding the distribution and ii the businesses transferred to the company included skyterra s discontinued operating subsidiaries and all of the assets and liabilities relating to such subsidiaries 
accordingly  the company s results through december  are those previously reported by skyterra  including the results of the business and assets retained by skyterra in accordance with eitf the company s results for periods beginning on or after january   the date on which the company completed the january transaction  included the results of the business and assets retained by skyterra through the distribution data and reflected hns results of operations 
on march   we closed our rights offering  pursuant to which we issued  shares of our common stock to our stockholders at a subscription price of per share 
in connection with the rights offering  we received proceeds of million  of which million was received from the apollo stockholders 
the proceeds of the rights offering were used to repay the short term debt financing obtained from the apollo stockholders 
distribution on february   skyterra completed the distribution and separated into two publicly traded companies i hughes communications  inc  which consists of  among other things  the assets  liabilities and operations associated with hns and esp and certain minority investments in entities including mainstream data  inc  edmunds holdings  inc  data synapse  inc and hughes systique  along with all of skyterra s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding million  and certain other liabilities expressly allocated from skyterra and ii skyterra  which consists of the assets and liabilities associated with skyterra s interest in mobile satellite ventures lp msv and skyterra s stake in terrestar networks  inc terrestar networks  million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the obligations pursuant to skyterra s series a preferred stock 
to effect the distribution  skyterra distributed to each of its stockholders one half of one share of our common stock for each share of skyterra common stock or  in the case of holders of skyterra preferred stock and series a and a warrants  in accordance with their terms  one half of one share of our common stock for each share of skyterra common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of such preferred stock and warrants 
pursuant to skyterra s long term incentive plan  the compensation committee of skyterra s board of directors is required to make an equitable adjustment to the terms of options issued under that plan in the event a special  large and nonrecurring dividend or distribution affects skyterra s common stock such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of the participants under such plan 
skyterra s compensation committee has discretion to make such an adjustment to any option issued under the plan by adjusting the number and kind of shares that may be issued in respect of outstanding options or the exercise price relating to such options 
pursuant to this provision  skyterra s compensation committee determined that holders of stock options issued under the plan who were current members of skyterra s management and board of directors  as well as a consultant and former directors who were involved with the acquisition of hns  should receive an option to purchase one share of our common stock for each option to purchase two shares of skyterra s common stock that they held as of the date of the distribution 
the issuance of such options to purchase our common stock was in lieu of a larger adjustment to the exercise price of skyterra s options that such holders would have been otherwise entitled had they not received options to purchase our common stock 
a reduction in the exercise price or in some cases  an increase in the number of shares was the manner in which all of skyterra s other options outstanding under the plan were adjusted 
on february   options to purchase  shares of our common stock were issued to holders of skyterra options 
separation agreement we have entered into the separation agreement with skyterra effective december   which affected the transfer  by way of contribution from skyterra to us  of the assets related to our business  and the assumption by us of certain liabilities 
the separation agreement and certain related agreements govern  among other things  certain of the ongoing relations between us and skyterra following the distribution 
in general  pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement  all of skyterra s assets and liabilities  other than those specifically relating to msv and terrestar networks  million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and the obligations pursuant to skyterra s series a preferred stock  became our assets and liabilities 
the separation agreement also provides for assumptions of liabilities and cross indemnities designed to allocate generally  effective as of the date of the separation agreement  financial responsibility for all liabilities arising out of or in connection with our businesses to us and all liabilities arising out of or in connection with skyterra s interest in msv and terrestar networks to skyterra 
in addition  we will indemnify skyterra for liabilities relating to certain litigation in which skyterra or skyterra s subsidiaries were involved 
furthermore  the company has a tax sharing agreement with skyterra that governs the allocation of tax liabilities and related tax matters  such as the preparation and filing of tax returns and tax contests  between the company and skyterra for all taxable periods ended or on the distribution date 
strategic initiatives and their impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and  we generated a net income of million  a net loss of million and a net income of million  respectively 
we expect our long term results of operations to improve over time as we continue to focus our investments in technology  further develop and expand our consumer group and commence operations of our spaceway network 
technology we have incorporated advances in semiconductor technology to increase the functionality and reliability of our vsats and reduce manufacturing costs 
in addition  through the usage of advanced spectrally efficient modulation and coding methodologies  such as dvb s  and proprietary software web acceleration and compression techniques  we continue to improve the efficiency of our transponder capacity and invest in our research and development efforts to maintain our position as a leader in vsat technology 
consumer group we have made significant investments in our consumer group as we believe there is a large segment of this market that is underserved by terrestrial alternatives such as digital subscriber line dsl and cable 
we continue to review and adjust pricing policies relative to other competitive offerings in the marketplace in connection with our consumer hardware and service offerings 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs  including purchases of transponder capacity and subscriber acquisition costs  related to hardware and associated marketing costs 
at december   we had a consumer customer base of approximately  subscribers that generated revenues of million 
spaceway as part of our focus on less costly and more efficient technological solutions  we successfully launched our spaceway tm satellite spaceway on august  and plan to introduce service in north america on the spaceway network in the first quarter of we anticipate that spaceway will expand our business significantly by increasing our addressable market in the enterprise and consumer markets and allow us to offer our customers faster communication rates 
in addition  we expect to reduce our operating costs in the future  substantially through the reduction of third party transponder capacity expenses 
however  we will incur startup costs associated with the launch and operation of spaceway until we acquire a sufficient number of customers 
acquisitions  strategic alliances and divestitures we continue to focus on expanding the identified markets for our products  services  and network solutions in the north america vsat  international vsat and telecom systems segments 
consistent with this strategy to grow the company and improve our financial position  we also review our competitive position on an ongoing basis and  from time to time  consider various acquisitions  strategic alliances  and divestitures  which we believe would be beneficial to our business 
on february   the company completed the acquisition of helius for up to million as the result of the merger agreement the company entered into on december  the merger agreement with helius  utah acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company merger sub and the canopy group  inc and canopy ventures i  lp  the primary shareholders of helius the canopy entities 
in february  subsequent to the acquisition  the company transferred its ownership of helius to hns 
helius will operate within our north america vsat segment  due to the nature of its business activities  its customer base and similarities with the north america enterprise business 
for further discussion of this acquisition  see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
marketing brand name in connection with the april transaction  the rights to the direcway brand name and any related trademark rights were retained by directv 
as a result  we launched our new brand name  hughesnet  in april and have completed the transition from direcway to hughesnet 
the total cost of introducing and implementing the new brand name was approximately million 
broadband market focus in  our results of operations were negatively impacted by our decision to shift our primary focus exclusively to the broadband market 
accordingly  we evaluated the narrowband products in our inventory and recorded a charge in the second quarter of of million for excess or obsolete inventories to reduce net book value of the narrowband products to their net realizable value  and substantially all of these products were disposed of during this charge was included in cost of hardware products sold and primarily related to the north america vsat segment 
key business metrics business segments we divide our operations into four distinct segments the north america vsat segment  the international vsat segment  the telecom systems segment and the corporate and other 
within the north america vsat segment  sales can be attributed to the consumer group and the network equipment and services group 
within the international vsat segment  sales can be attributed to the network equipment and services group 
our telecom systems segment sales can be attributed to the mobile satellite systems group  including development services and equipment provided to hti and the terrestrial microwave group 
the corporate and other segment consists of various minority investments held by the company  our corporate offices and assets not specifically related to another business segment 
due to the complementary nature and common architecture of our services and products across our business lines  we are able to leverage our expertise and resources within our various operating units to yield significant cost efficiencies 
revenues we generate revenues from the sale and financing of hardware and the provision of services 
in our north america and international vsat segments  we generate revenues from both services and hardware  while in our telecom systems segment  we generate revenues primarily from the sale of hardware 
some of our large enterprise vsat customers  who purchase equipment separately  operate their own networks 
these customers include large enterprises  incumbent local exchange carriers  governmental agencies and resellers 
contracts for our vsat services vary in length depending on the customer s requirements 
services our services revenue is varied in nature and includes total turnkey communications services  terminal relocation  maintenance and changes  transponder capacity and multicast or broadcast services 
our services are offered on a contractual basis  which vary in length based on a particular end market 
typically  our large enterprise customers enter into a service contract with a two to five year duration and our consumer customers enter into a to month contract 
we bill and recognize service revenues on a monthly per site basis 
beginning in may  we began to offer only months contracts to our consumer customers 
for enterprise customers who receive services from our network operation  our services include the following service type description broadband connectivity provide basic transport  intranet connectivity services and internet service provider services applications include high speed internet access  ip vpn  multicast file delivery and streaming  point of sale credit transaction  enterprise back office communications  and satellite backup for frame relay service and other terrestrial networks managed network services provide one stop turnkey suite of bundled services that include terrestrial and satellite networks include network design program management  installation management  network and application engineering services  proactive network management  network operations  field maintenance and customer care isp services and hosted application provide internet connectivity and hosted customer owned and managed applications on our network facilities provide the customer application services developed by us or in conjunction with our service partners include internet access  e mail services  web hosting and online payments digital media services digital content management and delivery including video  online learning and digital signage applications customized business solutions provide customized  industry specific enterprise solutions that can be applied to multiple businesses in a given industry our services to enterprise customers are negotiated on a contract by contract basis with price varying based on numerous factors  including number of sites  complexity of system and scope of services provided 
we have the ability to integrate these service offerings to provide comprehensive solutions for our customers 
we also provide managed services to our customers who operate their own dedicated network facilities and charge them a management fee for the operation and support of their networks 
hardware we offer our enterprise customers the option to purchase their equipment up front or include the equipment purchased in a service agreement under which payments are made over a fixed term 
for our consumer customers  they can either purchase their equipment up front or pay for it under a service contract over a period of to months 
beginning in may  we began to offer only months contracts to our consumer customers 
the north american and international network equipment and services groups hardware revenues are derived from network operating centers  radio frequency terminals earth stations  vsat  components including indoor units  outdoor units  antennas  voice  video  serial data appliances and system integration services to integrate all of the above into a system 
we also provide specialized equipment to our mobile satellite systems and terrestrial microwave customers 
through large multi year contracts  we develop and supply turnkey networking and terminal systems for various operators who offer mobile satellite based or telematics voice and data services 
we also supply microwave based networking equipment to mobile operators for back hauling their data from cellular telephone sites to their switching centers 
in addition  local exchange carriers  use our equipment for broadband access traffic from corporations bypassing local phone companies 
the size and scope of these projects vary from year to year and do not follow a pattern that can be reasonably predicted 
market trends impacting our revenues we operate our business primarily through hns 
for the year ended december   our results are derived from skyterra s audited financial statements 
we believe it is meaningful that the market trends impacting our revenues include only information for the years ended december  and as our results of operations did not reflected hns results on a consolidated basis prior to the january transaction 
the following table presents our revenues by end market for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  variance amount revenues services hardware sales total revenues revenues by segments north america vsat consumer network equipment and services total north america vsat international vsat network equipment and services telecom systems mobile satellite systems terrestrial microwave total telecom systems corporate and other total revenues revenue from our consumer group increased by for the year ended december  compared to the same period in at december   our consumer subscriber base grew by  subscribers to  subscribers compared to december  during  we averaged approximately  gross customer additions per month and experienced an average churn rate the rate of customer cancellations non renewals as a percentage of total number of subscribers of 
the average revenue per unit arpu for the year ended december  increased by to compared to the same period in the growth in our consumer group has been driven primarily by three factors i our focus on new market distribution channels for geographic areas that have historically been underserved by dsl and cable  ii targeted service plans aimed at consumer customers broadband access needs  and iii enhancement in the performance capabilities of our service offerings 
the consumer market is very competitive  and we expect to continue to experience pricing pressure on our hardware offerings 
revenue from our north american network equipment and services group for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to same period in we expect future revenue growth will be driven by an increase in sales of equipment and services when our spaceway satellite is placed in service 
revenue from our international network equipment and services group for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of growth in business at our foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  in response to increasingly complex customer requirements  we have begun to include both terrestrial solutions  such as dsl  as well as traditional satellite solutions in our managed network service offerings 
revenue from our mobile satellite systems group for the year ended december  grew by to million compared to the same period in contributing to this growth was increased engineering efforts on new projects involving automotive telematics solutions and the development of ground based beam forming technology which allows sharing of bandwidth between terrestrial and satellite applications as well as expansion projects for our legacy customers 
we expect that our mobile satellite systems group revenues will continue to fluctuate quarterly due to the nature of these projects 
we continue to actively pursue a number of opportunities in the area of hybrid satellite terrestrial mobile networks and automotive telematics solutions 
we believe this is the growth area of the mobile satellite industry that provides the company with opportunities to expand our mobile satellite systems group 
revenue from our terrestrial microwave group for the year ended december  decreased by to million compared to the same period in  due to the completion of major mobility and maintenance projects in and delays in the rollout of new systems in we anticipate that revenues of this business will fluctuate quarterly as we pursue revenue opportunities through sales of point to multipoint equipment to international mobile and fixed operators for backhauling their cellular telephone sites and ethernet networks to their switching centers 
revenue backlog at december  and  our total revenue backlog  which we define as our expected future revenue under customer contracts that are non cancelable and excluding consumer customers  was million and million  respectively 
we expect to realize our revenue backlog as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
see item a 
risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the potential risks to our revenue and backlog 
although we have historically signed contracts with our consumer customers for to months  we do not include these contractual commitments in our backlog 
beginning in may  we began to offer only months contracts to our consumer customers 
cost of services our cost of services relate to the costs associated with the provision of managed network services  which primarily consist of transponder capacity leases  hub infrastructure  customer care  terrestrial capacity  depreciation expense related to network infrastructure  and the salaries and related employment costs for those employees who manage our network operations and other project areas 
these costs  except for transponder capacity leases and customer care costs which are dependent on the number of customers served  have remained relatively constant during and despite the increasing traffic on our network  because we were able to consolidate certain components of our network to contain costs 
in addition  the migration to a single upgraded platform for our north america vsat segment has enabled us to leverage our satellite bandwidth and network operation facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies 
in recent years  transponder capacity has not been a limiting factor in growing the vsat service business 
transponder capacity is typically sold under long term contracts by fixed satellite service fss providers  and we are continually evaluating the need to secure additional capacity with sufficient lead time to permit us to provide reliable service to our customers 
cost of hardware products sold we outsource a significant portion of the manufacturing of our hardware for our north america and international vsat and telecom systems segments to third party contract manufacturers 
our cost of hardware relates primarily to direct materials and subsystems eg  antennas  salaries and related employment costs for those employees who are directly associated with the procurement and manufacture of our products and other items of indirect overhead incurred in the procurement and production process 
cost of hardware products sold also includes certain engineering and hardware costs related to the design of a particular product for specific customer programs 
in addition  certain software development costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and amortized to cost of hardware products sold over their estimated useful lives  not to exceed five years 
with respect to the vsat operating leases assigned to financial institutions in which we retain a continuing obligation  cost of hardware products sold includes depreciation of the installed equipment under the vsat operating leases over the life of the lease 
under the terms of new operating lease arrangements in which we do not have a continuing obligation to perform  the cost of hardware products sold per unit of equipment sold will initially be higher compared to the operating lease arrangement in which we do have a continuing obligation to perform because we recognize the entire cost of products sold upon the transfer of title instead of depreciating the cost over the term of the contract 
as we have developed new product offerings  we have reduced product costs due to higher levels of component integration  design improvements and volume increases 
subscriber acquisition costs sac are associated with our consumer group and are comprised of three elements i the subsidy for the cost of hardware and related installation  ii sales and marketing expense  and iii dealer and customer service representative commissions on new installations activations 
the subsidy for cost of hardware and related cost of installation is deferred and amortized over the initial contract period as a component of cost of hardware products sold 
the portion of sac related to sales and marketing is expensed as incurred 
dealer and customer service representative commissions are deferred and amortized over the initial contract period as a component of sales and marketing expense 
customer equipment financing arrangements in connection with the sale of vsat hardware to certain north american network equipment and services customers who do not purchase their equipment outright  we enter into long term operating leases  generally for two to five years  with the customer for use of the vsat hardware installed at the customer s facilities 
prior to the fourth quarter of  hns had an arrangement with a third party financial institution to borrow against the future operating lease revenues at the inception of the lease 
when amounts were borrowed under these arrangements  the financial institution assumed the credit risk associated with non payment by the customer for the duration of the operating lease  however  hns retained a continuing obligation to indemnify the financing institution from losses it may incur up to the original value of the hardware from non performance of its system a non performance event 
as a result  hns did not recognize a sale of the equipment at the time of such transactions since hns retained a continuing obligation to perform under those leases 
in connection with these transactions  the financial institution receives title to the equipment at the inception of the lease and obtains the residual rights to the equipment after the operating lease with the customer has expired 
since the inception of the borrowing program in  hns has received nominal claims from customers for non performance events and has not been required to make any indemnification payments for a non performance event 
hns does not maintain a reserve for non performance events as it believes the possibility of the occurrence of a non performance event due to a service outage is remote given its ability to quickly re establish customer service at a relatively nominal cost 
upon entering into these leases for which hns had a continuing obligation to perform  hns received cash from the financial institution for a substantial portion of the aggregate future lease rental payments to be received from the customers for the installed equipment used to provide services to the customers 
at such time  hns recognized a liability to the financial institution  which hns refers to as vsat hardware financing reflected in its financial statements as debt 
the amount of the debt recorded initially is the proceeds received from the financial institution  which is equivalent to the selling price of the installed equipment used to provide services to the customer 
hns records interest expense on a month to month basis relating to the vsat hardware financing and structures these lease arrangements such that amounts hns receives from its customers under their customer service agreements provide hns with the necessary funds to pay principal and interest obligations owed under the vsat hardware financing liability 
accordingly  as hns recognizes revenue from its customers under their contracts  it also records interest expense and a reduction of the vsat hardware financing liability as payments are made to the financing institution 
revenues from the associated customer service contracts are recorded as they are earned on a month to month basis over the life of the contract  not at inception of the lease 
upon entering into these leases for which hns have had a continuing performance obligation  hns capitalized the book value of the installed equipment used to provide services to the customers as vsat operating lease hardware and depreciate these costs over the term of the customer service agreement 
this depreciation of the vsat operating lease hardware is reflected in cost of hardware products sold and is recorded over the period of the lease generally the same as the life of the customer service contract 
in september  hns entered into a new lease financing arrangement  under which it does not have a continuing obligation subject to a non performance event  with the third party financial institution 
under the new arrangement  hns receives cash from the financial institution and record a sale and cost of hardware products sold upon transfer of title to the financial institution 
accordingly  since there is no continuing involvement  hns records revenue upon the transfer of title instead of on a monthly basis over the term of the operating lease and expenses the cost of the hardware as an element of cost of hardware products sold  rather than capitalize it 
during and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of hardware sales under the terms of the new arrangement 
in situations where hns leases its vsat hardware to the customer instead of selling to the customer outright  hns expects to primarily offer leases without a continuing obligation to the financial institution 
however  results of future periods will also be impacted by the accounting treatment for leases in which hns has a continuing obligation to perform until those contracts expire 
as noted above  the accounting treatment for these transactions will be different for our customer equipment sales depending on whether it does or does not have a continuing performance obligation under the associated equipment financing lease 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses primarily consist of the salaries  commissions  related benefit costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff  advertising  travel  allocation of facilities  and other directly related overhead costs for our domestic and international businesses 
general and administrative expenses include bad debt expense and salaries and related employee benefits for employees associated with common supporting functions  such as accounting and finance  risk management  legal  information technology  administration  human resources  and senior management 
selling  general  and administrative costs also include facilities costs  third party service providers costs such as outside tax and legal counsel  and insurance providers and depreciation of fixed assets 
research and development r d r d expenses primarily consist of the salaries of certain members of our engineering staff plus an applied overhead charge 
r d expenses also include engineering support for existing platforms and development efforts to build new products and software applications  subcontractors  material purchases and other direct costs in support of product development 
selected segment data our operations are comprised of four segments i the north america vsat segment  which consists of the consumer group and the network equipment and services group  ii the international vsat segment  which consists of the network equipment and services group  iii the telecom systems segment  which consists of the mobile satellite systems group and the terrestrial microwave group  and iv the corporate and other segment which consists of esp s business  various minority investments held by the company as well as our corporate offices and assets not specifically related to another business segment 
the following tables set forth our revenues and operating income loss for our primary segments in thousands year ended december  vs

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december variance dollars in thousands amount services hardware sales total revenues of revenue to total revenues services hardware sales services revenues our services revenue is primarily generated by our north america vsat segment 
the growth in services revenues was attributable to a revenue increase in the consumer group of million to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of increases in the subscriber base 
at december   the total subscriber base increased by approximately  subscribers to approximately  subscribers compared to  at december  arpu increased by to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  in addition  services revenue from our international vsat segment increased by million to million in from million in  mainly resulting from higher revenues of i million from our brazil operations as the number of sites under service increased to approximately  as of december  from approximately  as of december   ii million from enterprise customers in india  and iii million from our european operations as a result of the launch of hughesnet managed network services in late and the commencement of services on a new  multi year contract for a large lottery operator in the united kingdom 
partially offsetting the increase in services revenue from our international vsat segment was a million reduction in us source services provided directly to our international customers

under the debt securities 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on november  when there is an offer to sell the securities  we will provide the specific terms of the securities 
any proceeds received from the sale of our securities offered pursuant to the registration statement will be used for the acquisition of a satellite or general corporate purposes 
pending expenditure of the net proceeds  we intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering of the securities received by us in investment grade and interest bearing securities 
based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets and industry  we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  research and development  ground infrastructure expenditures for spaceway  new acquisitions  including the subsequent acquisition of helius and additional investment in hughes systique  and initial milestone payments for development of a potential new satellite and  to a lesser extent  other on going capital and operating expenditures 
however  our ability to fund these needs and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  the level of spending by our customers and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
any future acquisitions  joint ventures  acquisition of a satellite  or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all

additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
commitments and contingencies for a discussion of commitments and contingencies  see note and note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is required to issue standby letters of credit and bonds primarily to support certain sales of its equipment to international government customers 
these letters of credit are either bid bonds to support contract bids  or to support advance payments made by customers upon contract execution and prior to equipment being shipped  or guarantees of performance issued in support of its warranty obligations 
bid bonds typically expire upon the issue of the award by the customer 
advance payment bonds expire upon receipt by the customer of equipment  and performance bonds typically expire when the warranty expires  generally one year after the installation of the equipment 
as of december   we had million of contractual obligations to customers and other statutory governmental agencies  which were secured by letters of credit issued through us and our subsidiaries credit facilities 
of this amount  million were issued under the revolving credit facility  of which million was issued to secure a bond to the federal communications commission  million was secured by restricted cash  million related to an insurance bond  and million were secured by letters of credit issued under credit arrangements available to our indian and brazilian subsidiaries 
certain of the letters of credit issued by our indian subsidiaries are secured by those entities assets 
seasonality like many communications infrastructure equipment vendors  a significant amount of our hardware sales occur in the second half of the year due to our customers annual procurement and budget cycles 
large enterprises and operators usually allocate their capital expenditure budgets at the beginning of their fiscal year which often coincides with the calendar year 
the typical sales cycle for large complex system procurements is to months  which often results in the customer expenditure occurring towards the end of the year 
customers often seek to expend the budgeted funds prior to the end of the year and the next budget cycle 
as a result  interim results are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full year 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain relationships and related transactions for a discussion of related party transactions  see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition service revenues and hardware sales  excluding lease revenues described below  are recognized when services are rendered or products are installed or shipped to third party installers and as title passes to those customers 
in situations where customer offerings represent a bundled arrangement for both services and hardware  revenue elements are separated into their relevant components services or hardware for revenue recognition purposes 
the company offers a rebate to qualifying new consumer subscribers and records a reduction in revenue in the same period the related sale occurs based on an estimate of the number of rebates that will be redeemed 
this estimate is based on historical experience and actual sales during the promotion 
prior to the third quarter of  hns leased certain vsat hardware under operating leases to customers which were funded by third party financial institutions 
under the terms of the arrangement  hns retained a financial obligation to the financial institution such leases  vsat leases 
under the vsat leases  hns received cash from the financial institution for a substantial portion of the aggregate lease rentals at the inception of the operating lease  and hns recognized a corresponding liability to the financial institution for those transactions 
hns capitalized the book value of the installed equipment used to provide services to the customer as vsat operating lease hardware and depreciated those costs over the term of the customer lease agreement 
hardware lease revenues for vsat leases were recognized over the term of the operating lease 
subsequent to the third quarter of  hns amended its arrangements with the financial institutions financing the vsat leases  and hns ceased to retain a continuing obligation to the financial institutions for any new transactions 
for such leases  hardware revenues are recognized at the inception of the transaction since there is no on going performance obligation 
in addition to providing standard product and service offerings  the company also enters into contracts to design  develop and deliver telecommunication networks to customers 
these contracts for telecommunication networks require significant effort to develop and construct the network  over an extended time period 
revenues are also earned from long term contracts for the sale of mobile satellite communications systems 
sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting 
under this method  sales are recorded equivalent to costs incurred plus a portion of the profit expected to be realized  determined based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
profits expected to be realized on long term contracts are based on estimates of total sales value and costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made 
estimated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
business combinations and intangible assets the company has participated in several significant transactions since april which have impacted the company s financial statements 
the company accounts for business combinations in accordance sfas no 
 business combinations 
the acquisition of businesses is an element of the company s strategy 
under the purchase method  the company is required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s financial statements 
intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations which have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on estimates of the period during which the assets are expected to generate revenue 
intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may no longer be recoverable 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining provisions for income taxes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and where applicable  record a valuation allowance to reduce the total deferred tax assets to amounts that will  more likely than not  be realized in the future 
our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence  including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted taxable income from operating activities 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment 
in the event that actual taxable income from operating activities differs from forecasted amounts  or if we change our estimates of forecasted taxable income from operating activities  we could record additional charges in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amounts 
such charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we also review our positions taken or that will be taken on the income tax returns for unrecognized tax benefits  assess whether such unrecognized tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold  and determine the need to record a fin liability along with any penalty and interest 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations  domestically and internationally 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our determination of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax assessments are probable and estimable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is less than we originally expected  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary
