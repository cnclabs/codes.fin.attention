general description of our operations as of december   we operated dealerships in metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
we developed our dealership portfolio through the acquisition of large  locally branded dealership groups operating throughout the united states 
we complemented these large dealership groups with the purchase of numerous single point dealerships and small dealership groups in our existing market areas referred to as tuck in acquisitions 
our retail network is currently organized into principally four regions and includes nine locally branded dealership groups 
the following is a detailed breakdown of our markets and dealerships as of december  brand names by region date of initial acquisition markets franchises south nalley automotive group september atlanta  ga acura  audi  bmw  chrysler  hino a  honda  ic bus  infiniti a  international a  isuzu truck  jaguar  jeep  lexus a  nissan  peterbilt  volvo  workhorse florida courtesy autogroup september tampa  fl chrysler  dodge  honda  hyundai  infiniti  jeep  kia  mercedes benz  nissan  toyota  volkswagen c coggin automotive group october jacksonville  fl buick  chevrolet  gmc a  honda a  kia a b  nissan a  pontiac a  toyota orlando  fl buick  chevrolet  ford  gmc  honda a  lincoln  mercury  pontiac fort pierce  fl acura  bmw  honda  mercedes benz west david mcdavid auto group april dallas fort worth  tx acura  honda a  lincoln  mercury houston  tx honda  nissan austin  tx acura

b represents pending divestitures as of december   which were sold in the first quarter of c represents pending divestitures as of december  new vehicle sales our franchises include a diverse portfolio of american  european and asian brands 
our new vehicle sales include the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new retail and the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet the terms new retail and fleet being collectively referred to as new 
in  we retailed  new vehicles through our dealerships 
new vehicle retail sales were of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  fleet sales  which provide significantly less gross margins than retail sales  were approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle retailed pvr 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on changes in consumer preferences as a result of our strong brand mix  which is heavily weighted towards mid line import and luxury brands 
please see business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification below for a discussion on our diverse offering of brands and products 
our new vehicle retail sales include new vehicle sales  new vehicle retail lease transactions provided by third parties and other similar agreements arranged by our individual dealerships 
as a result of finite lease terms  customers who lease new vehicles generally return to the market more frequently than customers who purchase new vehicles 
in addition  because third party lessors frequently give our dealerships the first option to purchase vehicles returned by customers at lease end  leases provide us with an additional source of late model vehicles for our used vehicle inventory 
generally  leased vehicles remain under factory warranty for the term of the lease  allowing dealerships to provide repair service to the lessee throughout the lease term 
used vehicle sales we sell used vehicles at all of our dealership locations 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used 
in  we retailed  used vehicles through our dealerships 
retail sales of used vehicles  which generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles  made up approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  used vehicle revenue from wholesale sales was of total revenue for the year ended december  profits from the sales of used vehicles depend primarily on the 
table of contents ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and the use of the best available technology to manage our inventory 
our new vehicle operations provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high quality trade ins and off lease vehicles  which we believe are good sources of attractive used vehicle inventory 
we purchase a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory at auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers offering off lease  rental and fleet vehicles and open auctions that offer vehicles sold by other dealers and repossessed vehicles 
used vehicle inventory is typically wholesaled after approximately days  except for used vehicles that do not fit within our inventory mix  which are wholesaled almost immediately 
the reconditioning of used vehicles also creates profitable service work for our fixed operations departments 
in addition to our high quality supply of used vehicles  we manage our used car sales on a local basis and employ the best available technology to manage our inventory and used car sales on a local basis 
we transfer used vehicles among our dealerships to provide a balanced mix of used vehicle inventory at each of our dealerships 
we believe that acquisitions of additional dealerships will expand the internal market for the transfer of used vehicles among our dealerships and  therefore  increase the ability of each dealership to offer a balanced mix of used vehicles 
we have taken several steps towards building customer confidence in our used vehicle inventory  including participation in manufacturer certification programs as well as the development of our own used vehicle certification program 
the manufacturer programs make certain used vehicles eligible for vehicle benefits such as special finance rates and extended manufacturer warranties 
our used vehicle certification program includes a thorough inspection of used vehicle inventory within the program and allows our customers to return used vehicles for any reason within five days or five hundred miles 
we guarantee the operation of the vehicle  subject to certain limitations  for sixty days from the date of purchase 
in addition  each dealership offers customers the opportunity to purchase extended warranties  which are provided by third parties  on used car sales 
over time  we intend to grow our used vehicle sales by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges and all classes of used vehicles  including factory certified as well as traditional non certified used vehicles providing competitive prices to our customers  executing our marketing initiatives  and increasing our focus on training 
parts  service and collision repair we refer to the parts  service and collision repair area of our business as fixed operations 
we sell parts and provide maintenance and repair service at all of our franchised dealerships  primarily for the vehicle brands sold at those dealerships 
in addition  as of december   we maintained free standing collision repair centers either on the premises of  or in close proximity to  our dealerships 
our dealerships and collision repair centers collectively operate  service bays 
parts  service and collision repair centers accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit as of december  historically  fixed operations revenues have been more stable than vehicle sales 
industry wide  parts and service revenues have consistently increased over time primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles  the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increased number of vehicles on the road 
we believe the variety and quality of extended service plans available for both new and used vehicles in recent years have seen progressive expansion and improvement 
our fixed operations business benefits from the service work generated through the sale of extended service contracts to customers who purchase new and used vehicles from us because customers tend to service their vehicles at the same location where they purchase extended warranty contracts 
for the year ended december   warranty work accounted for of our parts and service revenue 
historically  the automotive repair industry has been highly fragmented 
we believe  however  that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles has made it difficult for independent repair shops to have the expertise to perform major or technical repairs  especially as such repairs relate to luxury and mid line imports which comprise a majority of our new vehicle retail sales 
additionally  all manufacturers require warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships 
as a result  unlike independent service stations or independent and superstore used car dealerships with service operations  our franchised dealerships are qualified to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly technologically complex motor vehicles 
we use variable rate compensation structures designed to reflect the difficulty and sophistication of different types of repairs to compensate employees working in parts and service 

table of contents one of our major goals is to retain each vehicle purchaser as a long term customer of our parts and service departments 
currently  we estimate that approximately of customers return to our dealerships for other services after the vehicle warranty expires 
therefore  we believe that significant opportunity for growth exists in our maintenance service business 
each dealership has systems in place to track customer maintenance records and to notify owners of vehicles purchased at the dealership when their vehicles are due for periodic services 
in  we implemented additional customer retention initiatives and expanded our service offerings to essentially make the fixed operations business at our stores a one stop shop 
service and repair activities are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service 
from selling tires to utilizing state of the art diagnostic equipment  our fixed operations business offers our customers all the services needed to maintain their vehicles 
in order to grow our fixed operations business over the years  we have consistently added technicians and other employees to our service centers to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
we maintained growth in this line of our business in due to initiatives in and our investment in human capital in past years 
in  we continued to execute our business plan of advancing our customer pay business by offering our customers a one stop shopping experience 
we continued to train our staff  including service advisors  on menu selling and customer service skills 
we have also added business development centers in some of our stores to drive customer retention 
at these business development centers  we have staff dedicated to maintaining periodic contact with our customers 
furthermore  we have continued to add equipment to our service centers that help our technicians identify issues with our customers vehicles and promote incremental service sales if those customers decide to resolve such issues at our stores 
we expect our fixed operations sales to continue to grow as we i invest in additional service capacity  ii upgrade equipment  iii expand our product offerings  iv capitalize on our regional training programs  and v add service advisors and skilled technicians to meet anticipated future demand  especially from the increased market share of the mid line import and luxury import brands 
finance and insurance we refer to the finance and insurance area of our business as f i 
we arrange for third party financing of the sale or lease of new and used vehicles to customers 
we arranged customer financing on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the year ended december  these transactions result in commissions being paid to us by the third party lenders  including manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries 
as a general matter  we do not retain liability for the credit risk associated with these purchase and lease transactions after the completion of the transactions 
however  we may be required to repay the finance company certain commissions if a customer prepays the retail installment sales contract  typically during a specified time period following the sale 
our finance and insurance business generated approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  to date  we have entered into preferred lender agreements with lenders 
under the terms of the preferred lender agreements  each lender has agreed to provide a marketing fee to us above the standard commission for each loan that our dealerships place with that lender 
furthermore  many of the insurance products we sell result in additional underwriting profits and investment income based on portfolio performance 
we receive favorable pricing on these products from our vendors as a result of our size and sales volume 
we earn sales based commissions on substantially all of these products and may be charged back chargebacks for these commissions in the event a finance contract is cancelled within the first days or if a non finance contract is canceled prior to its maturity 
we incur minimal risk related to chargebacks of our commissions  however  we do not bear any risk related to loan payments  insurance payments or investment performance  which are borne by third parties 
these commissions are subject to cancellation  in certain circumstances  if the customer were to cancel the contract 
in addition  we completed the rollout of a training program in for the certification all of our f i managers  sales managers and sales associates in legal and ethical compliance matters 
as of december   all of our finance service managers  sales managers and sales associates with an employment history with the company for months or more  were certified  and any such manager or associate who joined the company during was in the process of being certified 
recent developments during  we were granted two smart car franchises 
our smart car franchise in st 
louis  missouri  commenced operations on january  and our smart car franchise in tampa  florida  is expected to commence operations in the second quarter of in january  our board of directors declared a per share cash dividend 
this was the seventh consecutive quarter that a dividend was paid 

table of contents in january  we sold four franchises three dealership locations for proceeds of million  resulting in a million loss on the sales 
business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification we classify our franchise sales into luxury  mid line import  mid line domestic  value  and heavy trucks 
luxury and mid line imports together accounted for approximately of our new light vehicle retail revenues for the year ended december  over the last two decades  luxury and mid line imports have gained market share at the expense of mid line domestic brands 
luxury and mid line import vehicles have delivered more desirable vehicle models and have demonstrated greater resilience to downturns in the economy  garnered higher customer loyalty and presented more attractive service and used car opportunities 
the mid line import brands are generally viewed as more fuel efficient and continue to be in higher demand during times when gas prices are high 

table of contents the following table reflects the franchises and the share of new retail vehicle revenue represented by each class of franchise as of december  class franchise number of franchises as of december  of new light vehicle retail revenue for the year ended december  light vehicles luxury bmw acura mercedes benz lincoln volvo cadillac infiniti lexus audi porsche jaguar land rover total luxury mid line import honda nissan toyota mazda mini volkswagen c total mid line import mid line domestic chevrolet gmc pontiac chrysler a ford mercury buick jeep a dodge total mid line domestic value hyundai kia b total value total light vehicles heavy trucks hino isuzu international trucks ic bus workhorse peterbilt total heavy trucks total franchise accounted for less than of new retail vehicle revenue for the year ended december  a includes a pending divestiture as of december   which was sold in the first quarter of 
table of contents b includes two pending divestitures as of december   which were completed in the first quarter of c includes a pending divestiture as of december  asbury s geographic coverage encompassed different metropolitan markets at locations in states as of december   including arkansas  california  florida  georgia  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  north carolina  south carolina  texas and virginia 
new vehicle sales revenue is diversified among manufacturers and for the year ended december   the following manufacturers represented of our new light vehicle retail revenue honda  nissan  mercedes benz  toyota  bmw  lexus  ford and acura 
we believe that our broad geographic coverage as well as diversification among manufacturers decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as warranty issues or production disruption 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers may negatively impact our profitability for a list of such manufacturer specific risks 
each of our dealerships maintains a strong local brand that has been enhanced through local advertising over many years 
we believe our cultivation of strong local brands is beneficial because consumers prefer to interact with a locally recognized brand 
by placing franchises in one geographic location under a single  local brand  we expect to generate advertising synergies and retain customers even as they purchase and service different automobile brands 
maintain flexible cost structure and emphasize expense control we continually focus on controlling expenses and expanding margins at our existing dealerships and those that are integrated into our operations upon acquisition 
we categorize our cost structure in three groups  which are variable  semi variable and fixed 
variable costs include incentive based compensation  vehicle carrying costs  and other variable costs 
salespeople  sales managers  service managers  parts managers  service advisors  service technicians and the majority of other non clerical dealership personnel are paid a commission 
the majority of our general manager compensation and virtually all salesperson compensation is tied to profits of the dealership 
in addition the bonus portion of our salaried employee s compensation is tied to our net income 
fixed costs include rent  utilities and depreciation expense 
semi variable expenses include base salaries  outside services  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and loaner vehicle amortization 
we believe we can further manage these types of costs by capitalizing on best practices among our dealerships  standardization of compensation plans  controlled oversight and accountability  and centralized processing systems 
focus on higher margin products and services while new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships  fixed operations  used vehicle retail sales  and finance and insurance generally provide significantly higher profit margins and account for the majority of our profitability 
in addition  we have discipline specific executives at both the corporate and regional levels who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers 
while each of our dealership general managers has flexibility to respond effectively to local market conditions  including market specific advertising and management of inventory mix  each pursues an integrated strategy  as directed from our centralized management team at our corporate office  to grow these higher margin businesses to enhance profitability and stimulate organic growth 
fixed operations 
we offer parts  perform vehicle service work and operate collision repair centers  all of which provide important sources of recurring revenue with high gross profit margins 
we intend to expand this higher margin business and increase this cost absorption rate by adding new service bays and increasing capacity utilization of existing service bays 
to help ensure high levels of customer satisfaction within our parts  service and collision repair operations  we continue to add skilled technicians and service advisors to our operations 
in addition  given the increased sophistication of vehicles  our repair operations provide detailed expertise and state of the art diagnostic equipment that we believe independent repair shops cannot adequately provide 
our repair operations also provide manufacturer warranty work that must be done at certified franchise dealerships  rather than through independent dealers 

table of contents used vehicles 
we sell used vehicles at all of our franchised dealerships 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction 
we intend to grow our used vehicle business by maintaining high quality inventory across all price ranges  providing competitive prices  continuing to enhance our marketing initiatives by focusing our efforts on marketing new vehicles through the internet and building customer confidence in our vehicle inventory through our used car certification program 
finance and insurance 
in the past two years  we have increased our finance and insurance revenues by offering a broad range of conventional finance and lease alternatives to fund the purchase of new and used vehicles 
moreover  continued in depth sales training and certification efforts and innovative computer technologies have and will serve as important tools in growing our finance and insurance profitability 
we have increased dealership generated finance and insurance revenue per vehicle retailed pvr to approximately for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  we have successfully increased our dealership generated finance and insurance revenue pvr each year since our inception  with being another record year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reconciliation of non gaap financial information 
local management of dealership operations and centralized administrative and strategic functions we believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales  customer service and inventory requirements 
our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers in which the general managers are responsible for the operations  personnel and financial performance of their dealerships as well as other day to day operations 
our local management teams familiarity with their markets enables them to effectively run day to day operations  market to customers and recruit new employees 
the general manager of each dealership is supported by a management team consisting  in most cases  of a new vehicle sales manager  a used vehicle sales manager  a finance and insurance manager  and a fixed operations manager 
this management structure is complemented by regionally centralized technology and financial controls  as well as sharing market intelligence throughout the organization 
see business strategy experienced corporate and dealership management below for a discussion of the incentive based pay system for management at our corporate office and at our dealerships 
our corporate headquarters are located in new york  new york 
the corporate office is responsible for the capital structure of the business and its expansion and operating strategy 
the implementation of our operational strategy rests with each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures established and promulgated by the corporate office 
furthermore  we employ professional management practices in all aspects of our operations  including information technology and employee training 
our dealership operations are complemented by regionally centralized technology and strategic and financial controls  as well as shared market intelligence throughout the organization 
corporate and dealership management utilize computer based management information systems to monitor each dealership s sales  profitability and inventory on a regular basis 
while in the past we have used various companies to provide our dealer management systems  in october  we executed an agreement with dealertrack holdings  inc dealertrack  with the intent that the dealertrack s arkona dealer management system will become our sole dealer management system 
by moving toward a single dealer management system through which all our dealerships will process information  we expect that the result will be a more efficient retail operation that will  in turn  translate to a better experience for our customers 
moreover  once all of our dealerships convert to  and are running on  the arkona dealer management system  we expect to achieve a reduction of over million of our current annual data processing costs 
we believe the application of professional management practices provides us with a competitive advantage over many independent dealerships 
we regularly examine our operations in order to identify areas for improvement and disseminate best practices company wide 

table of contents investment in human capital we recognize that our ability to control the growth of our new vehicle sales is limited by external factors  including the manufacturers ability to develop new vehicle models  manufacturer rebates and incentives  consumer confidence  gas prices  interest rates  the availability of credit for consumers and other economic factors 
growth in our fixed operations business is dependent on our ability to generate long term customer relationships and having our customers return to our stores for service and repairs 
our finance and insurance business is dependent on our ability to arrange financing for our customers through third party lenders 
in each revenue source of our business  our ability to capture the customer and close the deal will enable us to generate revenue 
in our effort to seek continued growth in all of our revenue sources and set us apart from our competitors  we invest in the education and growth of our employees 
over the past three years  we have implemented programs to certify our finance and insurance managers  our new and used sales managers and our sales force in the areas of compliance and ethics 
these employees either attend classes or seminars on compliance and ethics as such topics relate to the automotive retailing industry  and more specifically  finance and insurance for the finance and insurance managers  and are then required to pass a written examination on these subjects in order to receive certification 
the employees are required to maintain their certification annually  which keeps their knowledge of compliance and ethics current 
furthermore  we believe that by certifying these employees  we build the knowledge base of our employees  which improves morale and performance 
in addition  in three of our four regions  we have a regional training program for our fixed operations employees that addresses various aspects of our fixed operations business  including tire sales and oil sales 
our fixed operation employees are trained so that they can offer new car clinics and service clinics to our customers 
we believe that by increasing the knowledge base of our fixed operations employees  we not only build their confidence and increase their performance  but also provide better experience for our customers as they interact with those employees 
we believe that a customer who has a positive experience with one of our employees will be a repeat customer  which will lead to the continued growth of our business 
we will implement similar training programs in our fourth region during our corporate and regional executives have also benefited from attending a management training program to assist them in setting and reaching goals  both personally and professionally  and the effective management of their staff 
through exposure to such training programs  we empower our corporate and regional executive team to work together more efficiently in the management of the business and its employees 
we believe that a motivated management team will have a direct  positive effect on its staff 
with a highly motivated and goal oriented workforce  we believe that we can generate above average corporate performance 
experienced corporate and dealership management we have a corporate management team that has served in prominent leadership positions

gordon smith has served as our senior vice president and chief financial officer since september he joined us following over years with general electric company ge 
during his last twelve years at ge he served as chief financial officer for three of ge s commercial finance businesses corporate financial services  commercial equipment finance and capital markets 
we believe that our leadership at the store level represents some of the best talent in the industry 
our regional executives and store general managers are proven leaders in their local markets and have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry 
in addition  our continued focus on college recruiting  training  development  and retention is designed to maintain our talented management pool 
see business strategy investment in human capital above for further description of certain of our training programs 
we tie compensation of our senior dealership management to performance by relying upon an incentive based pay system 
we compensate our general managers based on dealership profitability  and our department managers and salespeople are similarly compensated based upon departmental profitability and individual performance 

table of contents continued growth through targeted acquisitions acquisitions continue to be part of our growth strategy 
in the past  we have focused our acquisition strategy on establishing a presence in new markets through the purchase of multiple individual franchises or through the acquisition of large  profitable and well managed dealership groups with leading market positions 
our present strategy is to become the leader in every market in which we currently operate 
as such  we intend to evaluate tuck in acquisitions  or acquisitions in existing regions  that complement our current dealerships 
tuck in acquisitions are typically re branded immediately after acquisition and operate thereafter under our respective local brand name 
by focusing on geographic and brand diversity  we seek to manage economic risk and drive growth and profitability 
because we own dealerships of all major brands and avoid significant concentration with one manufacturer  we are well positioned to respond to changing customer preferences 
we believe that these tuck in acquisitions have facilitated  and will continue to facilitate  our regional operating efficiencies and cost savings 
in addition  we have generally been able to improve the gross profit of tuck in acquisitions within twelve months following the acquisition 
we believe this is due to a number of factors respective to the acquisition  including improvements in the number of finance and insurance products sold per vehicle retailed  greater utilization of service bays acquired in the acquisition  improved management practices  and enhanced unit sales volumes related to the strength of our local brand names 
we will also continuously examine opportunities to acquire large dealership groups or to enter new markets as such opportunities become available 
in  we availed ourselves of such an opportunity by acquiring a bmw franchise in princeton  new jersey  which is outside the regions in which we have historically operated 
commitment to customer service we are focused on providing a high level of customer service to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer 
we design our dealership service business to meet the needs of our customers and establish relationships that will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals 
furthermore  we provide our dealership managers with incentives to employ more efficient selling approaches  engage in extensive follow up to develop long term relationships with customers and extensively train our sales staff to be able to meet customer needs 
we continually evaluate innovative ways  and implement new technology  to improve the buying experience for our customers  and believe that our ability to share best practices across our dealerships gives us an advantage over independent dealerships 
for example  our customer relations management tool facilitates communications with our customers before  during and after the sale 
our auto exchange system continues to be our used car inventory management tool 
these tools are installed in most of our regions and are designed to drive the performance of our employees and enhance customer service 
see also the discussion above under business strategy local management of dealer operations and centralized administrative and strategic functions for a discussion of our expectation that the use of the arkona dealer management system will improve the customer experience 
in addition  our dealerships regard service and repair operations as an integral part of the overall approach to customer service  providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships and improve customer loyalty 
we continue to add skilled technicians and service advisors to our operations to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
we intend to invest in the human capital necessary to ensure that this aspect of our business continues to expand 
marketing our advertising and marketing efforts are focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our business with a broad base of repeat  referral and new customers 
our primary advertising medium is local newspapers  followed by the internet  radio  television  direct mail  and the yellow pages 
in addition  we also use electronic mail to assist our marketing efforts and to stay in contact with our customers 
the automotive retail industry has traditionally used locally produced  largely non professional materials for advertising  often developed under the direction of each dealership s general manager 
however  we have chosen to create common marketing materials for our brand names using professional advertising agencies 
our corporate sales and marketing department helps oversee and share creative materials and general marketing best 
table of contents practices across our dealerships 
our total company marketing expense was million for the year ended december   which translates into an average of per retail vehicle sold 
in addition  manufacturers direct advertising spending in support of their brands has historically been a significant component of the total amount spent on new car advertising in the united states 
management information systems we consolidate financial  accounting and operational data received from our dealerships nationwide through a private communication network 
the data from the dealerships is gathered and processed through their individual dealer management system 
currently  each of our dealerships use dealer management system software from adp  inc  reynolds reynolds  co 
or dealertrack 
in october  we entered into an agreement with dealertrack to convert all of our dealerships to the arkona dealer management system 
pursuant to the terms of such contract  we intend to complete the roll out of the arkona dealer management system to all of our dealerships within approximately three years 
the information from the dealer systems is aggregated at our corporate headquarters to create a consolidated view of the business using hyperion financial products 
our information technology approach enables us to quickly integrate and aggregate the information from a new acquisition 
by creating a connection over our private network between the dealer management system and corporate hyperion financial products  corporate management can quickly view the financial  accounting and operational data of the newly acquired dealership 
hyperion s products allow us to review operating and financial data at a variety of levels 
for example  from our headquarters  management can review the performance of any specific department eg  parts and services at any particular dealership 
this system also allows us to quickly compile and monitor our consolidated financial results 
competition in new vehicle sales  our dealerships compete primarily with other franchised dealerships in their regions 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from the manufacturers 
instead  we rely on advertising and merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local brand names and location of our dealerships to sell new vehicles 
our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealers  independent used car dealers  internet based vehicle brokers and private parties for supply and resale of used vehicles 
see risk factors risks related to competition substantial competition in automobile sales may adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automobile dealers and franchised and independent service centers for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automobile dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are the use of factory approved replacement parts  price  the familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models  and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains as well as some competing franchised dealers may offer certain parts and services at prices lower than our prices 
in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  financial institutions are now offering finance and insurance products through the internet  which may reduce our profits on these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and flexibility in contract length 
we compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and the market may increase acquisition pricing of target dealerships 
see risk factors risks related to our acquisition strategy there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships  and we may not be able to fully implement our growth through acquisition strategy if attractive targets are acquired by competing buyers or if the market drives prices to the point where an acceptable rate of return is not achievable 

table of contents dealer and framework agreements each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer or in some cases the distributor of each brand of new vehicles sold and or serviced at the dealership 
our typical dealer agreement specifies the locations at which the dealer has the right and obligation to sell the manufacturer s vehicles and related parts and products and or to perform certain approved services 
each dealer agreement also governs the use of the manufacturer s trademarks and service marks 
the allocation of new vehicles among dealerships is subject to the discretion of the manufacturer  and generally does not guarantee the dealership exclusivity within a given territory 
most dealer agreements impose requirements on virtually every aspect of the dealer s operations 
for example  most of our dealer agreements contain provisions and standards related to inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts  the maintenance of minimum net working capital and in some cases minimum net worth  the achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets  advertising and marketing practices  facilities  signs  products offered to customers  dealership management  personnel training  information systems  and dealership monthly and annual financial reporting 
in addition to requirements under dealer agreements  we are subject to additional provisions contained in supplemental agreements  framework agreements  dealer addenda and manufacturers policies  collectively referred to as framework agreements 
framework agreements impose additional requirements similar to those discussed above 
such agreements also define other standards and limitations  including company wide performance criteria  capitalization requirements  limitations on changes in our ownership or management  limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us  restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries  and conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions  including sales and customer satisfaction criteria as well as limitations on the total local  regional and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition 
some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to purchase its dealerships from us under certain circumstances  including the occurrence of an extraordinary corporate transaction without the manufacturer s prior consent or a material breach of the framework agreement 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer s brands to a third party 
these agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under state dealer laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration 
provisions for termination or non renewal of dealer and framework agreements 
certain of our dealer agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one year to six years  while other of our agreements have a perpetual term 
we expect to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business 
however  typical dealer agreements give the manufacturer the right to terminate or the option of non renewal of the dealer agreements under certain circumstances  including insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership  failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels  impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  change of control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  
table of contents failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer  or material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement 
see risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected  for a further discussion of the risks related to the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements 
while our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed for the reasons listed above  it is possible to negotiate a waiver of termination or non renewal with the manufacturer 
regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry 
under various state laws each of our dealerships must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service 
in addition  we are subject to federal  state and local laws regulating the conduct of our business including advertising  motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  truth in lending  deceptive trade practices  consumer protection and disclosure  consumer privacy  money laundering  environmental  land use and zoning  health and safety and employment practices 
our business is also subject to laws and regulations generally relating to corporate entities 
we actively make efforts to assure we are in compliance with these laws and related regulations 
see risk factors risks related to the automotive retail industry our operations are subject to substantial laws and regulation and related claims and proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we benefit from the protection of state dealer laws which limit a manufacturer s ability to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement  provide dealers with protest rights with respect to the addition of dealerships within proscribed geographic areas  and protect dealers against manufacturers unreasonably withholding consent to proposed changes in ownership of dealerships 
however  some framework agreements attempt to limit the protection of state dealer laws 
see risk factors risks related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if state dealer laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed or weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
environmental matters we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and the remediation of contamination 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes 
operations involving the management of wastes are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
pursuant to these laws  federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply 
our business also involves the use of above ground and underground storage tanks 
under applicable laws and regulations  we are responsible for the proper use  maintenance and abandonment of our regulated storage tanks and for remediation of subsurface soils and groundwater impacted by releases from existing or abandoned storage tanks 
in addition to these regulated tanks  we own  operate  or have otherwise closed in place other underground and above ground devices or containers such as automotive lifts and service pits that may not be classified as regulated tanks  but which could or may have released stored materials into the environment  thereby potentially obligating us to clean up any soils or groundwater resulting from such releases 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at or from our facilities or at facilities where we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state statutes  imposes liability for the entire cost of a cleanup  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at such sites 
these responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances 
currently  we are not aware of any material superfund or other remedial liabilities to which we are subject 

table of contents further  the federal clean water act and comparable state statutes prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without the necessary permits  require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans 
we are not aware of any non compliance with the wastewater discharge requirements  requirements for the containment of potential discharges and spill contingency planning or other environmental laws applicable to our operations 
environmental laws and regulations are very complex and it has become difficult for businesses that routinely handle hazardous and non hazardous wastes to achieve and maintain full compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
from time to time we experience incidents and encounter conditions that will not be in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
however  none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past  nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future 
nevertheless  environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement are changed frequently and we believe that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue 
as a result  there can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations or the future discovery of unknown environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures would not be material 
our operations are subject to substantial laws and regulations and related claims and proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  people 
we believe our relationship with our employees is favorable 
we do not have employees that are represented by a labor union 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses that have unionized employees 
certain of our facilities are located in areas of high union concentration  and such facilities are susceptible to union organizing activity 
in addition  because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers  we may be affected adversely by labor strikes  work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturers production facilities and transportation modes 
insurance because of their vehicle inventory and the nature of the automotive retail business  automobile retail dealerships generally require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
our insurance program includes multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of million 
we also have directors and officers insurance  real property insurance  comprehensive coverage for our vehicle inventory  garage liability and employee dishonesty insurance 
item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating our business 
risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on favorable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  or if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  our operations may be adversely affected 
each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer or manufacturer authorized distributor of each new vehicle brand it carries and or is authorized to service 
our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers  service vehicles  sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers trademarks only to the extent permitted under dealer agreements 
as a result of the terms of our dealer  framework and related agreements and our dependence on these franchise rights  manufacturers exercise a great deal of control over our day to day operations and the terms of these agreements govern key aspects of our operations  acquisition strategy and capital spending 
our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by manufacturers for a number of reasons  and many of the manufacturers have the right to direct us to divest our dealerships if there is a default under the franchise agreement  an unapproved change of control  or other unapproved events 
we cannot assure you we will be able to renew any of our existing dealer agreements or that we will be able to obtain renewals on favorable terms 
most of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with the right of first refusal to 
table of contents purchase from us any franchise we seek to sell 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our franchise rights become compromised or our operations restricted due to the terms of our dealer agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant source of our revenues 
our failure to meet manufacturer consumer satisfaction  financial or sales performance requirements may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known in the automotive retailing industry as consumer satisfaction indexes csi 
csi ratings are in addition to the right of manufacturers to monitor the financial and sales performance of dealerships 
at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealership or framework agreement  several manufacturers establish sales or performance criteria for that dealership  in some cases in the form of a business plan 
these criteria have been modified by various manufacturers from time to time in the past  and we cannot assure you that they will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future 
some of our dealerships have had difficulty from time to time meeting these standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these standards in the future 
in addition  manufacturers may use these criteria as factors in evaluating applications for acquisitions 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance standards 
this may impede our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and hinder our ability to grow 
see also  risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
in addition  we receive payments and incentives from certain manufacturers based  in part  on csi scores  and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi scores decline 
the reorganization or bankruptcy of one or more of the manufacturers could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
certain manufacturers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent periods 
sustained periods of poor financial performance by a manufacturer may force it to seek to reorganize or to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy 
a reorganization by a manufacturer may  among other things  result in a delay in the introduction of new or competitive makes or models  an elimination of certain makes or models or dealership locations  a disruption in delivery or availability of service or parts  a delay or failure to reimburse us for warranty work and holdback receivables  or a disruption in vehicle deliveries to our dealerships 
if an attempted reorganization proves unsuccessful for the manufacturer  the continued financial distress could result in the cessation of its operations 
in the event of a bankruptcy by a vehicle manufacturer  among other things i the manufacturer could seek to terminate all or certain of our franchises  and we may not receive adequate compensation for them  ii we may not be able to collect some or all of our receivables that are due from such manufacturer and we may be subject to preference claims relating to payments to us made by such manufacturer prior to bankruptcy  iii it may increase our cost to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory with such manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary  which may cause us to finance our new vehicle inventory with alternate finance sources on less favorable terms  and iv consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be materially adversely affected  especially if costs related to improving such manufacturer s poor financial condition are imputed to the price of its products 
the occurrence of any one or more of the above mentioned events could have a material adverse affect on our day to day operations 
furthermore  such events could result in a partial write down of our manufacturer franchise rights to the extent that we have recorded them or our receivables  and a partial write down of our goodwill 
see also risk factors risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire any additional dealerships 
in addition  many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain customer service and sales performance standards as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will meet these performance standards or that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions  which may deter us from being able to take advantage of market opportunities and restrict our ability to expand our business 
the process of applying for and obtaining manufacturer consents can take a significant amount of time  generally to days or more 
delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe will produce acquisition synergies and integrate well into our overall growth strategy 
in addition  manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their 
table of contents dealerships on a case by case basis 
as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition  a manufacturer may require us to remodel and upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose  causing us to divert our financial resources from uses that management believes may be of higher long term value to us 
furthermore  the exercise by manufacturers of their right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we have identified as important to our growth  thereby having an adverse affect on our ability to grow through acquisitions 
many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may own 
certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national  regional or local basis  as well as limits on store ownership in contiguous markets 
if we reach these limits  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions  which could affect our growth 
if state dealer laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
applicable state dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
we have framework agreements with certain of our manufacturers 
among other provisions  these agreements attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their dealer agreements upon expiration 
see business dealer and framework agreements regulations 
our dealerships depend upon vehicle sales and  therefore  their success depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry 
the success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue through new vehicle sales 
new vehicle sales also tend to lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and services 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand  we have focused our new vehicle sales operations on mid line import and luxury brands 
for the year ended december   brands representing or more of our revenues from new vehicle retail sales were as follows brand of total new light vehicle retail sales honda nissan mercedes benz toyota bmw lexus ford acura no other brand accounted for more than of our total new vehicle retail sales revenue for the year ended december  if we fail to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles 
typically  popular vehicles produce the highest profit margins but tend to be the most difficult to obtain from manufacturers 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership and in some instances on the level of capital expenditures 
if our dealerships experience prolonged sales slumps  those manufacturers will cut back their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and new vehicle sales and profits may decline 

table of contents if automobile manufacturers decrease or discontinue incentive programs  our sales volumes may be adversely affected 
our dealerships benefit from certain sales incentives  warranties and other programs of our manufacturers that are intended to promote and support new vehicle sales 
some key incentive programs include customer rebates on new vehicles  dealer incentives on new vehicles  special financing or leasing terms  and warranties on new and used vehicles 
manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
a reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers incentive programs may reduce our new vehicle unit sales and related revenue 
adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers of the vehicles that we sell may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
our ability to successfully market vehicles to the public depends to a great extent on aspects of our manufacturers operations 
conditions which negatively affect our manufacturers in the following areas could similarly have an adverse affect on our revenues and profitability financial condition  marketing efforts  vehicle design  production capabilities  reputation for quality  management  and labor relations 
manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or  in some cases  its parent  without manufacturer consent 
our agreements with some manufacturers provide that  under certain circumstances  we may lose the franchise either through termination or forced sale if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote a specified level of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
violations by our stockholders of these ownership restrictions are generally outside of our control and may result in the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
risks related to competition substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  internet based used vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers  
table of contents service center chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we typically rely on advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles 
our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues or profitability may be materially and adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or additional franchises are awarded in our markets 
risks related to the automotive retail industry our business will be harmed if overall consumer demand suffers from a significant or sustained downturn 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
our revenues will be materially and adversely affected if there is a significant or sustained downturn in overall levels of consumer spending 
retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as the level of discretionary personal income  credit availability and interest rates 
the current economic climate in the united states and future recessions may have a material adverse effect on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles 
in addition  significant or sustained increases in gasoline prices may lead to a reduction in automobile purchases or a shift in buying patterns from luxury or suv models which typically provide higher profit margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower margins 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in our various geographic areas 
our dealerships currently are located in the atlanta  austin  chapel hill  charlotte  charlottesville  dallas fort worth  fayetteville  fort pierce  fresno  greensboro  greenville  houston  jackson  jacksonville  little rock  los angeles  orlando  princeton  richmond  sacramento  st 
louis and tampa markets and the results of our operations therefore depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending levels in those areas 
the seasonality of the automobile retail business magnifies the importance of our second and third quarter results 
the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for automobiles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in our first and fourth quarters than in our second and third quarters 
if conditions surface during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year will be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions  foreign trade risks and currency valuations that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably 
a portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including import duties  exchange rates  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
the relative weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies may adversely affect our cost of purchase of certain vehicles  which may also result in an increase in the retail price of such vehicles  which could discourage consumers from purchasing such vehicles 
this could adversely impact our profitability 

table of contents a decline of available financing may adversely affect our sales of vehicles and the results of our finance and insurance business 
the majority of vehicle buyers finance their purchases  particularly those seeking to purchase used vehicles 
if there is a decline in the availability of credit or an increase in the cost to consumers for such credit  the ability of consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited  resulting in a decline in our vehicle sales 
retail sales of used vehicles generally have higher gross margins than new vehicles 
a decline in our vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and an adverse effect on our profitability 
risks related to our acquisition strategy if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships  we will be unable to realize desired results from our growth through acquisition strategy and acquired operations will drain resources from comparatively profitable operations 
we believe that the automobile retailing industry is a mature industry whose sales are significantly impacted by the prevailing economic climate in local markets 
accordingly  we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to manage expansion  control costs in our operations and acquire and integrate acquired dealerships into our organization 
in pursuing our strategy of acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to failing to obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises  incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships and impairing relationships with employees  incurring undisclosed liabilities at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources to newly acquired dealerships  and impairing relationships with manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management 
we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel  procedures and structures  including our financial and reporting control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
moreover  our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risk associated with integrating the acquired dealership 
if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands  we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable 
see also risk factors related to our dependence on vehicle manufacturers manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions may limit our future growth and impact our profitability 
there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships  and we may not be able to fully implement our growth through acquisition strategy if attractive targets are acquired by competing buyers or if the market drives prices to the point where an acceptable rate of return is not achievable 
we believe that the united states automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates that meet our target criteria 
however  we compete with several other national  regional and local dealer groups  and other strategic and financial buyers  some of which may have greater financial resources 
competition for attractive acquisition targets may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us  and increased acquisition costs 
we will have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
other risks related to our business failure to comply with certain covenants in our debt and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and adversely affect our compliance with our committee credit facility 
we have certain debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total debt of million  excluding floor plan notes payable and the effects of our fair value hedge on our notes 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries have the ability to obtain additional debt from time to time to finance acquisitions  real property purchases  capital expenditures or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our committed credit facility and the indentures governing our notes and our notes 
we will have substantial debt service obligations  consisting of required cash payments of principal and interest  for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in addition  we have operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt instruments  including our committed credit facility and the indentures under our notes and our notes 
these place restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  and to make certain payments including dividends and repurchases of our shares and investments 
our committed credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of the covenants in our debt instruments or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in the event of any default under our committed credit facility  the payment of all outstanding borrowings could be accelerated  together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees  and we would be required to apply our available cash to repay these borrowings or could be prevented from making debt service payments on our notes  our notes  and our notes  any of which would be an event of default under the respective indentures for such notes 
in addition  as a result of entering into a number of sale leaseback agreements  a number of our dealerships are located on properties that we lease 
each of the leases governing such properties has certain covenants with which we must comply 
the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team 
manufacturer dealer or framework agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the profitability of our operations 
in addition  we may need to hire additional managers as we expand 
potential acquisitions are viable to us only if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner or manager of the acquired dealership not continue to manage the business 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with the standards set by us or the manufacturers 
we depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel 
most of our key personnel not are bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key personnel 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory and have the ability to finance the purchase of used vehicle inventory using floor plan credit facilities under which we are charged interest at floating rates 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain capital for general corporate purposes  dealership acquisitions and property purchases and improvements under predominantly floating interest rate credit facilities 
therefore  our interest expense from variable rate debt will rise with increases in interest rates 
in addition  a significant rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicle sales  because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our costs and reducing our revenues 
given our debt composition as of december   each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense  including floor plan interest  by million 
we receive interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers  which is reflected as a reduction in the cost of inventory on the balance sheet and is recognized as a reduction in cost of sales 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical experience that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
our operations are subject to substantial laws and regulations and related claims and proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  including local licensing requirements 
these laws regulate the conduct of our business  including motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  truth in lending  deceptive 
table of contents trade practices  consumer protection  consumer privacy  money laundering  advertising  land use and zoning  health and safety and employment practices 
environmental laws and regulations govern  among other things  discharges into the air and water  storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases 
if we or our employees at the individual dealerships violate or are alleged to violate these laws and regulations  we could be subject to individual or consumer class actions  administrative  civil or criminal actions investigations or actions and adverse publicity 
such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees and administrative or document fees that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales  which could restrict our ability to generate revenue from these activities future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r business combinations  to provide greater transparency to the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
a substantial change brought about by sfas no 
r is the requirement to expense all acquisition related costs in pre acquisition periods 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will negatively impact our income before taxes by million to million per acquisition 
during  the fasb issued  but subsequently repealed  fsp aba a  which was a proposal to change the accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
should the fasb decided to issue fsp aba a  such proposal would cause an increase to our interest expense by million in item b

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states  operating franchises dealership locations in metropolitan markets within states as of december  we offer an extensive range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  vehicle maintenance  replacement parts  collision repair services  and financing  insurance and service contracts 
we offer domestic and foreign brands of new vehicles  including six heavy truck brands 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve our markets 
our retail network is currently organized into primarily four regions and includes nine locally branded dealership groups i florida comprising our coggin dealerships  operating primarily in jacksonville  fort pierce and orlando  and our courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  ii west comprising our mcdavid dealerships operating throughout texas  our north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas and our california dealerships operating in los angeles  sacramento and fresno  iii mid atlantic comprising our crown dealerships operating in new jersey  north carolina  south carolina and virginia and iv south comprising our nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia 
our plaza dealerships operating in st 
louis  missouri and our gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi remain standalone operations 
we will continue to acquire single point dealerships or small dealership groups in our existing market areas  as well as large luxury franchises outside our existing markets  to grow our business  increase the number of vehicle brands we offer and to create a larger gross profit base over which to spread overhead costs  our revenues are derived primarily from four offerings i the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new retail and the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet the terms new retail and fleet being collectively referred to as new  ii the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being collectively referred to as used  iii maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts at retail and wholesale collectively referred to as fixed operations  and iv the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of various insurance and warranty products collectively referred to as f i 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle retailed pvr  our fixed operations based on aggregate gross profit  and f i based on dealership generated f i pvr 
we assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit by comparing the year to year results of stores that we have operated for at least twelve months 
the organic growth of our company is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy as well as our strong brand mix  which is heavily weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands 
sales of vehicles have historically fluctuated with general macroeconomic conditions  including consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit and fuel prices 
we believe that any future negative trends in new vehicle sales will be mitigated by i the stability of our fixed operations  ii our variable cost structure and iii our advantageous brand mix 
historically  our brand mix has been less affected by market volatility than the us automobile industry as a whole 
we expect the recent industry wide gain in market share of the luxury and mid line import brands to continue in the near future 
our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of new vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales and revenues generated from our fixed operations business 
as a result  when used vehicle and fixed operations revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase 
we continue to implement new initiatives specifically designed to accelerate the growth of our high margin businesses and to leverage our selling  general and administrative sg a expense structure 
sg a expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other customary operating expenses 
a significant portion of our selling expenses is variable such as sales commissions  or controllable expenses such as advertising  generally allowing our cost structure to adapt to changes in the retail environment 
we evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit and all other sg a expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit 
our operations are generally subject to seasonal variations as we tend to generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
generally  the seasonal variations in our operations are caused by factors relating to weather conditions  changes in manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns  among other things 
over the past several years  certain automobile manufacturers have used a combination of vehicle pricing and financing incentive programs to generate increased customer demand for new vehicles 
we anticipate that the manufacturers will continue to use these incentive programs in the near future to drive demand for their product offerings

our income from continuing operations during and was impacted by several items shown below collectively referred to as adjusting items 
we believe that an alternative comparison of our income from continuing operations adjusted income from continuing operations  which is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  can be made by adjusting for items that are not core dealership operating items and should not be considered when forecasting our future results 
these adjusting items are excluded by management when comparing actual results to forecasted results and are generally not included in external financial estimates of our business 
the non gaap measure adjusted income from continuing operations contains material limitations 
although we believe that corporate generated f i gross profit  retirement benefits expenses  abandoned strategic project expenses  secondary stock offering expenses  losses from the extinguishment of long term debt and legal settlement claims arising in  and before  the year  are infrequent  and although we do not expect to recognize these items in the future  we cannot assure you that we will not recognize them in the future 
our income from continuing operations may not be comparable with income from continuing operations of other companies to the extent that other companies recognize similar items in income from continuing operations and do not provide disclosure of the amounts 
in order to compensate for these limitations we also review the related gaap measures 
in addition  these non gaap measures are not defined by gaap and our definition of each measure may differ from  and therefore may not be comparable to  similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap

the following discussion excludes the impact of the adjusting items as we believe that excluding these items provides a more accurate representation of our year over year core dealership performance 
despite a challenging retail sales and overall weak economic environment in the second half of  our adjusted income from continuing operations increased million as compared to the period 
contributing to this increase in adjusted income from continuing operations was increased fixed operations and f i gross profit of million and million  respectively  partially offset by i our used vehicle operations  which generated million less gross profit during as compared to  due to a basis point decrease in gross margin  primarily as a result of a softening economic environment in the second half of  and ii a basis point increase in our adjusted selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of adjusted gross profit 
in addition  our other interest expense decreased million due to a lower average effective interest rate on our long term debt as a result of our long term debt refinancing  which was substantially completed during the first quarter of and finalized in the second quarter of the million increase in total revenue was primarily a result of a million increase in fixed operations revenue  a million increase in used vehicle revenue and a million increase in f i  partially offset by a million decrease in new vehicle revenue 
the increase in used vehicle revenue includes million of used vehicle revenue from dealership acquisitions  a million increase in same store wholesale revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in same store retail revenue

the million decrease in new vehicle revenue was primarily a result of a million decrease in heavy truck revenue 
the decrease in heavy truck revenue was as a result of a decrease in unit sales due to i changes in emission laws in january  which pulled forward demand for heavy trucks into and ii a weaker freight hauling market during same store light vehicle retail revenue decreased million during a challenging retail sales and overall weak economic environment  particularly in the second half of  primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit sales from mid line domestic brands as these brands continue to lose market share to mid line import and luxury brands 
in addition  same store retail revenue from our mid line import brands decreased on flat same store unit sales as manufacturer incentive programs in the prior year resulted in a challenging comparison 
however  our same store retail revenue from our luxury brands increased million  driven by a increase in revenue pvr as a result of a shift towards higher priced luxury models as luxury brands continue to offer attractive products 
the million decrease in new vehicle gross profit was due to i a million decrease in same store gross profit from the sale of mid line domestic brands  primarily as a result of a decrease in same store unit sales  ii a million decrease in heavy truck gross profit as a result of a decrease in heavy truck unit sales and iii a million decrease in gross profit from our luxury brands 
these decreases in same store gross profit were partially offset by million of gross profit from dealerships acquired during we expect to be a challenging retail environment and as a result we expect it to be difficult to maintain our current new vehicle revenue and gross profit levels  however  we expect our light vehicle unit sales to outperform industry wide us light vehicle unit sales  as we believe the luxury and mid line import brands will continue to increase market share 
in addition  we expect heavy trucks unit sales  revenue and gross profit to continue to decrease in the first half of as compared to the prior year period  as a result of the adverse impact of the new emission laws on heavy truck demand and a weaker freight hauling market

the million increase in used vehicle revenue includes million from dealership acquisitions and a million increase in same store wholesale revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in same store retail revenue 
the million decrease in used vehicle gross profit was primarily a result of a million decrease in retail gross profit 
our comparison from the prior year continues to be difficult as we have benefited in recent years from i targeted initiatives  including the building of experienced used vehicle teams  ii our investments in technology to better value trade ins and improve inventory management and iii strong used vehicle sales in the period in houston and mississippi in the aftermath of hurricane katrina 
in addition  we have experienced reduced used vehicle sales to sub prime customers as a result of the weakening economy and tighter lending practices  particularly in the second half of we are closely managing our sub prime business and continue to believe there is opportunity to improve our used vehicle profitability by offering appropriately priced used vehicle inventory 

table of contents the strong used vehicle wholesale environment during the second and third quarters significantly increased the cost to acquire used vehicle inventory  increasing pressure on our used retail margins and used retail unit sales in the second half of in addition  we believe used vehicle customers were attracted to competitively priced mid line import and mid line domestic new vehicles as a result of manufacturer incentive programs 
during the third quarter of  we began a strategic initiative to realign our inventory to i serve the broader used vehicle market and ii lower our inventory in response to the slower retail environment 
although our same store wholesale losses increased million during and our retail margins decreased while lowering our used vehicle inventory by  we believe our used vehicle inventory is better aligned with customer demand 
we expect that this improvement in our used vehicle inventory should mitigate the impact of the slower automotive retail selling season and challenging economic environment on our used vehicle performance 
in addition  we continue to focus on the growth of all used vehicle product offerings including factory certified  traditional and cash cars

the million increase in fixed operations revenues and million increase in fixed operations gross profit was primarily due to a and increase in our customer pay parts and service revenue and gross profit  respectively 
we continue to experience decreases in our warranty business as warranty revenue and gross profit decreased million and million  respectively  as a result of improvements in the quality of vehicles produced in recent years  which has decreased our warranty repair work 
as a result  we have focused on our customer pay business and expect our fixed operations sales to continue to grow as we i continue to invest in additional service capacity  ii upgrade equipment  iii improve customer retention and customer satisfaction  iv capitalize on our regional training programs and v add service advisors and skilled technicians to meet anticipated future demand  especially from the increased market share of the luxury import and mid line import brands 
in addition  we expect to recognize improved fixed operations gross profit in the future from heavy trucks as a result of the addition of service capacity and as the customers who purchased vehicles prior to the emission law changes begin to bring their vehicles in for maintenance and repairs

these factors were partially offset by a increase in floor plan interest expense as a result of a basis point increase in short term interest rates 
the billion increase in total revenue was primarily a result of a billion increase in new vehicle revenue and a billion increase in used vehicle revenue 
the increase in new vehicle revenue was a result of a million increase in heavy truck revenue and a million increase in same store new retail revenue from our mid line import brands  partially offset by a million decrease in same store new retail revenue from our mid line domestic brands

the net change in floor plan notes payable to a party affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase new vehicles is classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions are classified as a financing activity 
cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory while the latter are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory 
floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and all floor plan providers require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid immediately after that vehicle is sold 
as a result  we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors ie  if our competitors have a different mix of manufacturer affiliated and non manufacturer affiliated floor plan as compared to us 
in addition  we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our operating cash flow forecasts 
as a result  we use adjusted cash flow from operating activities to compare our results to forecasts 
we believe that by splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities while all inventory activity is included in operating activities results in significantly different operating cash flow than when all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable are classified together in operating activities

table of contents application of critical accounting estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting estimates described below are those that require management judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
f i chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts  credit life insurance and disability insurance to customers 
in addition  we receive commissions from financing institutions for arranging customer financing 
we may be charged back chargebacks for finance  insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event a contract is terminated 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time the vehicles are sold and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
our loss histories vary depending on the product but generally range between and 
our f i chargebacks for the years ending december   and were million  million and million  respectfully 
our chargeback reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a change in our estimate for all our products would have changed our finance and insurance  net by approximately million used vehicle inventory lower of cost or market reserve our used vehicle inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method to value our vehicle inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
in assessing lower of cost or market for used vehicles  we consider i the aging of used vehicles  ii loss histories of used vehicles and iii current market conditions 
our used vehicle loss histories have indicated that our losses range between of our used vehicle inventory 
our used vehicle losses for the years ending december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our used vehicle loss reserve was million or of used vehicle inventory 
each change in our estimate would change our used vehicle reserve approximately million 
insurance reserves we are self insured for certain employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for individual claims 
we have large deductible insurance programs in place for workers compensation  property and general liability claims 
we maintain and review at least monthly our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our future liability for these claims 
we also use professional service providers such as account administrators and actuaries to help us accumulate and assess this information 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of insurance reserves for both known and unknown employee medical  workers compensation  property and general liability claims 
insurance losses for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights goodwill represents the excess cost of the businesses acquired over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets 
we have determined that  based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business  how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another  and the fact that all components are economically similar  we qualify as a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
our dealership general managers are responsible for customer facing activities  including inventory management and advertising and personnel decisions  and have the flexibility to respond to local market conditions 
the corporate management team  with input from the regional management teams  is responsible for infrastructure and general strategy decisions 
the fair market value of our manufacturer franchise rights is determined at the acquisition date through discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise 
we have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no legal  contractual  economic or other factors that limit their useful 
table of contents lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names 
due to the fact that manufacturer franchise rights are specific to the location in which we acquire a dealership  we have determined that the dealership is the reporting unit for purposes of testing franchise rights for impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually on october st of each year  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in fair market value of our individual franchises or to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of our automotive retail business 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets are estimated future cash flows  present value discount rate  and other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluations of long lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to the testing above  which is done on an annual basis  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable  such as i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in the cash flow of an entity or inability of an entity to improve its operations to forecasted levels and ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological  that could affect the value of an entity 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  commonly referred to as minority interest 
among other matters  sfas requires a the noncontrolling interest be reported within equity in the balance sheet and b the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest to be clearly presented in the statement of income 
sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year 
sfas is to be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not impact our consolidated financial statements as we do not have any minority interests in our subsidiaries 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r business combinations  sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination  recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  and determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect the adoption of sfas r to decrease our other operating income expense  net by approximately million to million per acquisition 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no

eitf issue no

the amount recognized in apic should be included in the apic pool 
when an entity s estimate of forfeitures increases or actual forfeitures exceed its estimates  the amount of tax benefits previously recognized in apic should be reclassified into the income statement  however  the amount reclassified is limited to the apic pool balance on the reclassification date 
eitf issue no

to have a material financial impact to our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
provides guidance for  among other things  the definition of fair value and the methods used to measure fair value 
the provisions of sfas no

table of contents in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties and disclosure 
on january   we adopted fin the initial application of fin to our tax positions had no impact on shareholders equity 
we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin reconciliation of non gaap financial information the following operating performance measures i cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted  ii dealership generated f i gross profit pvr  iii adjusted sg a expenses as a percentage of adjusted gross profit and iv adjusted income from continuing operations  are not measures of operating performance under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap profitability measures such as cash provided by operating activities  f i gross profit pvr  sg a as percentage of gross profit and income from continuing operations 
these non gaap operating performance measures have material limitations and as a result should be evaluated in conjunction with the directly comparable gaap measure 
one limitation is that these non gaap measures are not defined by gaap and our definition of each measure may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
other limitations of these non gaap measures are discussed below 
in order to compensate for these limitations we also review the related gaap measures 
investors should not consider the non gaap measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap 
adjusted cash provided by used in operating borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a party unaffiliated with the manufacturer of a particular new vehicle  and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles  are classified as financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows with borrowings reflected separately from repayments 
the net change in floor plan notes payable to a party affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase new vehicles is classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions are classified as a financing activity 
cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory while the latter are cash flows related to amounts payable to a lender not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory 
no other differences exist 
floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and all floor plan providers require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid immediately after that vehicle is sold 
as a result  we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors ie  if our competitors have a different mix of manufacturer affiliated and non manufacturer affiliated floor plan as compared to us 
in addition  we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our operating cash flow forecasts 
as a result  we use adjusted cash flow from operating activities to compare our results to forecasts 
we believe that by splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities while all inventory activity is included in operating activities results in significantly different operating cash flow than when all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable are classified together in operating activities 
the non gaap measure cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted have material limitations 
cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted includes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the manufacturer of the related vehicle and conversely cash used in provided by financing activities  as adjusted  excludes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the manufacturer of the related vehicle 
in addition  the non gaap measure cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
in order to compensate for these limitations we also review the related gaap measures 

table of contents cash used in provided by financing activities  as adjusted  is not presented as a measure of our performance  financial position or cash flows 
we present this figure solely to show the source of the amount stated as floor plan notes payable non manufacturer affiliated in our reconciliation of adjusted cash provided by used in operating activities 
we have provided a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities and financing activities  as if all changes in floor plan notes payable  except for i borrowings associated with acquisitions and repayments associated with divestitures and ii borrowings and repayments associated with the purchase of used vehicle inventory  were classified as an operating activity

during  we renegotiated a contract with one of our third party f i product providers  which resulted in the recognition of income that was not attributable to retail vehicles sold during the year 
we believe that dealership generated f i  which excludes the additional revenue derived from contracts negotiated by our corporate office  provides a measure of our f i operating performance as used by management to operate the business 
however  this non gaap measure has material limitations including the fact that although we believe the recognition of corporate generated f i gross profit is infrequent and that we do not expect to recognize corporate generate f i gross profit in the future  we cannot assure you that we will not recognize similar amounts of f i gross profit in the future 
in order to compensate for these limitations we also review the related gaap measures

the non gaap measures adjusted gross profit contains material limitations 
although we believe that corporate generated f i gross profit is infrequent and although we do not expect to recognize this item in the future we cannot assure you that this type of item will not recur in the future 
in addition  our gross profit may not be comparable with gross profit of other companies to the extent that other companies recognize similar items in gross profit and do not provide disclosure of the amounts

we believe that an alternative comparison of our income from continuing operations  as used by management to compare actual results to forecasted results  can be made by adjusting for these items based on the fact that we believe these items are not core dealership operating items and should not be considered when forecasting our future results 
the non gaap measures adjusted income from continuing operations contain material limitations

although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
hedging risk in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million as a hedge against the changes in interest rates of our variable rate floor plan notes payable for a period of two years beginning in november the swap agreement was designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge of future changes in interest rates of our variable rate floor plan notes payable and is not expected to contain any ineffectiveness
