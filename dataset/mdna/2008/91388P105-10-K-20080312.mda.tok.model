item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a primarily non asset based provider of transportation services to shippers throughout the united states and in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 
we offer flatbed and dry van trucking services  as well as rail truck and steamship truck intermodal and truck brokerage services 
we primarily operate through a contractor network of independent sales agents and owner operators of tractors and trailers 
in return for their services  we pay our agents and owner operators a percentage of the revenue they generate for us 
our owner operators provided us with approximately  tractors and approximately  trailers  which represented substantially all of the tractors and over of the trailers used in our business 
our use of agents and owner operators reduces our need to provide non driver facilities and tractor and trailer fleets 
the primary physical assets we provide to our agents and owner operators include a portion of our trailer fleet  our headquarters facility  our management information systems and our intermodal depot facilities 
our business model provides us with a highly variable cost structure  allows us to grow organically using relatively small amounts of cash  gives us a higher return on assets compared to many of our asset based competitors and preserves an entrepreneurial spirit among our agents and owner operators that we believe leads to improved operating performance 
in  approximately  of our total operating expenses were variable in nature 
our capital expenditures for were million 
in  our return on average assets was 
over the past six years  our operating revenues have increased to million in from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
our net income has increased to million in from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
we have achieved this growth through a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions of companies that complement our non asset based business model  as well as companies that derive a portion of their revenues from asset based operations 
we believe that our willingness to expand our business to include a portion of asset based operations will expand the universe of potential acquisition targets  as most companies that we consider acquiring use a combination of asset based and non asset based operations 
we also intend to continue our organic growth  primarily by recruiting new agents and increasing the productivity of our existing agents 
we believe that increasing our agent network is critical to our ability to penetrate new shipping markets and also to expand our network of owner operators

revenues and expenses operating revenues 
we generate substantially all of our revenues through fees charged to customers for the transportation of freight 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  container storage and other services 
our revenue growth has been primarily driven by increases in the volume of freight shipped 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
the main factors that affect our shipping rates are competition  available truck capacity  and economic market conditions 
we recognize our revenues at the time of delivery to the receiver s location 
purchased transportation 
purchased transportation represents the amount we pay our owner operators or other third party equipment providers to haul freight and includes the amount of fuel surcharges that we pass through to our owner operators 
the amount of the purchased transportation we pay to our owner operators is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of our revenue for each load hauled 
purchased transportation is the largest component of our costs and increases or decreases proportionately with changes in the amount of revenue generated by our owner operators and other third party providers 
we recognize purchased transportation expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
commissions expense 
commissions expense represents the amount we pay our agents for generating shipments on our behalf 
the commissions we pay to our agents are generally established through informal oral agreements and are based on a percentage of revenue generated by each load hauled 
traditionally  commissions increase or decrease in proportion to the revenues generated through our agents 
we recognize commission expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
other operating expense 
other operating expenses represent the repair  tires and parts expenses primarily related to the maintenance of company owned leased trailers and lift equipment  and operating taxes and licenses  net of the rental income we receive from leasing our trailers to our owner operators 
we recognize these expenses as they are incurred and the rental income as it is earned 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
employee compensation and benefits historically have accounted for over of our selling  general and administrative expense 
other components of selling  general and administrative expense include customer bad debt allowance  communications and rent expense 
insurance and claims 
insurance and claims expense represents our insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
our insurance premiums are generally calculated based on the size of our tractor fleet 
our accruals have primarily related to cargo and property damage claims 
we may also make accruals for personal injuries and property damage to third parties  physical damage to our equipment  and workers compensation claims if we experience a claim in excess of our insurance coverage 
to reduce our exposure to non trucking use liability claims claims incurred while the vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo  we require our owner operators to maintain non trucking use liability coverage  which we refer to as deadhead bobtail coverage  of million per occurrence 
our exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party providers who haul freight on our behalf is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
our insurance expense varies primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  the market for insurance  our coverage limits and our self insured retention amounts 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the depreciation of trailers  management information services equipment  buildings and equipment 
on january   we revised the estimated salvage value of our trailers 
previously we estimated that trailers had no salvage value at the end of their useful life of seven years 
however  based on our evaluation of the current market conditions for used trailers  we estimate that our trailers will have a salvage value equal to of their original cost 
as a result  the estimated salvage value for all trailers owned as of january  has been revised to equal of their original cost 
additionally for any trailers acquired after january  we will use an estimated salvage value of of their original costs

we employ a primarily non asset based operating strategy 
substantially all of the tractors and more than of the trailers utilized in our business are provided by our owner operators and we have no capital expenditure requirements relating to this equipment

we accrue for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we use judgment and evaluate  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by us  we would have to record a charge for the matter  generally in the full amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position for the period 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  operating revenues and operating expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
management continuously monitors these factors to arrive at the estimate of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators 
past due balances over days and over  are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates 
changes in the facts and circumstances that these estimates are based upon and changes in the general economic environment could result in a material change to the allowance for uncollectible receivables 
these changes include  but are not limited to  deterioration of customers financial position  changes in our relationships with our customers  agents and owner operators and unforeseen issues relating to individual receivables 
insurance and claim costs we maintain auto liability  workers compensation and general liability insurance with licensed insurance carriers 
we are self insured for all cargo and equipment damage claims 
insurance and claims expense represents premiums paid by us and the accruals made for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
a liability is recognized for the estimated cost of all self insured claims including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and for claims expected to exceed the our policy limits 
in addition  we are responsible for all of the legal expenses related to claims 

table of contents as of december   we did not have any reserves for workers compensation or general liability claims 
we do establish reserves for anticipated losses and expenses related to cargo and equipment damage claims and auto liability claims 
the reserves consist of specific reserves for all known claims and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported  and losses arising from known claims ultimately settling in excess of insurance coverage using loss development factors based upon industry data and past experience 
in determining the reserves  we specifically review all known claims and record a liability based upon our best estimate of the amount to be paid 
in making our estimate  we consider the amount and validity of the claim  as well as our past experience with similar claims 
in establishing the reserve for claims incurred but not reported  we consider our past claims history  including the length of time it takes for claims to be reported to us 
based on our past experience  the time between when a claim occurs and when it is reported to us is short 
as a result  we believe that the number of incurred but not reported claims at any given point in time is small 
these reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect our experience and updated information relating to specific claims 
if we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our estimated claim reserve  it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of depreciation and amortization of long lived assets is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we also evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment by analyzing the operating performance and anticipated future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the need to adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
our projection of future cash flows  the level of actual cash flows  the methods of estimation used for determining fair values and salvage values can impact impairment 
any changes in management s judgments could result in greater or lesser annual depreciation and amortization expense or impairment charges in the future

included in marketable securities is million in short term investment grade instruments 
the interest rates on these instruments are adjusted to market rates at least monthly 
accordingly  any future interest rate risk on these short term investments would not be material 
we did not have any interest rate swap agreements as of december  commodity price risk fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability by affecting our ability to retain or recruit owner operators 
our owner operators bear the costs of operating their tractors  including the cost of fuel 
the tractors operated by our owner operators consume large amounts of diesel fuel 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political and other factors beyond our control 
to address fluctuations in fuel prices  we seek to impose fuel surcharges on our customers and pass these surcharges on to our owner operators 
historically  these arrangements have not fully protected our owner operators from fuel price increases 
if costs for fuel escalate significantly it could make it more difficult to attract additional qualified owner operators and retain our current owner operators 
if we lose the services of a significant number of owner operators or are unable to attract additional owner operators  it could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
