our objective is to continue to increase our sales in the major print markets in the united states 
we intend to hire or acquire more account executives within close proximity to these large markets  which accounted for  in aggregate  billion of print expenditures in  according to printing industries of america graphic arts technical foundation 
in addition  given that the print industry is a global business  over time we intend to evaluate opportunities to access attractive markets outside the united states 
for example  in march we entered into a strategic agreement to grant snp corporation ltd 
a non exclusive  non transferable license to use certain non core applications of our software in china  singapore and hong kong 
we acquired spectrum printing services in march  brown partners  inc in july  data flow media systems  lp  graphic resource group in october and corporate edge  inc in november our results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of operations from spectrum from march   brown partners from july   data flow media systems and graphic resource group from october  and corporate edge from december  recent developments in march  we acquired spectrum printing services  a provider of print management services as well as promotional products  apparel and complete warehousing and fulfillment services 
as a result of the acquisition  we established a strategic presence in the southern california print market and added five additional sales executives and their corresponding production teams 
the acquisition consideration for spectrum printing services consisted of approximately million in cash paid in and up to an additional million subject to spectrum printing services achieving specified ebitda targets in and in july  we acquired brown partners  inc  a provider of print management services based in suburban philadelphia 
the acquisition price consisted of approximately  in cash paid in july and up to an additional million in cash payable contingent on the achievement of certain performance measures by brown partners  inc prior to december  in october  we acquired graphic resource group  inc  a provider of print management services which include the procurement and production management of printed products  located in minneapolis 
the acquisition purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash paid in october and up to an additional million subject to graphic resource group achieving specified ebitda targets through september  in october  we acquired data flow media systems  lp  a provider of print management services which includes the procurement and production management of printed and promotional products and related warehousing and fulfillment functions  located in dallas  texas 
the acquisition purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash paid in the fourth quarter of and up to an additional million subject to data flow media systems achieving specified ebitda targets through september  in december  we acquired corporate edge  inc  a national distributor of promotional products principally involved in the design  development and sale of corporate specialty items with locations in new york and new jersey 
as a result of the acquisition  we expanded our strategic presence in the new york area print market and added twenty seven sales executives and their corresponding production teams 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  which was paid in december in addition  the former owners of corporate edge may receive up to million in cash payable contingent on the achievement of certain performance measures by corporate edge prior to november  revenue we generate revenue through the sale of printed products to our clients 
our revenue was  and million in  and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and transactional 
enterprise jobs usually involve higher dollar amounts and volume than our transactional jobs 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of printing services on a recurring basis  if the client has signed an open ended purchase order  or a series of related purchase orders  or if the client has enrolled in our e stores program  which enables the client to make online purchases of printing services on a recurring basis 
we categorize all other clients as transactional 
we enter into contracts with our enterprise clients to provide some or a specific portion of their printed products on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients generally have an open ended term subject to termination by either party upon prior notice ranging from days to twelve months 
several of our enterprise clients have outsourced substantially all of their recurring print needs to us 
we provide printed products to our transactional clients on an order by order basis 
as of december   we had enterprise clients  and as of december  we had enterprise clients 
from our inception through december   we have served over  clients 
for the years ended december  and  enterprise clients accounted for and of our revenue  respectively  while transactional clients accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
our revenue consists of the prices paid by our clients for printed products 
these prices  in turn  reflect the amounts charged to us by our suppliers plus our gross profit 
our gross profit margin  in the case of some of our enterprise clients  is fixed by contract or  in the case of transactional clients  is negotiated on a job by job basis 
once either type of client accepts our pricing terms  the selling price is established and we procure the product for our own account in order to re sell it to the client 
we take full title and risk of loss for the product upon shipment 
the finished product is typically shipped directly from our supplier to a destination specified by our client 
upon shipment  our supplier invoices us for its production costs and we invoice our client 
because we have made several acquisitions in recent years  comparing our revenue results from year to year is complex 
in an effort to make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods  we are providing revenue information on the current year acquisitions 
during  we made six strategic acquisitions  including spectrum printing services  brown partners  inc  inkchasers  data flow media systems  lp  graphic resource group  inc and corporate edge  inc adding these operations to our existing business contributed million of revenue in our revenue from enterprise clients tends to generate lower gross profit margins than our revenue from transactional clients because the gross profit margins established in our contracts with large enterprise clients are generally lower than the gross profit margins we typically realize in our transactional business 
although our enterprise revenue generates lower gross profit margins  our enterprise business tends to be more profitable than our transactional business on an operating profit basis because the commission expense associated with enterprise jobs is generally lower 
the print industry has historically been subject to seasonal sales fluctuations because a substantial number of print orders are placed for the year end holiday season 
we have historically experienced seasonal client buying patterns with a higher percentage of our revenue being earned in our third and fourth quarters 
we expect these seasonal revenue patterns to continue 
cost of goods sold and gross profit our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the price at which we purchase products from our suppliers 
our selling price  including our gross profit  in the case of some of our enterprise jobs  is based on a fixed gross margin established by contract or  in the case of transactional jobs  is determined at the discretion of the account executive or procurement manager within predetermined parameters 
our gross margins on our enterprise jobs are typically lower than our gross margins on our transactional jobs 
as a result  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for our enterprise jobs is typically higher than those for our transactional jobs 
our gross profit for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
we have early payment discount terms with several of our key suppliers 
we have taken advantage of early payment terms on a more frequent basis in recent periods  thereby reducing our overall cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses and income from operations commissions paid to our account executives are a significant component of our operating expenses 
the commissions we pay to our account executives are based on the gross profit we collect from the clients 
as a percentage of revenue  commissions were  and in  and  respectively 
commission expense generally fluctuates based on the gross profit of the business 
as the overall gross margin increased in to  up from in  commission expense increased as well 
this is a result of on an increase in business with transactional business up from in to in we accrue for commissions when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our account executives receive a monthly draw to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
the cash paid to our account executives in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our account executives earn commissions  a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our prepaid commission balance was million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  our general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation costs for our procurement managers and management team 
our general and administrative expenses also include compensation costs for our finance and support employees  corporate systems  accounting  legal  facilities and travel and entertainment expenses 
in and  we also incurred public company fees and expenses  including consulting fees for the implementation of sarbanes oxley and the expense to maintain directors and officers liability insurance 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is due in large part to the addition of key personnel to sustain the infrastructure of our growing business  new personnel from acquisitions and expenses related to becoming sarbanes oxley complaint 
we agree to provide our clients with printed products that conform to the industry standard of a commercially reasonable quality  and our suppliers in turn agree to provide us with products of the same quality 
in addition  the quotes we execute with our clients include customary industry terms and conditions that limit the amount of our liability for product defects 
product defects have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are required to make payment to our suppliers for completed print jobs regardless of whether our clients make payment to us 
to date  the failure of our clients to make required payments has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our bad debt expense was approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
our income from operations for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from a third party to the customer  which is when title transfers 
in accordance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we recognize revenue on a gross basis  as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement  because we bear the risks and benefits associated with revenue generated activities by acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  being responsible for fulfillment of the order  taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and marketing our products  among other things 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identified assets of businesses acquired 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step  the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed  which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
as of december   our goodwill balance was million 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators exist in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our intangible assets consist of customer lists  trade names  and non compete agreements with account executives and are amortized on the straight line basis 
we believe the customer lists have ten to fifteen year useful lives  and we are amortizing the non compete agreements over the terms of the agreements 
as of december   the net balance of our intangible assets was million 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and complied with the disclosure requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  share based payments  using the prospective transition method and black scholes as the option valuation model 
under the prospective transition method  we will continue to account for non vested equity awards outstanding at the date of adopting statement r in the same manner as they had been accounted for prior to adoption 
as a result  under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the grant date between the estimated fair value of our stock and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock 
the compensation expense is then amortized over the vesting period of the stock options 
between january  and december   we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the estimated per share fair value of the shares underlying these option grants ranged from to 
between january  and december   we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the estimated per share fair value of the shares underlying these option grants ranged from to 
between january  and december   we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in august  we engaged an independent valuation specialist to perform a retrospective valuation of our common stock as of november  on september   the valuation specialist delivered a report stating that the fair value of our common stock as of november  was per share 
shortly after our receipt of the report  we used the valuation specialist s methodology to determine that the fair value of our common stock as of june  was per share 
in  we used the valuation specialist s methodology to determine that the fair value of our common stock as of december  was per share 
based on these determinations  we established an exercise price of no less than per share for the options granted between june  and december  using the valuation specialist s methodology  we valued our business as of june  and december  by calculating the present value of our future available cash flows at an appropriate rate 
for purposes of estimating our future available cash flows  we made significant assumptions with respect to revenue growth rates  forecasted net income and debt free future cash flow 
we applied a rate to calculate the present value of our future available cash flows based on the independent valuation specialist s determination that we were in our second stage  or expansion stage  of development 
we also applied a lack of marketability discount to our enterprise value  which took into account the fact that minority investments in private companies are less liquid than similar investments in publicly traded companies 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
we accounted for these options granted prior to january  in accordance with apb opinion no 
the exercise price of all of the options that we granted during this period was at or above fair market value 
as a result  there was no intrinsic value associated with these option grants 
pursuant to apb opinion no 
 we were not required to record any compensation expense in connection with these option grants 
effective january   we calculate compensation expense under sfas no 
r based on the black scholes value of options at the time of grant and record compensation expense in equal amounts as the options vest 
during  we granted options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
the exercise price to purchase these shares was based on the market closing price on the grant date  which ranged from to 
we estimated the black scholes value of these options using the following assumptions expected volatility  risk free interest rates ranging from to  and expected life years 
on march   we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the estimated per share fair value of our common stock on the date of this option grant was 
the basis for determining the estimated per share fair value was the contemporaneous arm s length negotiation of a transaction involving the sale of certain shares of our common stock to snp 
we estimated the black scholes value of these options using the following assumptions expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life years  exercise price per share  and fair market value per share 
on may  june and july   we granted options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
the exercise price of the options to purchase  shares of our common stock that we granted on may  was per share  which was the price per share paid by snp in april on june   the same valuation specialist that we engaged in august delivered a report stating that the fair value of our common stock as of may  was per share 
we used this value as the exercise price of the options to purchase  shares of our common stock that we granted on june  and july  we also used this as the estimated per share fair value of our common stock on the dates of option grant and the may  option grant 
we estimated the black scholes value of these options using the following assumptions expected volatility  risk free interest rate   and  respectively  expected life years  exercise price per share or per share  as applicable  and fair market value per share 
on august  october  and november  we granted options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
as these options were issued subsequent to the initial public offering  the exercise price to purchase these shares was based on the market closing price on the grant date  which was   and  respectively 
we estimated the black scholes value of these options using the following assumptions expected volatility  risk free interest rate   and  respectively  and expected life years 
we recorded share based compensation expense of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   and there were  and  options to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding 
of these outstanding options   were vested and  were unvested as of december  and  were vested and  were unvested as of december  we believe that the per share fair value of our common stock increased from as of december  to as of august   the date of the initial public offering  as a result of several developments 
the following developments  among others  were unexpected as of december  and therefore not considered in the estimate of the per share fair value from january  to april   six fortune companies became enterprise clients 
the addition of enterprise agreements and the prospect of additional capital from the initial public offering increased our revenue projections 
from january  to april   our revenue increased more than from the prior comparable period 
in january  we completed a series e preferred round of financing at a purchase price of per share  which provided million of working capital 
in april  we entered into a strategic alliance with snp to license a portion of our technology 
this alliance included the sale of our common stock to snp at a purchase price of per share 
on may   we acquired graphography limited llc  a provider of production management services  including print procurement and promotional services 
in  graphography generated revenue of million  representing of our pro forma revenue 
as a result of the acquisition  we established a significant presence in the new york market  which is the third largest print market in the united states 
graphography added two new significant enterprise clients  a fortune manufacturing and marketing company and a multi billion dollar international beverage distributor  each of which would have been in our top five accounts based on revenue generated in on a pro forma basis 
it also added more than transactional clients  which expanded our pipeline of clients to which market our enterprise solution 
in addition  we gained approximately new suppliers that provide printing and promotional services to our existing clients 
we also acquired three additional sales executives as well as two additional lead production managers  and their corresponding production teams  with significant expertise in the areas of direct mail and promotional products 
the acquisition enabled us to populate our proprietary database with over  historical graphography print jobs and quotes  increasing the size of our ppm database by over and enhancing our ability to identify optional pricing for our clients

substantially all of our auction rate securities are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education  and all were rated aaa aaa as of december  we continue to believe that the credit quality of these securities is high 
while the recent auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures or other business requirements

other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  eg  debt issue costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of we are currently determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of our eligible items and cannot estimate the impact  if any  which sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are dependent upon the availability of paper and paper prices represent a substantial portion of the cost of our products 
the supply and price of paper depends on a variety of factors over which we have no control  including environmental and conservation regulations  natural disasters and weather 
assuming we were unable to pass along price increases in paper to our customers  there would be a risk of margin erosion on future business 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our line of credit 
the interest rate on our line of credit fluctuates based on the prime rate 
assuming the million line of credit was fully drawn  a increase in the prime rate would increase our annual interest expense by  the million line of credit  effective july   has a term of one year and will mature on june  the line of credit was unused as of december  the maximum amount outstanding under our line of credit cannot exceed of the book value of our eligible accounts receivable 
our line of credit contains limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens and make certain investments 
advances made under our line of credit accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  in particular because all of our investments are in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the average duration of all of our investments as of december  was less than three months 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes
