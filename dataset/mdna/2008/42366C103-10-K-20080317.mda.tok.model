a 
was dissolved as of december our current strategic focus is derived from four applications of our two core pharmaceutical technology platforms ampligen and alferon n injection 
the commercial focus for ampligen includes application as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome cfs and as a vaccine enhancer adjuvant for both therapeutic and preventative vaccine development 
alferon n injection is an fda approved product with an indication for refractory or recurring genital warts 
alferon ldo low dose oral is an application currently under early stage development targeting influenza and viral diseases both as an adjuvant as well as a single entity anti viral 
ampligen is an experimental drug currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs or cfs  and hiv 
in august  we completed a phase iii clinical trial amp treating over me cfs patients with ampligen and are presently in the registration process for a new drug application nda with the food and drug administration fda 
over its developmental history  ampligen has received various designations  including orphan drug product designation fda  emergency compassionate cost recovery sales authorization fda and promising clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports ahrq  agency health research quality 
an nda for treatment of cfs was filed on october  on december  a refusal to file rtf letter was received because the application was deemed not substantially complete 
a written response was developed and submitted to the fda addressing pre clinical and clinical questions 
ampligen represents the first drug in class of rna nucleic acid molecules to apply for nda review 
the status of our initiative for ampligen as an adjuvant for preventative vaccine development includes pre clinical studies in seasonal and pandemic influenza for intranasal administration being conducted by japan s national institute for infectious diseases 
a three year program targeting regulatory approval for pandemic flu and seasonal flu in japan has been funded by the japanese ministry of health 
parties to the research grant include hemispherx  the niid and biken non profit operational arm of the foundation for microbial disease of osaka university 
our agreement with biken is part of a three party agreement to develop an effective influenza vaccine for japan and utilizes the resources of the national institute of infectious disease of japan 
our development strategy includes reproduction of preclinical studies outside japan and completion of the three year program 
we intend to conduct human studies in the us and seek approval for seasonal and pandemic indications in the us and europe for intranasal administration 
a phase ii study for intramuscular administration for seasonal flu has been initiated in australia through the st 
vincent s hospital clinical trials centre 
with regard to ampligen as a therapeutic vaccine adjuvant  we intend to initiate pre clinical studies in hiv and various cancers and plan to ultimately negotiate a vaccine development licensing agreement 
based on the results of published  peer reviewed pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we believe that ampligen may have broad spectrum anti viral and anti cancer properties 
over patients have participated in ampligen clinical trials authorized by the fda at over twenty clinical trial sites across the us  representing the administration of more than  doses of this drug 
alferon n injection is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon  which is approved by the fda for the treatment of genital warts 
alferon n injection is also in clinical development for treating west nile virus 
other preclinical development with respect to multiple sclerosis and sars has been suspended due to the resource requirements of other projects 
we are actively engaged in broad based ongoing experimental studies assessing the efficacy of our products ampligen  alferon n injection  and alferon ldo against influenza viruses as an adjuvant and or single agent antiviral with the defence r d canada  the national institute of infectious diseases in tokyo  the st 
vincent s hospital clinical trial centre in australia and various research affiliates of the national institutes of health in the united states 
we own and operate a  sq 
ft 
fda approved facility in new brunswick  nj primarily designed to produce alferon n 
in  we completed the installation of a polymer production line to produce ampligen raw materials on a more reliable and consistent basis 
we outsource certain components of our research and development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution while maintaining control over the entire process through our quality assurance group and our clinical monitoring group

our products our primary products consist of our experimental compound  ampligen  our fda approved natural interferon product  alferon n injection and alferon ldo low dose oral our experimental liquid natural interferon for oral administration 
ampligen nucleic acid compounds represent a potential new class of pharmaceutical products that are designed to act at the molecular level for treatment of human diseases 
there are two forms of nucleic acids  dna and rna 
dna is a group of naturally occurring molecules found in chromosomes  the cell s genetic machinery 
rna is a group of naturally occurring informational molecules which orchestrate a cell s behavior which regulates the action of groups of cells  including the cells which compromise the body s immune system 
rna directs the production of proteins and regulates certain cell activities including the activation of an otherwise dormant cellular defense against viruses and tumors 
our drug technology utilizes specifically configured rna 
our double stranded rna drug product  trademarked ampligen  an experimental  unapproved drug  which is administered intravenously  is in human clinical development for various therapeutically oriented studies  including treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome myalgic encephalomyelitis cfs me  hiv  renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma 
clinical trials already conducted by us include treatments of me cfs  hepatitis b  hiv  and cancer patients with renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma 
certain of these will require additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval 
the fda has approved the use of ampligen in treating me cfs on an emergency basis ie those with immediate life threatening illnesses 
this is known as a treatment ind  or treatment investigational new drug 
furthermore  the fda has granted hemispherx orphan drug status in the united states 
orphan drugs get seven years of market exclusivity upon fda approval 
alferon n injection interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases 
researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon alpha  beta  gamma and omega 
the alferon n injection product contains a multi species form of alpha interferon 
the worldwide market for injectable alpha interferon based products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide 
alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways by genetic engineering  by cell culture  and from human white blood cells 
all three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the us our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells 
the potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant synthetic interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions 
natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon 
in contrast  recombinant alpha interferon each contain only a single species 
researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus 
natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species  which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies 
natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated partially covered with sugar molecules 
such glycosylation is not present on the currently us marketed recombinant alpha interferons 
we believe that the absence of glycosylation may be  in part  responsible for the production of interferon neutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon 
although cell culture derived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species  the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon 
the fda approved alferon n injection in for the intralesional within lesions treatment of refractory resistant to other treatment or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older 
certain types of human papillomaviruses hpv cause genital warts  a sexually transmitted disease std 
a published report estimates that approximately eight million new and recurrent causes of genital warts occur annually in the united states alone 
alferon n injection 
interferon alfa n human leukocyte derived 
is a highly purified  natural source  glycosylated  multi species alpha interferon product 
there are essentially no antibodies observed against natural interferon to date and the product has a relatively low side effect profile 
alferon is the only natural source  multi species alpha interferon currently sold in the us the recombinant dna derived alpha interferon are now reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year  probably due to antibody formation and other severe toxicities 
these detrimental effects have not been reported with the use of alferon n injection which could allow this product to assume a much larger market share 
it is our belief that the use of alferon n in combination with ampligen has the potential to increase the positive therapeutic responses in chronic life threatening viral diseases 
we have suspended certain preclinical trials for various viral disorders at this time due to funding considerations and increased resource requirements of other projects 
alferon low dose oral ldo alferon ldo is an experimental low dose  oral liquid formulation of natural alpha interferon and like alferon n injection should not cause antibody formation  which is a problem with recombinant interferon 
it is an experimental immunotherapeutic believed to work by stimulating an immune cascade response in the cells of the mouth and throat  enabling it to bolster systemic immune response through the entire body by absorption through the oral mucosa 
oral interferon would be much more economically feasible for patients and logistically manageable in development programs in third world countries primarily affected by hiv and other emerging viruses sars  ebola  bird flu  etc oral administration of alferon n  with its affordability  low toxicity  no production of antibodies  and broad range of potential bio activity  could be a breakthrough treatment for viral diseases 
we have initiated clinical trials as part of an accelerated evaluation of the experimental bio therapeutic alferon ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n human leukocyte derived as a potential new experimental therapy for avian flu and other lethal viral diseases  which have high acute death rates 
clinical trials in human volunteers conducted in both the us at drexel university  philadelphia and in hong kong at the princess margaret hospital were designed to determine whether alferon n  delivered in a new  experimental oral drug delivery format  can resuscitate the broad spectrum antiviral and immunostimulatory genes 
these human genes are shut down by acute lethal viral infections such as hiv  avian flu and smallpox 
the results of this study are being evaluated 
oragens we acquired a series of patents on oragens  potentially a set of oral broad spectrum antivirals and immunological enhancers  through a licensing agreement with temple university in philadelphia  pa 
we were granted an exclusive worldwide license from temple for the oragens products 
these compounds have been evaluated in various academic laboratories for application to chronic viral and immunological disorders 
the  oligoadenylate synthetase rnase l system is an important and widely distributed pathway for the inhibition of viral replication and tumor growth 
the  oligoadenylate synthetase  up activation by double stranded rna  synthesizes  oligoadenylates a from atp 
these bioactive as directly activate rnase l  which degrades viral and cellular rnas resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis 
the bioactive a molecules can be degraded by various hydrolytic enzymes  resulting in a short half life 
analogues of these bioactive as  termed oragen rna compounds  have been produced to increase stability and maintain or increase biological activity without demonstrable toxicity 
additional pre clinical tests will be conducted prior to pursuing clinical trials see research  consulting  licensing and supply agreements section of item i for more details on this license 
patents we have over patents worldwide with approximately additional pending patent applications pending comprising our intellectual property 
in  we obtained the global patent rights for a compound that enhances dna vaccination by the efficient intracellular delivery of immunogenic dna ie dna that can produce antigenic proteins that simulate an acute viral infection with a resultant umoral and cell mediated immune response 
see research  consulting  licensing and supply agreements section within item i for more information on the acquisition of these patents 
we continually review our patents rights to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans for ampligen  alferon n and other intellectual property 
we have been issued certain patents on the use of ampligen alone and ampligen in combination with certain other drugs including azt  ddi  ddc  interferon and or il  for the treatment of hiv 
our experimental compounds  which have yet to be determined safe and effective by regulatory authorities  are accordingly only available legally in certain authorized trials and tests  in vitro outside the body tests are also not necessarily indicative of any evidence of clinical benefits or advantages 
but the focus of hemispherx is on ampligen as a treatment for cfs me and hiv 
the main us me cfs treatment patent expires october  our main patents covering hiv treatment   and expired or will expire on april   november   and february   respectively  hepatitis treatment coverage is conveyed by us patent which expires on january  the us ampligen trademark  expires on december  and can be renewed thereafter for an additional years 
the fda has granted us orphan drug status for our nucleic acid derived therapeutics for me cfs  hiv  and renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma 
orphan drug status grants us protection against competition for a period of seven years following fda approval  as well as certain federal tax incentives  and other regulatory benefits 
patent coverage for the hiv indication following the expiration of patents  and will be covered under the marketing protection provided by the orphan drug designation for using ampligen to treat hiv 
patent pending application pct us was abandoned during the current period 
the us alferon patents expire february   and  and december  
research and development r d our focus is on developing drugs for use in treating viral and immune based chronic disorders and diseases such as me cfs  hiv  hpv  sars and west nile virus 
our current r d projects target treatment therapies for me cfs  hiv  hpv and other viral diseases  ie  avian seasonal influenza 
myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs chronic fatigue syndrome cfs  also known as chronic immune dysfunction syndrome cfids and  myalgic encephalomyelitis me is a serious and debilitating chronic illness and a major public health problem 
long misunderstood  under recognized  and under diagnosed  me cfs is now recognized by both the government and private sector as a major health problem  including the national institutes of health  us centers for disease control and prevention cdc  fda and social security administration  recognizes me cfs as one of the most common chronic illnesses of our time 
the cdc listed me cfs as a priority disease  causing severe health and financial problems for the patients  their family  and the community 
me cfs is endemic in the population  but occasionally seen in clusters suggesting an infectious basis 
a variety of immunological  endocrine  autonomic nervous system  and metabolic abnormalities have been documented 
a groundbreaking  community based study of me cfs by dr 
leonard jason was published in the archives of internal medicine in and showed a prevalence rate of of every  americans 
as many as  people nationwide suffer from cfs  significantly more than previously estimated by the cdc 
furthermore  of the patients with the illness are struggling without the benefit of medical diagnosis or treatment 
while me cfs strikes people of all age  racial  ethnic  and socioeconomic groups  it is most prevalent amongst women 
research has shown that me cfs is about three times as common in women as men  a rate similar to that of many autoimmune diseases  such as multiple sclerosis and lupus 
to put this into perspective  me cfs is over four times more common than hiv infection in women  and the rate of me cfs in women is considerably higher than a woman s lifetime risk of getting lung cancer as published by the cfids association of america 
the most common symptom of me cfs is incapacitating fatigue  which does not subside with rest 
many severe me cfs patients become completely disabled or totally bedridden and are afflicted with severe pain and mental confusion even at rest 
this debilitating tiredness is associated with flu like symptoms such as chills  fever  headache  sore throat  painful lymph nodes  muscle aches  weakness and joint pain 
diagnosis of me cfs is a time consuming and difficult process which is generally arrived at by excluding other illnesses with similar symptoms and comparing a patient s symptoms with the case definition 
overlapping symptoms can occur with several diseases  such as fibromyalgia  gulf war illnesses  and multiple chemical sensitivities 
many diseases have similar symptoms including lupus and lyme disease which so closely mimic me cfs that they need to be considered when making a diagnosis to rule them out 
the case definition for me cfs criteria calls for certain symptoms to be present along with fatigue that interferes with physical  mental  social  and educational activities 
both the fatigue and symptoms must have occurred for at least a six month period 
people with me cfs may experience many more than the symptoms named in the case definition  so knowledgeable physicians will take this fact into consideration when making a diagnosis after other possible reasons for symptoms have been ruled out 
the leading model of me cfs pathogenesis is thought to be rooted in abnormalities in the immune system and brain central nervous system  both of which affects and alters the function of the other 
because some cases of chronic fatigue begin with a flu like infection  several viruses have been studied as possible causes because all are relatively common in the general population  including human herpesvirus hhv and  retroviruses  epstein barr virus  enteroviruses  as well as  mycoplasmas  etc 
whilst  the etiology is likely to be caused by a collection of factors  including viral  hormonal  stress  and other triggers for the illness in genetically  environmentally or otherwise susceptible individuals and continues to be a subject of discussion 
most me cfs patients are treated symptomatically with traditional treatments geared toward treating symptoms of the disease  such as improving quality of sleep  reducing pain and treatment of depression 
clinically  a number of different therapeutic approaches have been pursued  but with no significant clinical success 
other viral diseases we are actively engaged in broad based experimental studies assessing the efficacy of our products  ampligen  alferon n injection and alferon ldo against influenza viruses as an adjuvant and or single agent antiviral with the defence r d canada  the national institute of infectious disease in tokyo  st 
vincent s hospital clinical trial centre in australia and various research affiliates of the national institutes of health in the united states 
in september  japan s national institute of infectious disease jniid initiated research on the co administration of jniid s hiv vaccine with our experimental tlr agonist a substance that binds to a specific receptor and triggers a host defense response in the cell and immune enhancer  ampligen 
this research is the result of earlier research suggesting a potential role for ampligen in boosting responses to certain vaccines designed to combat avian influenza bird flu as well as seasonal influenza viruses 
the objective of this research is to determine if ampligen can overcome the historical problem which has handicapped aids vaccine development  namely marginal immune response which undermines the potential of long lasting protection 
ampligen will be combined with hiv recombinant protein and administered via an intranasal route 
in  jniid published  in two peer reviewed journals  the results of their studies to evaluate the ability of current seasonal influenza vaccine to confer cross protection against highly pathogenic hn influenza bird flu virus in mice 
these studies indicate that  as a vaccine enhancer co administered with their seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine  ampligen helps induce a protective effect against hn influenza viruses 
as such  ampligen as a toll like receptor agonist may aid in overcoming the problems protecting against mutated strains of the hn virus and of limited supplies of hn virus vaccines 
additional studies to support this conclusion are planned 
in april  japan s ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw issued authorization to its national institute of infectious diseases approving their budget to advance studies indicating that an hn influenza vaccine co administered intranasally with hemispherx s experimental therapeutic  ampligen  protected against mutated strains of the virus and  further that  the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine co administered intranasally with ampligen maintained efficacy even when challenged with the hn influenza virus 
in june  we initiated a clinical trial in australia using ampligen in combination with seasonal flu vaccine 
this trial focuses on populations at risk for virulent cases of influenza  especially those over the age of years who historically may have weakened immune systems 
the australian clinical trial was prompted by the results from the pre clinical work conducted by the jniid see above 
thirty eight subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in this study  which will utilize a two dose ampligen regimen of mg per dose 
data on the first eight subjects is currently under review and enrollment of thirty additional subjects will recommence in march this study is being monitored by clinical network services pty 
ltd 
located in brisbane  australia 
the clinical trials center of st 
vincent s hospital  based in darlinghurst  australia  is conducting the trial 
prospective subjects will be screened to be included in the clinical trial 
the center for disease control and prevention reports that in the number of mosquito borne west nile virus wnv infections in the united states was up sharply over the same period in this increased infection rate has accelerated the enrollment of patients in our phase iib clinical trial using alferon n to treat wnv patients 
in lab studies  alferon n  a natural cocktail of eight alpha interferons  shows synergistic effects up to fold over recombinant interferons against pathogens such as wnv 
the phase iib clinical trial is a double blinded  randomized  multi center program under the direction of cornell university and weill cornell medical college new york hospital 
our direct research and development cost was  in   in and  in most of these expenditures relate to the development of our experimental drug  ampligen 
the costs in and reflect the costs of producing ampligen raw materials polymers and ampligen doses for use in stability and validation testing 
also includes the costs of preparing the nda for filing with the fda 
manufacturing we have a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington hollister stier  for the manufacturing of ampligen for a five year term ending in pursuant to the agreement we supply the key raw materials and hollister stier formulates and bottles ampligen 
hollister stier has completed five pilot manufacturing runs of ampligen for stability testing with one additional manufacturing run which was completed mid march the first three pilot runs were completed in january utilizing polymer raw material from ribotech our previous supplier of raw material 
the six month accelerated stability data on these three lots support a two year expiration period with additional test results forthcoming 
having successfully completed these manufacturing runs  the scale up of ampligen manufacturing to commercial batch size and the validation of the manufacturing at hollister stier was initiated 
the remaining two lots were run in january and february with the aforementioned third lot completed in mid march utilizing polymer raw material from our nj facility 
based on the available information from the completion of the first two commercial size manufacturing validation lots  we are using these three process validation lots in stability studies to monitor and confirm the product quality and stability 
alferon n injection  the purified drug concentrate utilized in the formulation of alferon n injection  was manufactured in our new brunswick  new jersey facility and was formulated and packaged at a production facility formerly owned and operated by abbott laboratories located in kansas 
abbott laboratories sold the facility to hospira 
hospira ceased the labeling and packaging of alferon n injection as they sought larger production runs for cost efficiency purposes 
on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient quantity and provide any pertinent information to the project 
hyaluron is in the process of preparing their facility to produce alferon n 
at this time we are in the process of scheduling additional production runs in marketing distribution we continue our efforts to establish an internal marketing and sales infrastructure to facilitate and refine our commercialization initiatives 
our marketing strategy for ampligen reflects the differing health care systems around the world  and the different marketing and distribution systems that are used to supply pharmaceutical products to those systems 
in the us  we expect that  subject to receipt of regulatory approval  ampligen may be utilized in four medical arenas physicians offices  clinics  hospitals and the home treatment setting 
we are in the process of developing pre launch and launch driven marketing plans focusing on those audience development  medical support and payor reimbursement initiatives which will facilitate product acceptance and utilization at the time of regulatory approval 
similarly  we are developing distribution scenarios for the specialty pharmacy infusion channel which will insure market access  offer pl third party logistics capabilities and provide the requisite risk management control mechanisms 
it is our intent to utilize third party service providers to execute elements of both the marketing sales and distribution plans 
we currently plan to utilize a small group of managed market account managers to introduce the product to payor  employer and government account audiences 
we believe that this approach will establish a market presence and facilitate the generation of revenue without incurring the substantial costs associated with a traditional sales force 
furthermore  management believes that the approach will enable us to retain many options for future marketing strategies 
for example  our commercialization strategy for ampligen cfs may include licensing co marketing agreements utilizing the resources and capacities of a strategic partner s 
we are currently seeking worldwide marketing partner s  with the goal of having a relationship in place before approval is obtained 
in parallel to partnering discussions  appropriate pre marketing activities will be undertaken 
we intend to control manufacturing of ampligen on a worldwide basis 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with accredo to develop certain marketing and distribution capacities for ampligen in the united states 
accredo  a division of medco  is one of the nation s largest specialty pharmacy providers 
pursuant to the agreement  accredo assumed certain responsibilities for distribution of ampligen for which they received a fee 
through this arrangement  we may mitigate the necessity of incurring certain up front costs 
accredo has also worked with us in connection with the amp me cfs cost recovery treatment program  amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial and the amp combining ampligen with other antiviral drugs in hiv salvage therapy and amp hiv phase iib clinical trials now under way 
there can be no assurances that this alliance will develop a significant commercial position in any of its targeted chronic disease markets 
the agreement had an initial one year term from february  with successive additional one year terms unless either party notifies the other not less than days prior to the anniversary date of its intent to terminate the agreement 
also  the agreement may be terminated for uncured defaults  or bankruptcy  or insolvency of either party and will automatically terminate upon our receiving an nda for ampligen from the fda  at which time  a new agreement will need to be negotiated with accredo or another major drug distributor 
this agreement offers the potential to provide some marketing and distribution capacity in the united states 
there has been no communication or activity under this agreement for the past few years 
we executed our marketing strategy for alferon n injection by relaunching the product via a collaborative marketing initiative between hemispherx and armada healthcare  a specialty pharmacy network encompassing specialty pharmacists  pharmacies  distributors and targeted physician specialists 
this effort was intended to direct our efforts in the most appropriate and productive market fully exposing our product in the indicated market 
this initiative has had a positive impact on alferon revenues in by focusing on direct  non personal selling efforts to targeted physician audiences 
it is our intent to promote alferon to those dermatologists  ob gyns and family practice ims who are involved in the treatment of patients with refractory or recurring external genital warts and who currently utilize both injectable interferons as well as topical therapeutic agents 
competition rna based products and toll like receptors tlrs have demonstrated great promise in pre clinical and limited clinical applications resulting in active research and development by large pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech firms 
as such  our potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
these companies and their competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products 
in addition  conventional drug therapy  surgery and other more familiar treatments will offer competition to our products 
furthermore  our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining fda  emea health protection branch hpb and other regulatory approvals of products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda  emea and hpb product approvals more rapidly than us 
if any of our products receive regulatory approvals and we commence commercial sales of our products  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have no experience 
our competitors may possess or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that prevent  limit or otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop or exploit our products 
the major pharmaceutical competitors with biotech capabilities vaccine franchises include pfizer  gsk  wyeth  merck  novartis  gilead pharmaceutical  and schering plough corp 
biotech competitors include avant immunotherapeutics  avi biopharma and genta 
alferon n injection currently competes with a product produced by schering for treating genital warts 
m pharmaceutical also markets its immune response modifier product  aldera  for the treatment of genital and perianal warts 
we believe the approval and marketing of this product is the main reason that sales of alferon n injection have not met our expectations since acquisition 
in november  the botanical drug  veregen marketed by bradley pharmaceuticals was also approved for the topical treatment of genital and perianal warts 
government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the us and foreign countries is and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of alferon n products and our ongoing research and product development activities 
ampligen and the products developed from the ongoing research and product development activities will require regulatory clearances prior to commercialization 
in particular  new human drug products for humans are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as a condition for clearance by the fda and by similar authorities in foreign countries 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the ongoing process of compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  has required  and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
we have received orphan drug designation for certain therapeutic indications  which might  under certain conditions  accelerate the process of drug commercialization 
alferon n injection is only approved for use in intra lesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older 
use of alferon n injection for other applications requires regulatory approval 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to such matters as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research work 
the laboratory and production facility in new brunswick  new jersey  which we acquired from isi  is approved for the manufacture of alferon n injection and we believe it is in substantial compliance with all material regulations 
however  we cannot give assurances that facilities owned and operated by third parties that are utilized in the manufacture of our products  are in substantial compliance  or if presently in substantial compliance  will remain so 
research  consulting  licensing and supply agreements as previously discussed above  we acquired a series of patents on oragens  potentially a set of oral broad spectrum antivirals and immunological enhancers  through a licensing agreement with temple university in philadelphia  pa 
we were granted an exclusive worldwide license from temple for the oragens products 
these compounds have been evaluated in various academic laboratories for application to chronic viral and immunological disorders 
pursuant to the terms of our agreement with temple  we are obligated to pay royalties of to of sales depending on the amount of technical assistance required 
we currently pay a royalty of  per year to temple 
this agreement is to remain in effect until the date that the last licensed patent expires unless terminated sooner by mutual consent or default due to royalties not being paid 
the last oragen patent expires on june  we recorded the payment of the royalty as research and development cost for the period incurred 
in december  we entered into an agreement with biovail corporation international biovail 
biovail is an international full service pharmaceutical company engaged in the formulation  clinical testing  registration and manufacture of drug products utilizing advanced drug delivery systems 
biovail is headquartered in toronto  canada 
the agreement grants biovail the exclusive distributorship of our product in the canadian territories subject to certain terms and conditions 
in return  biovail agrees to conduct certain pre marketing clinical studies and market development programs  including without limitation  expansion of the emergency drug release program in canada with respect to our products 
in addition  biovail agrees to work with us in preparing and filing a new drug submission with canadian regulatory authorities at the appropriate time 
biovail invested  in hemispherx equity at prices above the then current market price and agreed to make an additional investment of  based on receiving approval to market ampligen in canada from the appropriate regulatory authorities in canada 
the agreement requires biovail to buy exclusively from us and penetrate certain market segments at specific rates in order to maintain market exclusivity 
the agreement terminates on december   subject to successive two year extensions by the parties and subject to earlier termination by the parties for uncured defaults under the agreement  bankruptcy or insolvency of either party  or withdrawal of our product from canada for a period of more than ninety days for serious adverse health or safety reasons 
in march  our european subsidiary hemispherx sa entered into a sales and distribution agreement with esteve 
in december hemispherx sa assigned all of its rights and obligations under the sales and distribution agreement to us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  esteve was granted the exclusive right to market ampligen in spain  portugal and andorra for the treatment of me cfs 
due to non performance of certain contractually required clinical trials  we notified esteve of our intention to terminate the sales and distribution agreement 
as is its right under the sales and distribution agreement  esteve has applied for arbitration  seeking damages 
we believe esteve s claim is without merit and intend to counterclaim seeking damages 
please see item legal proceedings below 
in october  we signed a research agreement with the national institute of infectious diseases  in tokyo  japan 
the collaboration  by hideki hasegawa  md  md  chief of the laboratory of infectious disease pathology  will assess our experimental therapeutic ampligen as a co administered immunotherapeutic to the institution s nasal flu vaccine 
in october  we also engaged the sage group  inc  a health care  technology oriented  strategy and transaction advisory firm  to assist us in obtaining a strategic alliance in japan for the use of ampligen in treating chronic fatigue syndrome or cfs 
in the past year leaders in the japanese medical community have established the japanese society of the fatigue science and the osaka city university hospital opened the fatigue clinical center as the initial step in their fatigue research project 
in january we expanded our agreement with the sage group  inc to assist us in obtaining a strategic alliance in japan for the use of ampligen in treating avian flu 
in december we concluded an agreement with biken the non profit operational arm of the foundation for microbial diseases of osaka university for the use of our experimental drug  ampligen  as an immune enhancer to influenza vaccines 
our agreement with biken is part of a three party agreement to develop an effective influenza vaccine for japan and utilizes vast resources of the national institute of infectious diseases of japan 
in november  we entered into an agreement with defence r d canada  suffield drdc suffield  an agency of the canadian department of national defence  to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of our experimental therapeutic ampligen and alferon for protection against human respiratory influenza virus infection in well validated animal models 
drdc suffield is conducting research and development of new drugs that could potentially become part of the arsenal of existing antiviral weapons to combat the bird flu 
the initial study will focus on the testing of potential drugs against the respiratory influenza virus infection on a mouse adapted strain of human influenza 
we entered into an agreement with paul griffin and the asclepius trust asclepius whereby we acquired the right  title and interest in certain awarded patents and pending patent applications patents 
consideration given by us for the acquisition of these patents amounted to  paid with shares of our common stock to paul griffin valued at the closing price on the date of the agreement or july  the value of our common stock was on this date and equated to consideration of  shares 
we registered these shares on behalf of mr 
griffin for public resale 
asclepius will receive in consideration a royalty of the gross sums received from all sales utilizing or relying upon the patents 
on july   we executed an agreement with stem cell innovations  inc formerly interferon sciences  inc 
whereby we acquired the royalty interest previously granted interferon sciences with respect to our sale of products containing alpha interferon in exchange for  shares of common stock 
we registered these shares on behalf of stem cell innovations for public resale 
the total consideration paid to stem cell under the agreement amounted to  and was derived by multiplying the number of shares issued by the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the agreement or per share 
we have entered into agreements for consulting services  which are performed at medical research institutions and by medical and clinical research individuals 
our obligation to fund these agreements can be terminated after the initial funding period  which generally ranges from one to three years or on an as needed monthly basis 
during the years ending december   and we incurred approximately   and  respectively  of consulting service fees under these agreements 
these costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
in december  we executed a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington hollister stier  for the contract manufacturing of ampligen for a five year term ending in pursuant to the agreement we will supply the key raw materials and hollister stier formulates and bottles the ampligen 
hollister stier has produced six lots of ampligen through  which are being used in stability studies 
as previously discussed in manufacturing above  on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient quantity and provide any pertinent information to the project 
sales to three large wholesalers cardinal health  amerisourcebergen and mckesson represented approximately and of our total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
human resources as of march   we had personnel consisting of full time employees  regulatory research medical personnel on a part time basis 
part time personnel are paid on a per diem or monthly basis 
personnel are engaged in our research  development  clinical  and manufacturing effort 
of our personnel perform regulatory  general administration  data processing  including bio statistics  financial and investor relations functions 
we have no union employees and we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
while we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and or consultants in the future 
scientific advisory board our scientific advisory board presently consists of two individuals who we believe have particular scientific and medical expertise in virology  cancer  immunology  biochemistry and related fields 
these individuals advise us about current and long term scientific planning including research and development 
this board was originally made up of four medical scientists of which one resigned due to conflict of interest and one resigned for personal reasons 
the scientific advisory board conducts periodic meetings as needed by the clinical studies in progress by us 
no scientific advisory board meetings were held in primarily due to fewer active scientific projects 
however  individual scientific advisory board members sometimes consult with  and meet informally with our employees 
members of the scientific advisory are employed by others and may have commitments to and or consulting agreements with other entities  including our potential competitors 
item a 
risk factors 
the following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements made in this form k 
among the key factors that have a direct bearing on our results of operations are risks associated with our business no assurance of successful product development ampligen and related products 
the development of ampligen and our other related products is subject to a number of significant risks 
ampligen may be found to be ineffective or to have adverse side effects  fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  be difficult to manufacture on a commercial scale  be uneconomical to market or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary right of third parties 
our products are in various stages of clinical and pre clinical development and  require further clinical studies and appropriate regulatory approval processes before any such products can be marketed 
we do not know when  if ever  ampligen or our other products will be generally available for commercial sale for any indication 
generally  only a small percentage of potential therapeutic products are eventually approved by the fda for commercial sale 
on december  a refusal to file rtf letter was received because the application was deemed not substantially complete 
a written response was developed and submitted to the fda addressing pre clinical and clinical questions 
ampligen represents the first drug in class of rna nucleic acid molecules to apply for nda review 
we can provide no guidance as to the tentative date at which the filing of the nda will be accepted or  if accepted  when or if the nda will be approved 
the timing of the fda review process of the nda is subject to the control of the fda and could result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen for use in treating me cfs patients require more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our nda application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen 
alferon n injection 
although alferon n injection is approved for marketing in the united states for the intra lesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older  to date it has not been approved for other indications 
we face many of the risks discussed above  with regard to developing this product for use to treat other ailments 
our drug and related technologies are investigational and subject to regulatory approval 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  our operations will be significantly affected 
all of our drugs and associated technologies  other than alferon n injection  are investigational and must receive prior regulatory approval by appropriate regulatory authorities for general use and are currently legally available only through clinical trials with specified disorders 
at present  alferon n injection is only approved for the intra lesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older 
use of alferon n injection for other indications will require regulatory approval 
our products  including ampligen  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries  including  but not limited to  the fda in the us  the health protection branch hpb of canada  and the agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea in europe 
obtaining regulatory approvals is a rigorous and lengthy process and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in order to obtain final regulatory approval of a new drug  we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory agency that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product to the applicable regulatory standards 
we require regulatory approval in order to market ampligen or any other proposed product and receive product revenues or royalties 
we cannot assure you that ampligen will ultimately be demonstrated to be safe or efficacious 
in addition  while ampligen is authorized for use in clinical trials including a cost recovery program in the united states and europe  we cannot assure you that additional clinical trial approvals will be authorized in the united states or in other countries  in a timely fashion or at all  or that we will complete these clinical trials 
if ampligen or one of our other products does not receive regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere  our operations most likely will be materially adversely affected 
although preliminary in vitro testing indicates that ampligen enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian influenza  preliminary testing in the laboratory is not necessarily predictive of successful results in clinical testing or human treatment 
ampligen is undergoing pre clinical testing for possible treatment of avian flu 
although preliminary in vitro testing indicates that ampligen enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian flu  preliminary testing in the laboratory is not necessarily predictive of successful results in clinical testing or human treatment 
no assurance can be given that similar results will be observed in clinical trials 
use of ampligen in the treatment of avian flu requires prior regulatory approval 
only the fda can determine whether a drug is safe  effective or promising for treating a specific application 
as discussed in the prior risk factor  obtaining regulatory approvals is a rigorous and lengthy process 
in addition  ampligen is being tested on two strains of avian influenza virus 
there are a number of strains and strains mutate 
no assurance can be given that ampligen will be effective on any strains that might infect humans 
we may continue to incur substantial losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
we began operations in and last reported net profit from through since  we have incurred substantial operating losses  as we pursued our clinical trial effort to get our experimental drug  ampligen  approved 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately  we have not yet generated significant revenues from our products and may incur substantial and increased losses in the future 
we cannot assure that we will ever achieve significant revenues from product sales or become profitable 
we require  and will continue to require  the commitment of substantial resources to develop our products 
we cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successfully completed or that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that any products will be manufactured and marketed successfully  or be profitable 
we may require additional financing which may not be available 
the development of our products will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time consuming research  preclinical development  and clinical trials that are necessary to bring pharmaceutical products to market 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we anticipate  but cannot assure  that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the next months 
on april   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with fusion capital pursuant to which fusion capital has agreed  under certain conditions and with certain limitations  to purchase on each trading day  of our common stock up to an aggregate of  over a month period see part i  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
we only have the right to receive up to  per trading day under the agreement with fusion capital unless our stock price exceeds by at least  in which case the daily amount may be increased under certain conditions as the price of our common stock increases 
fusion capital shall not have the right nor the obligation to purchase any shares of our common stock on any trading days that the market price of our common stock is less than 
we have registered an aggregate of  shares purchasable by fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement inclusive of up to  additional commitment shares and  through march   we have sold to fusion capital an aggregate of  shares under the common stock purchase agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately  assuming a purchase price of per share the closing sale price of the common stock on march  and the purchase by fusion capital of the remaining  shares not including the remaining  commitment shares  total gross proceeds to us from the remaining shares would only be   in the aggregate under the common stock purchase agreement 
in the event we elect to issue additional shares to fusion capital  we will be required to file a new registration statement and have it declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  fusion capital cannot purchase more than  shares  inclusive of commitment shares under the common stock purchase agreement 
accordingly  depending upon the future market price of our common stock  even if we register the balance of the shares issuable to fusion capital under the purchase agreement  we most likely will realize much less than the maximum  proceeds from the sale of stock under the purchase agreement 
in this regard  our current stock price is under and  accordingly  unless and until the market price increases to at least  no additional shares will be sold to fusion capital under the agreement 
the extent to which we rely on fusion capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including  the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
if obtaining sufficient financing from fusion capital were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive and if we are unable to commercialize and sell ampligen and or increase sales of alferon n injection or our other products  we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs 
even if we are able to access the full  under the common stock purchase agreement with fusion capital  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
we may not be profitable unless we can protect our patents and or receive approval for additional pending patents 
we need to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering the use of ampligen for a particular disease in order to obtain exclusive rights for the commercial sale of ampligen for such disease 
we obtained all rights to alferon n injection  and we plan to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering its use for existing and potentially new diseases 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to preserve and obtain patent protection for our products and to obtain and preserve our trade secrets and expertise 
certain of our know how and technology is not patentable  particularly the procedures for the manufacture of our experimental drug  ampligen  which is carried out according to standard operating procedure manuals 
we have been issued certain patents including those on the use of ampligen and ampligen in combination with certain other drugs for the treatment of hiv 
we also have been issued patents on the use of ampligen in combination with certain other drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus  chronic hepatitis c virus  and a patent which affords protection on the use of ampligen in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
we have not yet been issued any patents in the united states for the use of ampligen as a sole treatment for any of the cancers  which we have sought to target 
with regard to alferon n injection  we have acquired from isi its patents for natural alpha interferon produced from human peripheral blood leukocytes and its production process and we have filed a patent application for the use of alferon ldo in treating viral diseases including avian influenza 
we cannot assure that our competitors will not seek and obtain patents regarding the use of similar products in combination with various other agents  for a particular target indication prior to our doing such 
if we cannot protect our patents covering the use of our products for a particular disease  or obtain additional patents  we may not be able to successfully market our products 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of protection afforded by pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents 
there can be no assurance that new patent applications relating to our products or technology will result in patents being issued or that  if issued  such patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology 
it is generally anticipated that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
such litigation could require substantial resources from us and we may not have the financial resources necessary to enforce the patent rights that we hold 
no assurance can be made that our patents will provide competitive advantages for our products or will not be successfully challenged by competitors 
no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to develop or market our products or to obtain or maintain any competitive position that we may achieve with respect to our products 
our patents also may not prevent others from developing competitive products using related technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary licenses if we cannot enforce patent rights we may hold 
in addition  the failure of third parties from whom we currently license certain proprietary information or from whom we may be required to obtain such licenses in the future  to adequately enforce their rights to such proprietary information  could adversely affect the value of such licenses to us 
if we cannot enforce the patent rights we currently hold we may be required to obtain licenses from others to develop  manufacture or market our products 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we currently license certain proprietary information from third parties  some of which may have been developed with government grants under circumstances where the government maintained certain rights with respect to the proprietary information developed 
no assurances can be given that such third parties will adequately enforce any rights they may have or that the rights  if any  retained by the government will not adversely affect the value of our license 
there is no guarantee that our trade secrets will not be disclosed or known by our competitors 
to protect our rights  we require certain employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements with us 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate and enforceable remedies for any breach  or that any trade secrets of ours will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we have limited marketing and sales capability 
if we are unable to obtain additional distributors and our current and future distributors do not market our products successfully  we may not generate significant revenues or become profitable 
we have limited marketing and sales capability 
we are dependent upon existing and  possibly future  marketing agreements and third party distribution agreements for our products in order to generate significant revenues and become profitable 
as a result  any revenues received by us will be dependent in large part on the efforts of third parties  and there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
our commercialization strategy for ampligen cfs may include licensing co marketing agreements utilizing the resources and capacities of a strategic partner s 
we are currently seeking worldwide marketing partner s  with the goal of having a relationship in place before approval is obtained 
in parallel to partnering discussions  appropriate pre marketing activities will be undertaken 
we intend to control manufacturing of ampligen on a worldwide basis 
we cannot assure that our us or foreign marketing strategy will be successful or that we will be able to establish future marketing or third party distribution agreements on terms acceptable to us  or that the cost of establishing these arrangements will not exceed any product revenues 
there are no long term agreements with suppliers of required materials 
if we are unable to obtain the required raw materials  we may be required to scale back our operations or stop manufacturing alferon n injection and or ampligen 
a number of essential materials are used in the production of alferon n injection  including human white blood cells 
we do not have long term agreements for the supply of any of such materials 
there can be no assurance we can enter into long term supply agreements covering essential materials on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
there are a limited number of manufacturers in the united states available to provide the polymers for use in manufacturing ampligen 
at present  we do not have any agreements with third parties for the supply of any of these polymers 
we have established relevant manufacturing operations within our new brunswick  new jersey facility for the production of ampligen polymers from raw materials in order to obtain polymers on a more consistent manufacturing basis 
if we are unable to obtain or manufacture the required polymers  we may be required to scale back our operations or stop manufacturing 
the costs and availability of products and materials we need for the production of ampligen and the commercial production of alferon n injection and other products which we may commercially produce are subject to fluctuation depending on a variety of factors beyond our control  including competitive factors  changes in technology  and fda and other governmental regulations and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such products and materials on terms acceptable to us or at all 
there is no assurance that successful manufacture of a drug on a limited scale basis for investigational use will lead to a successful transition to commercial  large scale production 
small changes in methods of manufacturing  including commercial scale up  may affect the chemical structure of ampligen and other rna drugs  as well as their safety and efficacy  and can  among other things  require new clinical studies and affect orphan drug status  particularly  market exclusivity rights  if any  under the orphan drug act 
the transition from limited production of pre clinical and clinical research quantities to production of commercial quantities of our products will involve distinct management and technical challenges and will require additional management and technical personnel and capital to the extent such manufacturing is not handled by third parties 
there can be no assurance that our manufacturing will be successful or that any given product will be determined to be safe and effective  capable of being manufactured economically in commercial quantities or successfully marketed 
we have limited manufacturing experience and capacity 
ampligen has been only produced in limited quantities for use in our clinical trials and we are dependent upon a third party supplier for substantially all of the production process 
the failure to continue these arrangements or to achieve other such arrangements on satisfactory terms could have a material adverse affect on us 
also  to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs 
to the extent we are involved in the production process  our current facilities are not adequate for the production of our proposed products for large scale commercialization  and we currently do not have adequate personnel to conduct commercial scale manufacturing 
we intend to utilize third party facilities if and when the need arises or  if we are unable to do so  to build or acquire commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
we will need to comply with regulatory requirements for such facilities  including those of the fda pertaining to current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations 
there can be no assurance that such facilities can be used  built  or acquired on commercially acceptable terms  or that such facilities  if used  built  or acquired  will be adequate for our long term needs 
we may not be profitable unless we can produce ampligen or other products in commercial quantities at costs acceptable to us 
we have never produced ampligen or any other products in large commercial quantities 
we must manufacture our products in compliance with regulatory requirements in large commercial quantities and at acceptable costs in order for us to be profitable 
we intend to utilize third party manufacturers and or facilities if and when the need arises or  if we are unable to do so  to build or acquire commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
if we cannot manufacture commercial quantities of ampligen or enter into third party agreements for its manufacture at costs acceptable to us  our operations will be significantly affected 
also  each production lot of alferon n injection is subject to fda review and approval prior to releasing the lots to be sold 
this review and approval process could take considerable time  which would delay our having product in inventory to sell 
rapid technological change may render our products obsolete or non competitive 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
technological competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
most of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than us  as well as substantial marketing  financial and managerial resources  and represent significant competition for us 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments 
our products may be subject to substantial competition 
ampligen 
competitors may be developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these potential products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects to products being developed by us 
these competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products 
in addition  conventional drug therapy  surgery and other more familiar treatments may offer competition to our products 
furthermore  many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than us in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining fda  hpb and other regulatory approvals of products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda  hpb or other regulatory product approvals more rapidly than us 
there are no drugs approved for commercial sale with respect to treating me cfs in the united states 
the dominant competitors with drugs to treat disease indications in which we plan to address include gilead pharmaceutical  pfizer  bristol myers  abbott labs  glaxo smith kline  merck and schering plough corp 
these potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
although we believe our principal advantage is the unique mechanism of action of ampligen on the immune system  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete 
alferon n injection 
our competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
alferon n injection currently competes with schering s injectable recombinant alpha interferon product intron a for the treatment of genital warts 
m pharmaceuticals also offer competition from its immune response modifier  aldara  a self administered topical cream  for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts 
in addition  medigene recently received fda approval for a self administered ointment  veregentm  which is indicated for the topical treatment of external genital and perianal warts 
alferon n injection also competes with surgical  chemical  and other methods of treating genital warts 
we cannot assess the impact products developed by our competitors  or advances in other methods of the treatment of genital warts  will have on the commercial viability of alferon n injection 
if and when we obtain additional approvals of uses of this product  we expect to compete primarily on the basis of product performance 
our competitors have developed or may develop products containing either alpha or beta interferon or other therapeutic compounds or other treatment modalities for those uses 
there can be no assurance that  if we are able to obtain regulatory approval of alferon n injection for the treatment of new indications  we will be able to achieve any significant penetration into those markets 
in addition  because certain competitive products are not dependent on a source of human blood cells  such products may be able to be produced in greater volume and at a lower cost than alferon n injection 
currently  our wholesale price on a per unit basis of alferon n injection is higher than that of the competitive recombinant alpha and beta interferon products 
general 
other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do  obtaining approvals for such products from the fda more rapidly than we do  or developing products that are more effective than those we may develop 
while we will attempt to expand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive  there can be no assurance that research and development by others or other medical advances will not render our technology or products obsolete or non competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop 
possible side effects from the use of ampligen or alferon n injection could adversely affect potential revenues and physician patient acceptability of our product 
ampligen 
we believe that ampligen has been generally well tolerated with a low incidence of clinical toxicity  particularly given the severely debilitating or life threatening diseases that have been treated 
a mild flushing reaction has been observed in approximately of patients treated in our various studies 
this reaction is occasionally accompanied by a rapid heart beat  a tightness of the chest  urticaria swelling of the skin  anxiety  shortness of breath  subjective reports of feeling hot  sweating and nausea 
the reaction is usually infusion rate related and can generally be controlled by reducing the rate of infusion 
other adverse side effects include liver enzyme level elevations  diarrhea  itching  asthma  low blood pressure  photophobia  rash  transient visual disturbances  slow or irregular heart rate  decreases in platelets and white blood cell counts  anemia  dizziness  confusion  elevation of kidney function tests  occasional temporary hair loss and various flu like symptoms  including fever  chills  fatigue  muscular aches  joint pains  headaches  nausea and vomiting 
these flu like side effects typically subside within several months 
one or more of the potential side effects might deter usage of ampligen in certain clinical situations and therefore  could adversely affect potential revenues and physician patient acceptability of our product 
alferon n injection 
at present  alferon n injection is only approved for the intra lesional within the lesion treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in adults 
in clinical trials conducted for the treatment of genital warts with alferon n injection  patients did not experience serious side effects  however  there can be no assurance that unexpected or unacceptable side effects will not be found in the future for this use or other potential uses of alferon n injection which could threaten or limit such product s usefulness 
we may be subject to product liability claims from the use of ampligen  alferon n injection  or other of our products which could negatively affect our future operations 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of ampligen or other of our products results in adverse effects 
this liability might result from claims made directly by patients  hospitals  clinics or other consumers  or by pharmaceutical companies or others manufacturing these products on our behalf 
our future operations may be negatively affected from the litigation costs  settlement expenses and lost product sales inherent to these claims 
while we will continue to attempt to take appropriate precautions  we cannot assure that we will avoid significant product liability exposure 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide adequate coverage against ampligen and or alferon n injection product liability claims 
a successful product liability claim against us in excess of ampligen s  in insurance coverage   in aggregate  or in excess of alferon n injection s  in insurance coverage   in aggregate  or for which coverage is not provided could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition 
the loss of services of key personnel including dr 
william a 
carter could hurt our chances for success 
our success is dependent on the continued efforts of dr 
william a 
carter because of his position as a pioneer in the field of nucleic acid drugs  his being the co inventor of ampligen  and his knowledge of our overall activities  including patents and clinical trials 
the loss of dr 
carter s services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and chances for success 
we have secured key man life insurance in the amount of  on the life of dr 
carter and we have an employment agreement with dr 
carter that  as amended  runs until december  however  dr 
carter has the right to terminate his employment upon not less than days prior written notice 
the loss of dr 
carter or other personnel or the failure to recruit additional personnel as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives 
uncertainty of health care reimbursement for our products 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and from time to time legislation is proposed  which  if adopted  could further restrict the prices charged by and or amounts reimbursable to manufacturers of pharmaceutical products 
we cannot predict what  if any  legislation will ultimately be adopted or the impact of such legislation on us 
there can be no assurance that third party insurance companies will allow us to charge and receive payments for products sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
there are risks of liabilities associated with handling and disposing of hazardous materials 
our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  carcinogenic chemicals  flammable solvents and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident or the failure to comply with applicable regulations  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could be significant 
we do not maintain insurance coverage against such liabilities 
risks associated with an investment in our common stock the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile 
in addition to general economic  political and market conditions  the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors  adverse reactions to products  governmental approvals  delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products  changes in us or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates  conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries  new accounting standards  and the occurrence of any of the risks described in these risk factors 
our common stock is listed for quotation on the american stock exchange 
for the month period ended december   the price of our common stock has ranged from to per share 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile 
the average daily trading volume of our common stock varies significantly 
our relatively low average volume and low average number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices and a more active market may never develop 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry 
if we face securities litigation in the future  even if without merit or unsuccessful  it would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would negatively impact our business 
our stock price may be adversely affected if a significant amount of shares are sold in the public market 
we have registered  for sale by fusion capital and  shares by others  and have stockholder authorization to register an additional  shares for sale by fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement that expires april  as of december   approximately  shares of our common stock  constituted restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act 
also  we have registered  shares issuable upon exercise of of certain warrants and upon exercise of certain other warrants 
registration of the shares permits the sale of the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions without compliance with the requirements of rule to the extent the exercise price of the warrants is less than the market price of the common stock  the holders of the warrants are likely to exercise them and sell the underlying shares of common stock and to the extent that the conversion price and exercise price of these securities are adjusted pursuant to anti dilution protection  the securities could be exercisable or convertible for even more shares of common stock 
we also may issue shares to be used to meet our capital requirements or use shares to compensate employees  consultants and or directors 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease 
furthermore  a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
the sale of our common stock to fusion capital may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by fusion capital and other shares registered for selling stockholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the sale by fusion capital and other selling stockholders of our common stock will increase the number of our publicly traded shares  which could depress the market price of our common stock 
moreover  the mere prospect of sales by fusion capital and other selling stockholders could depress the market price for our common stock 
the issuance of shares to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement will dilute the equity interest of existing stockholders and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
the purchase price for the common stock to be sold to fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock 
all shares sold to fusion capital are to be freely tradable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares of common stock purchased from us at any time 
we expect that the shares offered by fusion capital will be sold over a period of in excess of two years 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of shares by fusion at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to fusion capital pursuant to the purchase agreement  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could defer a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  prior to the redemption of our common stock 
in this regard  in november  we adopted a stockholder rights plan and  under the plan  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  each right initially entitles holders to buy one unit of preferred stock for 
the rights generally are not transferable apart from the common stock and will not be exercisable unless and until a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock 
however  for dr 
carter  our chief executive officer  who already beneficially owns of our common stock  the plan s threshold will be  instead of 
the rights will expire on november   and may be redeemed prior thereto at 
per right under certain circumstances

background we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the manufacture and clinical development of new drug entities for treatment of seriously debilitating disorders 
our flagship products include alferon n injection and the experimental therapeutics ampligen and oragens 
alferon n injection is approved for a category of std infection  and ampligen and oragens represent experimental rna nucleic acids being developed for globally important viral diseases and disorders of the immune system 
hemispherx s platform technology includes large and small agent components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases 
we have in excess of patents comprising our core intellectual property estate  a fully commercialized product alferon n injection and gmp certified manufacturing facilities for our novel pharma products 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting research and development programs 
results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was lower when compared to the same period in this  reduction in loss was primarily due to higher interest and other income of approximately  mainly due to higher interest earned upon the maturity of our marketable securities as compared to the same period a year ago  lower interest expense and financing costs of  in relating to the amortization of debt discounts on our convertible debentures and the incurring of liquidated damages in payable to our debenture holders resulting from us failing to timely file our annual report on form k  and an increase of  in other income due to a reversal of accrued liquidated damages in with respect to our debentures holders as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k 
these damages related to certain debenture covenants settled without charge in the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balances in net loss per share was for the current period versus for the same period in revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program was down  or and alferon n injection sales were up  or as compared to the prior period 
ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
this program has been in effect for several years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
we altered our marketing strategy for alferon n injection by relaunching the product via a collaborative marketing initiative between hemispherx and a national specialty pharmacy network encompassing specialty pharmacists  pharmacies and targeted physician specialists 
this effort was intended to focus our efforts in the most appropriate and productive market segment for the product 
while alferon n dollar sales are up from  unit sales are down which reflects the effect of the price increase put into place in february production costs cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  during the current period representing a decrease of approximately  or as compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to lower production costs of  relating to excess production capacity during the prior period as more effort was directed toward ampligen research and development and the nda  and a decrease in costs of goods sold of  costs of goods sold for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in unit sales in the current year versus the prior year 
we outsourced certain components of our overall research and development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution while maintaining control over the entire process through our quality assurance group and our clinical monitoring group 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period a year ago representing an increase of  or 
these costs are primarily related to the collection and processing of clinical data  including the costs of establishing our in house polymer production facility and the costs of preparing and completing our nda for the use of ampligen in treating cfs 
the year to year increase can be basically attributed to an increase in the use of consultants related to the preparation of our ampligen nda 
our primary focus in was on the preparation of the nda for using ampligen to treat patients affected with cfs 
in addition  we documented our polymer production process in anticipation of an fda inspection 
three lots of liquid ampligen were produced for use in testing and stability studies 
we finalized the filing of our ampligen nda on october  on december  a refusal to file rtf letter was received because the application was deemed not substantially complete 
a written response was developed and submitted to the fda on january  addressing fourteen pre clinical and clinical questions 
at our scheduled guidance meeting with the fda on february   the number of items necessary to accomplish a complete filing for review purposes was reduced from the original fourteen to five 
nine of the original fourteen incomplete items are no longer considered as filing related issues 
the five remaining open items are being addressed by our clinical staff with the expectation of filing five additional amendments to the original nda that was filed on october  much of our r d cost is related to production of raw materials at our new production line installed at our new brunswick facility 
this facility produces poly i and poly c 
u for use by hollister stier our contract manufacturer in the manufacture of ampligen 
the first pilot production runs are being used for stability testing 
later commercial sized runs are being used for process validation and clinical use 
in addition  we are engaged in broad based  ongoing  experimental studies assessing the efficacy of ampligen  alferon n injection  and alferon ldo against influenza viruses as an adjuvant single agent antiviral with defence r d canada  japan s national institute of infectious disease  biken the non profit operational arm of the foundation for microbial diseases of osaka university and st 
vincent s hospital in darlinghurst  australia 
the biken arrangement was concluded in december and basically consists of biken purchasing ampligen from us for use in conducting further animal studies of intranasal prototype vaccines containing antigens from influenza sub types hn  hn and b progressing to human studies with all programs supported by the japanese health ministry 
under the terms of the non exclusive licensing arrangement  we will receive royalties as well as income for all ampligen used in the ongoing experimental work and any subsequent marketing of ampligen as an immuno enhancer for flu vaccines delivered intranasally in japan 
to date  only or pharma companies worldwide have achieved regulatory authorizations to sell intranasally in administered influenza vaccines versus many companies receiving approval for intramuscular vaccine delivery routes 
safety has been paramount in developing effective treatments 
however  animal studies to date indicate ampligen  an experimental drug  may be safely administered intranasally 
clinical studies in other disorders have built a database of more than  injections of ampligen when given parenterally intravenous  or iv 
in september  japan s national institute of infectious disease jniid initiated research on the co administration of jniid s hiv vaccine with our experimental tlr agonist a substance that binds to a specific receptor and triggers a host defense response in the cell and immune enhancer  ampligen 
this research is the result of earlier research suggesting a potential role for ampligen in boosting responses to certain vaccines designed to combat avian influenza bird flu as well as seasonal influenza viruses 
the objective of this research is to determine if ampligen can overcome the historical problem which has handicapped aids vaccine development  namely marginal immune response which undermines the potential of long lasting protection 
ampligen will be combined with hiv recombinant protein and administered via an intranasal route 
in october  jniid published  in two peer reviewed journals  the results of their studies to evaluate the ability of current seasonal influenza vaccine to confer cross protection against highly pathogenic hn influenza bird flu virus in mice 
these studies indicate that  as a vaccine enhancer co administered with their seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine  ampligen helps induce a protective effect against hn influenza viruses 
as such  ampligen as a toll like receptor agonist may aid in overcoming the problems protecting against mutated strains of the hn virus and of limited supplies of hn virus vaccines 
additional studies to support this conclusion are planned 
in june  we initiated a clinical trial in australia using ampligen in combination with seasonal flu vaccine 
this trial  expected to continue for several months  is being conducted in australia s winter season and focuses on populations at risk for virulent cases of influenza  especially those over the age of years who historically may have weakened immune systems 
the australian clinical trial was prompted by the results from the pre clinical work conducted by the jniid see above 
thirty patients are anticipated to be enrolled in this study  which will utilize a two dose ampligen regimen of mg per dose 
this study is being monitored by clinical network services pty 
ltd 
located in brisbane  australia 
the clinical trials center of st 
vincent s hospital based in darlinghurst  australia is conducting the trial 
prospective patients are being screened to be included in the clinical trial 
the center for disease control and prevention reports that the number of mosquito borne west nile virus wnv infections in the united states is up sharply over the same period in this increased infection rate has accelerated the enrollment of patients in our phase iib clinical trial using alferon n to treat wnv patients 
in lab studies  alferon n  a natural cocktail of eight alpha interferons  shows synergistic effects up to fold over recombinant interferons against pathogens such as wnv 
the phase iib clinical trial is a double blinded  randomized  multi center program under the direction of cornell university and weill cornell medical college new york hospital 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of  or 
this increase related primarily to an increase in legal and professional fees of  primarily due to on going litigation involving bioclones  increase in travel related expenses of  and increases in salaries and wages of  mainly resulting from the hire of our chief operating officer during the th quarter these increases in general and administrative costs were offset by lower accounting fees of  in the decrease in accounting fees was primarily due to charges incurred by us in related to the restatements to our financial statements in lastly  we incurred impairment losses in amounting to  as compared to no such charges in the prior year 
the primary reason for these charges stemmed from the  write down of a water purification system that was determined to be unnecessary at our new jersey facility due to a change in manufacturing plans 
in addition  we wrote down the value of our intangible asset associated with the repurchase of a royalty on alferon n injection sales by  we determined that we did not have sufficient inventory on hand to realize the full economic benefit of this asset  therefore  it was written down to its net realizable value 
our operating funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the next months as we have taken steps to curtail discretionary spending to conserve cash and reduce our monthly burn rate 
reversal of previously accrued interest expense reversal of previously accrued interest expense was  for the year ended december  this item  classified as other income  resulted from the reversal of accrued liquidated damages in related to a certain covenant in our debenture agreements 
these charges were incurred as a result of our failure to timely file our annual report on form k and our report on form q for the quarterly period ended march  with the sec pursuant to the act 
these liquidated damages were not included as part of the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balances 
interest and other income interest and other income for the year ended december  and increased approximately  as compared to the same period a year earlier 
the increase in interest and other income during the current period was mainly due to higher interest earned upon the maturity of our marketable securities as compared to the same period a year ago 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and non cash financing costs were approximately  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
the main reason for the decrease in interest expense and financing costs of  or can be attributed to decreased amortization charges on debt discounts and the incurring of liquidated damages in payable to our debenture holders resulting from our failure to timely file our annual report on form k as we were in violation of provisions within our debenture agreements 
these debentures matured in june and all outstanding loan balances were paid off 
years ended december  vs 
net loss our net loss of  for the year ended december  was up  or compared to the same period in this increase in loss was primarily due to higher general and administrative g a expense of  related primarily to the adoption of fas r amounting to higher stock compensation expense of  and higher accounting fees of  mainly related to the restatement of our financial statements  higher research and development costs of  due to an increase in direct costs associated with developing ampligen and alferon n injection for new and existing indications and costs associated with stability studies for ampligen and alferon n injection related to manufacturing at our new contract manufacturer s sites  hollister stier and hyaluron  and higher production costs of approximately  primarily due to excess manufacturing capacity 
offsetting these increased expenditures  was a net decrease in our interest expense and financing costs of approximately  as the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debentures has been decreasing as they near maturity 
net losses per share were 
for current period versus 
for the same period revenues revenues for the years ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program was up  or and alferon n injection sales were down  or 
the decline in alferon n injection sales can be attributed to increased competition from rival products 
ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
this program has been in effect for several years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
we are altering our marketing strategy for alferon n injection 
we plan to establish an internal marketing and sales department to facilitate and refine our commercialization initiatives 
production costs cost of goods sold our costs for production cost of goods sold increased  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to higher production costs representing excess production capacity during the current period amounting to  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
during  hyaluron conducted three production runs for stability testing of alferon n injection s new vial material 
the stability test results at the six month check point met the required specifications 
the stability and validation testing of the new vials was successfully completed by year end we purchased the royalty interest related to the sales of our natural alpha interferon products from stem cell innovations  inc previously known as interferon sciences  inc for  in march  we acquired the fda approved manufacturing facility in new brunswick  nj and the worldwide license for the production  manufacture  use  marketing and sale of alferon n injection 
the royalty interest on the interferon products was a residual of this transaction 
we outsource certain components of our overall research and development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution while maintaining control over the entire process through our quality assurance group and our clinical monitoring group 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period a year ago representing an increase of  or 
the higher costs reflect an increase in the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen  as a therapy in treating acute and chronic diseases  cancers and on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv and pre clinical and clinical testing for possible treatment for avian and seasonal influenza viruses 
also  incremental costs were incurred for development of alternative delivery routes for alferon n more suitable for various biodefense treatment indications 
much of this increase in r d cost is related to the production of raw materials at our new production line recently installed at our new brunswick facility 
the new brunswick facility successfully produced three lots of poly i and three lots of poly c 
u  which have been shipped to hollister stier our contract manufacturer for use in producing ampligen doses 
for current status on research development activities see part i  item business and management s discussion and analysis for the period december  vs 
december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the years ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of a  or 
the increase in g a expenses relates primarily to the adoption of fas r which has increased stock compensation expense approximately  during versus a year ago 
in addition  we have incurred higher accounting fees related to the restatement of our financial statements which has increased these fees by approximately  from the same period a year earlier 
interest and other income and expense interest and other income for the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income during can primarily be attributed to the timing of the maturities of our marketable securities during the period versus the same period a year earlier 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and non cash financing costs were approximately  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
the main reason for the decrease in interest expense and financing costs of  can be attributed to decreased amortization charges on debt discounts during versus the same period a year earlier as our convertible debentures have come closer to maturity please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  reflecting mainly expenditures for the preparation and filing of the ampligen nda 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ending december   amounted to  primarily from the maturity of short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  amounted to  basically from the sale of common stock for proceeds totaling  partially offset by our net payment to our debenture holders of  upon the maturity of our debt instruments 
as of february  we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  or a decrease of approximately from december  these funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the next months as we have taken steps to curtail discretionary spending to conserve cash and reduce our monthly burn rate 
in june  we retired all remaining debt related to our convertible debentures issued in october  january and july of the outstanding debt of approximately  only  was required to be paid in new funds to retire the debentures  with the balance being covered by other cash and securities already held as collateral for the debentures 
over the long term  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products

the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement

our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenue from the sale of ampligen under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred

the investments classified as available for sale include debt securities and equity securities carried at estimated fair value 
the unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
inventories we use the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting for inventory 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years

stock based compensation under fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of fas r  effective january   using a modified prospective application 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
because we previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of fas  we recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under fas  except that forfeiture rates are estimated for all options  as required by fas r 
the cumulative effect of applying the forfeiture rates is not material 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
concentration of credit risk our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks

concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process 
we do not require collateral on our receivables
