over the last two years we have experienced membership and revenue growth in our medicaid managed care segment including membership growth of 
the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to our growth in  we acquired phytrust of south carolina  llc  or phytrust  as well as physician s choice  llc  both of which manage care on a non risk basis for medicaid members in south carolina 
at december   our non risk membership in south carolina was  members 
we also became licensed in to provide risk based managed care in the state and began participating in the transition of the state s conversion to at risk managed care in december  with members at december  in february  we began managing care for ssi recipients in the san antonio and corpus christi markets of texas with  members at december  in  we began managing care for ssi members in four regions of ohio  with  members at december  in july  we entered seven new counties in the east central market of ohio  and in october  we entered new counties in the northwest market of ohio with  members at december  in september  we expanded operations in texas to include medicaid and schip members in the corpus christi  austin and lubbock markets  with  members at december  in georgia  we began managing care for medicaid and schip members in the atlanta and central regions effective june  and southwest region effective september  at december   our membership in georgia was  we have opportunities to expand our operations through the following acquisitions and new contract awards in july  we acquired a minority ownership interest in access health solutions  llc  or access  which provides managed care for medicaid recipients in florida  with  members at december  we have been awarded a contract in texas for the children in foster care program 
this statewide program will provide managed care services to participants in the texas foster care program 
the state of texas has indicated that membership operations are expected to commence april 
table of contents the following new contracts and acquisitions contributed to the growth in our specialty services segment during the last two years effective october   we began to provide long term care services in the maricopa  yuma and lapaz counties in arizona 
effective july   we acquired the managed vision business of opticare managed vision  inc  or opticare 
effective may   we acquired cardium health services corporation  or cardium  a health management company

results of continuing operations and key metrics summarized comparative financial data for  and are as follows in millions change change premium premium tax service total revenues medical costs cost of services general and administrative expenses premium tax expense earnings from operations investment and other income  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit expense of  and respectively net earnings loss diluted earnings loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations total diluted earnings loss per common share revenues and revenue recognition our medicaid managed care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments  collectively  premium taxes  and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenue as well as operating expenses 
some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data 
these adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 
our specialty services segment generates revenues under contracts with state programs  healthcare organizations  and other commercial organizations  as well as from our own subsidiaries on market based terms 
revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue 
for performance based contracts  we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 
premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents our total revenue increased in the year ended december  over the previous year primarily through membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment  premium rate increases  and growth in our specialty services segment 
membership growth from december  to december   we increased our medicaid managed care membership by 
the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment december  georgia indiana new jersey ohio south carolina texas wisconsin total the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment december  medicaid schip ssi total from december  to december   our membership increased primarily as a result of increases in ohio  south carolina and texas 
we increased our medicaid membership in ohio by adding members under our new contract in the northwest region 
we also increased our ssi membership in ohio with the commencement of our new contract to serve aged  blind or disabled members 
our membership in south carolina is primarily on a non risk basis  we began conversion to at risk in december  with at risk members at december  in texas  we increased our membership through new medicaid  schip and ssi contracts in the corpus christi  san antonio  austin  and lubbock markets 
our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs  eligibility administration issues and the termination of certain physician contracts associated with a high cost hospital system 
our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to adjustments made to our provider network made in connection with our new state wide contract as well as the termination of certain non exclusive physician contracts 
in florida  access served  members on a non risk basis at december  during  our subsidiary  peach state health plan  commenced operations in the atlanta and central regions of georgia in june and in the southwest region in september 
we increased our membership in ohio through the mediplan acquisition while also adding members under our new contract in the east central and northwest markets 
in texas  we increased our membership through new contracts in the corpus christi  austin  and lubbock markets 
our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs and eligibility administration issues 
our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to provider terminations 
the total revenue associated with firstguard included in results from discontinued operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our firstguard membership was  and  at december  and  respectively 
premium rate increases in  we received premium rate increases ranging from to  or on a composite basis across our markets 
in  we received premium rate increases ranging from to  or on a composite basis across our markets 
in november  we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia of approximately effective july  the state also mandated service changes  retroactively recalculated certain rate cells and adjusted for duplicate member issues 
we executed this amendment on november  the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january and  accordingly  we will record the additional revenue  retroactive to july   in the first quarter of this revenue  related to the period from july  to december   totals approximately million 
approximately million of this amount is related to the mandated services  rate cell changes and duplicate member issues  the remaining million yields the calculated increase 

table of contents specialty services segment growth for the year ended december   specialty services segment revenue from external customers was million compared to million for the same prior year period 
the increase is primarily attributable to a full year of operations in of our acquisition of opticare in july and the commencement of operations of bridgeway health solutions in october at december   our behavioral health company  cenpatico  provided behavioral health services to  members in arizona and  members in kansas  compared to  members in arizona and  members in kansas at december  in january  we began offering pharmacy benefits management through our acquisition of us script  representing most of the increase in consolidated service revenue 
additionally  in may  we expanded our life and health management services through our acquisition of cardium 
in july  we began offering managed vision care through our acquisition of opticare 
in october  our subsidiary  bridgeway health solutions began performing under our long term care contract in arizona 
operating expenses medical costs our medical costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims 
medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties associated with fluctuations in physician billing patterns  membership  products and inpatient hospital trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available 
we employ actuarial professionals and use the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound  we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 
our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred 
our health benefits ratio  or hbr  represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category year ended december  medicaid and schip ssi specialty services our medicaid and schip hbr for the year ended december  was  a decrease of over the decrease is primarily attributable to increased premium yield combined with a moderating medical cost trend particularly with a decrease in retail pharmacy costs 
our medicaid and schip hbr for the year ended december  was  an increase of over the increase in hbr for the year ended december  is caused primarily by increased cost trends for maternity related costs including neonatal intensive care costs  increased physician costs  and increased pharmacy costs 
the increase in the ssi hbr for the year ended december  is a result of the new ssi business in ohio and the transition of these new members into a managed care environment 
the decrease in our specialty services hbr for year ended december  is caused by the diversification of business in that segment 
our specialty services hbr for includes twelve months of the behavioral health contracts in arizona and kansas  six months of opticare and three months of bridgeway 
the results include twelve months of our behavioral health contract in kansas and six months of arizona results 
cost of services our cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager s external revenues 
cost of services also includes all direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues 
these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses associated with facilities and equipment used to provide services 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses  or g a  primarily reflect wages and benefits  including stock compensation expense  and other administrative costs associated with our health plans  specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units 
our major centralized functions are finance  information systems and claims processing 
g a increased in the year ended december  over the comparable period in primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth 
g a in also included charges totaling million for fixed asset impairment  severance for an organizational realignment  and a contribution to our charitable foundation with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of firstguard missouri 
the fixed asset impairment resulted from abandoning our previously planned headquarters development in clayton  missouri 
g a expenses increased in the year ended december  over the comparable period in primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth  especially in arizona and georgia  and the adoption of sfas r on january  the results for the year ended december   include million of implementation expenses in georgia and million of additional stock compensation expense 
our g a expense ratio represents g a expenses as a percentage of the sum of premium revenue and service revenue  and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 
the following table sets forth the g a expense ratios by business segment year ended december  medicaid managed care specialty services the decrease in the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio in primarily reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues offset by the effect of our start up costs in south carolina and for our texas foster care product  and the million charge discussed above 
the increase in the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio in primarily reflects the adoption of sfas r offset by the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues 
the decrease in the specialty services g a expense ratio in primarily reflects the overall leveraging of expenses over higher revenues with the additions of bridgeway and opticare  and the growth of us script s business since the acquisition in january the results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona  the acquisitions of us script and airlogix  as well as the acquisition of cardium effective may   and opticare effective july  the results for the year ended december  include approximately million in implementation costs associated with our long term care contract in arizona

other income expense other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments  our equity in earnings of investments  and interest expense on our debt 
investment and other income increased million in  over the comparable periods in the increase was primarily a result of larger investment balances 
interest expense increased million in  primarily from increased debt 
income tax expense our effective tax rate in was compared to in the decrease was primarily due to the effect of an increase in tax exempt investment income and lower state taxes

regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as managed care organizations  these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus

the purpose of issuing the statement is to replace current guidance in sfas no 
to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction 
the changes to be effected with sfas no 
r from the current guidance include  but are not limited to acquisition costs will be recognized separately from the acquisition  known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value  all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability  contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition  business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as noncontrolling interests  in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values  and a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
sfas no 
r will be effective for any business combinations that occur after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas no 
sfas no 
was issued to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way  that is  as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  sfas no 
eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas no 
will be effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have our financial statements and disclosures 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
medical claims liabilities our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid  or inventory  estimates for claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice 
these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 
our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates 
in developing our estimate for ibnr  we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated 
for more recent periods  incurred non inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors 
incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors 
for older periods  we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates 
the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs 
when we commence operations in a new state or region  we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liabilities 
see risk factors failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our reported results 
these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 
the completion factor  claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factors cost trend factors decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities in thousands in thousands reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused by changes in completion factors 
reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
for example  a increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by million for the year ended december  the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 

table of contents the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balance  december claims inventory  december days in claims payable days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liabilities at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 
the acquisition in includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of opticare 
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider 
as a result  these liabilities generally are described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year 
management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december  will be known by the end of actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions 
moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate 
in many situations  the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development  including changes in medical utilization and cost trends as well as the effect of establishing the liabilities under moderately adverse conditions 
we implement various medical management initiatives in our markets which may contribute to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 
intangible assets we have made several acquisitions since that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets 
these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships  purchased contract rights  provider contracts  trade names and goodwill 
at december   we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
purchased contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to ten years 
provider contracts are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to ten years 
customer relationships are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from five to fifteen years 
trade names are amortized using the straight line method over years 
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be permanently impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  future utility and other internal and external factors  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 

table of contents goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment 
in addition  we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors 
these factors would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
in august  firstguard health plan kansas  inc  or firstguard kansas  our wholly owned subsidiary  received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december  would not be renewed 
as a result of these events  we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit  which encompasses both the kansas and missouri firstguard health plans 
the fair value of our firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value 
the impairment analysis resulted in a total non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million  consisting of million of goodwill and million of other identifiable intangible assets  which was recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  forward looking statements all statements  other than statements of current or historical fact  contained in this filing are forward looking statements 
we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including believe  anticipate  plan  expect  estimate  intend  seek  target  goal  may  will  should  can  continue and other similar words or expressions in connection with  among other things  any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these statements include statements about our market opportunity  our growth strategy  competition  expected activities and future acquisitions  investments and the adequacy of our available cash resources

readers are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including economic  regulatory  competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
all forward looking statements included in this filing are based on information available to us on the date of this filing 
actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors  including our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health benefits and other operating expenses  competition  changes in healthcare practices  changes in federal or state laws or regulations  inflation  provider contract changes  new technologies  reduction in provider payments by governmental payors  major epidemics  disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare  the expiration  cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by state governments  availability of debt and equity financing  on terms that are favorable to us  and general economic and market conditions 
item a risk factors of part i of this filing contains a further discussion of these and other additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations 
we disclaim any current intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
due to these important factors and risks  we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million  including restricted deposits of million 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
the long term investments consist of municipal  corporate and us agency bonds  life insurance contracts  us treasury investments and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year 
restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies 
due to the nature of the states requirements  these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

table of contents inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our margin protection program and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases
