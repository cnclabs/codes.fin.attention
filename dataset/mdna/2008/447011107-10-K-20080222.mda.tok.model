polyurethanes general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals  including mdi products  po  polyols  pg and tpu 
polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams  as well as coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
we focus on the higher margin  higher growth markets for mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi based products for other materials across a broad range of applications 
we operate five primary polyurethanes manufacturing facilities in the us  europe and china 
we also operate polyurethanes formulation facilities  which are located in close proximity to our customers worldwide 
our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate  such as mdi or tdi  with polyols  which are derived largely from po and eo 
while the range of tdi based products is relatively limited  we are able to produce over  distinct mdi based polyurethane products by varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations 
as a result  polyurethane products  especially those derived from mdi  are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end use markets  including insulation in construction and appliances  cushioning for automotive and furniture  adhesives  wood binders  footwear and other specialized engineering applications 
we are a leading north american producer of po 
we and some of our customers process po into derivative products  such as polyols for polyurethane products  pg and various other chemical products 
end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings  construction  appliance  packaging  automotive and transportation  food  paints and coatings and cleaning products industries 
we also produce mtbe as a co product of our po manufacturing process 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below and item a 
risk factors below for a discussion of legal and regulatory developments that have resulted in the curtailment and potential elimination of mtbe in gasoline in the us and elsewhere 
also see  manufacturing and operations below and part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of material changes concerning sales of mtbe 
we sold our us butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment in june  however  the po mtbe operations in our polyurethanes segment were not included in this transaction 
in  we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china 
we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility 
in january  we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai  china 
production at our mdi finishing plant near shanghai  china operated by hps  our consolidated subsidiary  was commissioned on june  production at the mnb  aniline and crude mdi plants operated by slic  our unconsolidated joint venture  commenced on september  these world scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the significant demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience 
products and markets mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized higher value flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
polyols  including polyether and polyester polyols  are used in conjunction with mdi and tdi in rigid foam  flexible foam and other non foam applications 
po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols 
the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals graphic polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products 
depending on their needs  customers will use either commodity polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements 
by varying the blend  additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals  manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products 
mdi 
mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than tdi 
this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications than tdi 
we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued substitution of mdi based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction 
we expect that other markets  such as binders for reconstituted wood board products  specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi 
the us and european markets currently consume the largest quantities of mdi 
with the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies  the asian markets have become an important market for mdi  and we currently believe that per capita demand for mdi in asia will continue to increase as its less developed economies continue to grow 
there are four major global producers of mdi bayer  our company  basf and dow 
while there are also some regional producers in asia and europe  we believe it is unlikely that any new global producers of mdi will emerge in the foreseeable future due to the substantial requirements for entry  such as the limited availability of licenses for mdi technology and the substantial capital commitment and integration that is required to develop both the necessary technology and the infrastructure to manufacture and market mdi 
tpu 
tpu is a high quality  fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability  flexibility  strength  abrasion resistance  shock absorbency and chemical resistance 
we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers 
tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries 
it is also extruded into films  wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyols 
polyols are combined with mdi  tdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products 
demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown 
aniline 
aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi 
generally  most aniline is either consumed internally by the producers of the aniline or is sold to third parties under long term supply contracts 
we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive  mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long term cost competitive aniline supply contract 
po 
po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg 
demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand  especially that of consumer durables 
the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po graphic mtbe 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
the use of mtbe is controversial  and it has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below and item a 
risk factors below 
we continue to sell mtbe for use as a gasoline additive  substantially all of which is sold for use outside the us see manufacturing and operations below and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we manage a global work force  with locations in countries  which sells our polyurethane chemicals to over  customers in more than countries 
our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets  as well as key end use markets that require a more global approach 
these key end use markets include the appliance  automotive  footwear  furniture and coatings  construction products  adhesives  sealants and elastomers industries 
we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components ie  the isocyanate or the polyol or in the form of systems in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers in ready to use form 
our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers needs is critical to our long term success 
we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities  commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as systems houses  close to our customers  enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service 
we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers 
we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers requirements 
we believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts  in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships  have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long term customer supply positions 
due to the specialized nature of our markets  our sales force must possess technical knowledge of our products and their applications 
our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions  quality products  reliable supply  competitive prices and superior customer service 
manufacturing and operations our mdi production facilities are located in geismar  louisiana  rozenburg  netherlands  and  through our joint ventures  shanghai  china 
these facilities receive aniline  which is a primary material used in the production of mdi  from our facilities located in geismar  louisiana  wilton  uk  and shanghai  china 
we believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers 
in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials  integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices 
the following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities mdi polyols tpu aniline nitrobenzene po pg mtbe millions of pounds millions of gallons geismar  louisiana port neches  texas ringwood  illinois rozenburg  netherlands wilton  uk osnabr ck  germany total    in addition to the production referenced  we also are entitled to of the mdi output million pounds from slic  our unconsolidated chinese joint venture 
represents our approximately share of capacity under our rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation 
at both our geismar and rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our mdi 
this technology  which is also used in our chinese joint venture  contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer 
in addition to mdi  we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po 
we own or license all technology  know how and patents developed and utilized at our po facility 
our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation peroxidation reactors  thereby forming tbhp and tba  which are further processed into po and mtbe  respectively 
because our po production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our po co products to be processed into saleable or usable materials  we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives 
we also operate polyurethane systems houses in deerpark  australia  shanghai  china  cartagena  colombia  deggendorf  germany  thane maharashtra  india  ternate  italy  tlalnepantla  mexico  mississauga  ontario  kuan yin  taiwan  samuprakam  thailand  and dammam  saudi arabia through a joint venture 
joint ventures rubicon joint venture 
we and chemtura corporation own rubicon llc  which owns aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa manufacturing facilities in geismar  louisiana 
we are entitled to approximately of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc  and chemtura corporation is entitled to of the dpa production 
in addition to operating the joint venture s owned aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa facilities  rubicon llc also operates our wholly owned mdi and polyol facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex 
as a result of this joint venture  we have been able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain 
we began consolidating rubicon llc in our financial statements as of january  chinese mdi joint ventures 
in january  we entered into two related joint venture agreements to build mdi production facilities near shanghai  china 
slic  our manufacturing joint venture with basf ag and three chinese chemical companies  built three plants that manufacture mnb  aniline and crude mdi 
we effectively own of slic and it is our unconsolidated affiliate 
we are entitled to of the mdi output million pounds annually from slic 
hps  our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor alkali chemical company  ltd  has constructed a plant to manufacture pure mdi  polymeric mdi and mdi variants 
we own of hps and it is our consolidated affiliate 
these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds 
slic and hps commenced operations during the total production capacity of the slic facilities is million pounds per year of mdi and the production capacity of the hps facility is million pounds per year of pure mdi  polymeric mdi and mdi variants 
raw materials the primary raw materials for mdi based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po 
benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline 
historically  benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs 
we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline  almost all of which we then use to produce mdi 
a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po 
the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced  strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products 
the primary raw materials used in our po production process are butane isobutane  propylene  methanol and oxygen  which accounted for   and  respectively  of total raw material costs in we purchase our raw materials primarily under long term contracts 
while most of these feedstocks are commodity materials generally available to us from a wide variety of suppliers at competitive prices in the spot market  all the propylene used in the production of our po is produced internally and delivered through a pipeline connected to our po facility 
competition our major competition in the polyurethane chemicals market includes basf  bayer  dow and lyondellbasell 
while these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals  we focus on mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
we compete based on technological innovation  technical assistance  customer service and product reliability 
our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways where price is the dominant element of competition  our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support including cooperation on technical and safety matters  and elsewhere  we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs 
the market in which our polyurethanes segment operates is highly competitive 
among our competitors in this market are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete

we also purchase amines  polyols  isocyanates  acrylic materials  hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives 
the manufacture of textile effects products requires a wide selection of raw materials approximately  different chemicals  including amines  fluorochemicals and sulfones 
no one raw material represents greater than of our textile effects raw material expenditures 
raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications 
we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers  including  for example  dow 
the terms of our supply contracts vary 
in general  these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased and formula based pricing 
additionally  we produce some of our most important raw materials  such as blr and its basic derivatives  which are the basic building blocks of many of our products 
we are the third largest producer of blr in the world 
approximately of the blr we produce is consumed in the production of our formulated polymer systems 
the balance of our blr is sold as liquid or solid resin in the merchant market  allowing us to increase the utilization of our production plants and lower our overall blr production cost 
we believe that manufacturing a substantial proportion of our principal raw material gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy based polymer systems formulators  most of whom must buy blr from third party suppliers 
this position helps protect us from pricing pressure from blr suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of blr in difficult market conditions 
we consume certain amines produced by our performance products segment and isocyanates produced by our polyurethanes segment  which we use to formulate advanced materials products 
competition the market in which our materials and effects segment operates is highly competitive 
among our competitors in this market are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can

products and markets performance specialties 
the following table shows the end market applications for our performance specialties products product group applications specialty amines liquid soaps  personal care  lubricant and fuel additives  polyurethane foams  fabric softeners  paints and coatings  refinery processing  water treating polyetheramines polyurethane foams and insulation  construction and flooring  paints and coatings  lubricant and fuel additives  adhesives  epoxy composites  agrochemicals  oilfield chemicals ethyleneamines lubricant and fuel additives  epoxy hardeners  wet strength resins  chelating agents  fungicides morpholine dga agent and gas treating hydrocarbon processing  construction chemicals  synthetic rubber  water treating  electronics applications  gas treatment and agriculture carbonates lubricant and fuel additives  agriculture  electronics applications  textile treatment specialty surfactants agricultural herbicides  construction  paper de inking our performance specialties products are organized around the following end markets coatings  polymers and resins  process additives  resources  fuels and lubricants  and agrochemicals 
amines 
amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives 
generally  amines are valued for their properties as a reactive  emulsifying  dispersant  detergent  solvent or corrosion inhibiting agent 
growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets 
however  certain segments of the amines market  such as polyetheramines  have grown at rates well in excess of gdp growth due to new product development  technical innovation  and substitution and replacement of competing products 
for example  polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations  enabling the customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials 
as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer specific end use application  pricing does not generally fluctuate with movements in underlying raw materials 
in  we successfully commissioned and started a new polyetheramine manufacturing facility in singapore with an annual capacity of million pounds 
on december   we signed a memorandum of understanding with the zamil group to form a joint venture to build an ethyleneamines manufacturing facility in jubail industrial city  saudi arabia 
we expect this facility to come on line in early with annual capacity of million pounds 
morpholine dga agent 
morpholine and dga agent are produced as co products by reacting ammonia with deg 
morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing as an accelerator and flocculants for water treatment 
dga agent is primarily used in gas treating  electronics  herbicides and metalworking end use applications 
carbonates 
ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide 
carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications 
they are also increasingly being used as a photo resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards  lcd screens and the production of lithium batteries 
also  propylene carbonates have recently received approval by the us environmental protection agency for use as a solvent in certain agricultural applications 
we expect these solvents to replace traditional aromatic solvents that are increasingly subject to legislative restrictions and prohibitions 
performance intermediates 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our performance intermediates products product group end markets surfactants alkoxylates household detergents  industrial cleaners  anti fog chemicals for glass  asphalt emulsions  shampoos  polymerization additives  de emulsifiers for petroleum production sulfonates sulfates powdered detergents  liquid detergents  shampoos  body washes  dishwashing liquids  industrial cleaners  emulsion polymerization  concrete superplasticizers  gypsum wallboard esters and derivatives shampoo  body wash  textile and leather treatment nitrogen derivatives bleach thickeners  baby shampoo  fabric conditioners  other personal care products formulated blends household detergents  textile and leather treatment  personal care products  pharmaceutical intermediates eo po block co polymers automatic dishwasher detergents ethanolamines wood preservatives  herbicides  construction  gas treatment  metalworking lab consumer detergents  industrial and institutional detergents  synthetic lubricants eg polyester fibers and pet bottle resins  antifreeze surfactants 
surfactants or surface active agents are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule 
while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications  they are also valued for their emulsification  foaming  dispersing  penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries 
demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality 
the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties 
for basic surfactants  pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements 
ethanolamines 
ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia 
they are used as intermediates in the production of a variety of industrial  agricultural and consumer products 
there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry 
growth in this sector has typically been higher than gdp and in the last few years has benefited in particular from the conversion to ethanolamines in the formulation of wood treatment products and higher demand for agriculture products 
we believe the ethanolamines market in north america is tight with industry operating rates currently running in excess of of stated capacity 
during  we expanded the manufacturing capacity of our port neches  texas facility by million pounds per year 
some of our competitors have also announced their intention to debottleneck their facilities to meet the continuing growing demand for ethanolamines 
lab 
lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins 
nearly all the lab produced globally is converted into las  a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer  industrial and institutional laundry detergents 
four major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america procter gamble  henkel  unilever and huish 
we believe that two thirds of the global capacity lies in the hands of seven producers  with two or three major players in each of the three regional markets 
although the north american market for lab is mature  we expect latin america and developing countries in other parts of the world to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than gdp 
from a competition perspective  compounds derived from alcohol and its derivatives can be used in place of lab in certain detergent formulations 
in the past several years  a significant amount of new alcohol production capacity has come on stream resulting in lower prices for these alcohol based compounds 
as a result  lab has become less attractive to buyers who have the option to formulate their products with either of these two raw materials  and as a result  margins for lab producers have come under pressure 
due to this threat  we have developed a high molecular weight alkylate that services the lubricants market 
this has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position 
eg 
we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg meg  deg and teg 
meg is consumed primarily in the polyester fiber and bottle resin and antifreeze end markets 
eg is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants  plasticizers  solvents and emulsifiers 
we continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg 
maleic anhydride and licensing 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our maleic anhydride products product group end markets maleic anhydride boat hulls  automotive  construction  lubricant and fuel additives  countertops  agrochemicals  paper  and food additives maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing maleic anhydride  bdo and pbt manufacturers maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst 
the largest use of maleic anhydride in the us is in the production of uprs  which we believe account for approximately of us maleic anhydride demand 
upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins  which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products 
our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy efficient  high percentage recovery solvent recovery system 
this process competes against two other processes  the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery 
we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery 
the maleic anhydride based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes  which include po  butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks 
as a result  the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst 
total us demand for maleic anhydride is approximately million pounds 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  demand for this application can be cyclical 
pricing for maleic anhydride in north america over the past several years has been increasing 
generally  changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs  however in pricing was driven more by the latter 
on february   we announced a proposal to build a new million pounds per year maleic anhydride facility at our geismar  louisiana site 
we expect the new facility to come on stream during the fourth quarter of sales and marketing we sell over  products to over  customers globally through our performance products marketing groups  which have extensive market knowledge  considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships 
our performance specialties markets are organized around end use market applications  such as coatings  polymers and resins and agrochemical 
in these end uses  our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications 
we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for on going differentiation in our development activities with our customers 
our performance intermediates and maleic anhydride markets organize their marketing efforts around their products and geographic regions served 
we also provide extensive pre and post sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements 
finally  these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies 
in addition to our focused direct sales efforts  we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products 
these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces 
manufacturing and operations our performance products segment has the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds annually of a wide variety of specialty  intermediate and commodity products and formulations at manufacturing locations in north america  europe and australia 
these production capacities are as follows current capacity product area north america europe asia pacific total millions of pounds performance specialties amines specialty surfactants carbonates performance intermediates ethylene propylene eo   eg surfactants   ethanolamines lab maleic anhydride includes up to million pounds of ethyleneamines that are made available from dow s terneuzen  netherlands facility by way of a long term supply arrangement 
represents total capacity of a facility owned by sasol huntsman gmbh co 
kg  of which we own a equity interest and sasol owns the remaining interest 
our surfactants and amines facilities are located globally  with broad capabilities in amination  sulfonation and ethoxylation 
these facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation 
through the major restructuring of our surfactant operations  we have significantly improved the competitiveness of our surfactants business 
our primary ethylene  propylene  eo  eg and ethanolamines facilities are located in port neches  texas 
the port neches  texas facility benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure  which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products 
our lab facility in chocolate bayou  texas and our maleic anhydride facility in pensacola  florida are both located within large  integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes operated by solutia 
we believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand alone operations 
raw materials we have the capacity to use approximately million pounds of ethylene each year produced in part at our port neches  texas facility in the production of eo and ethyleneamines 
we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg  surfactants and amines products 
we also use internally produced po and deg in the manufacture of these products 
we have the capacity to produce million pounds of ethylene and million pounds of propylene at our port neches  texas facility 
all of the ethylene is used in the production of eo and substantially all of the propylene is consumed by the po unit at port neches operated by our polyurethanes business 
we purchase the remainder of our ethylene and propylene requirements from third parties 
in addition to internally produced raw materials  our performance specialties market purchases over compounds in varying quantities  the largest of which includes ethylene dichloride  caustic soda  synthetic alcohols  paraffin  nonyl phenol  ammonia  methylamines and acrylonitrile 
the majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices 
in our performance intermediates market  our primary raw materials  in addition to internally produced and third party sourced eo and ethylene  are synthetic and natural alcohols  paraffin  benzene and nonyl phenol 
all of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices 
maleic anhydride is produced by the reaction of n butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst 
the principal raw material is n butane which is purchased pursuant to long term contracts and delivered to our pensacola  florida site by barge 
our maleic anhydride catalyst is toll manufactured by basf under a long term contract according to our proprietary methods 
these raw materials are available from multiple sources at competitive prices 
competition in our performance specialties market  there are few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of product formulations  the proprietary nature of many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved 
some of our global competitors include basf  air products  dow and akzo 
we compete primarily on the basis of product performance  new product innovation and  to a lesser extent  on the basis of price 
there are numerous global producers of many of our performance intermediates products 
our main competitors include global companies such as dow  sasol  basf  petresa  equistar  shell  cognis  stepan and kao  as well as various smaller or more local competitors 
we compete on the basis of price with respect to the majority of our product offerings and  to a lesser degree  on the basis of product availability  performance and service with respect to certain of our more value added products 
in our maleic anhydride market  we compete primarily on the basis of price  customer service and plant location 
our competitors include lanxess  koch  marathon  polynt and basf 
we are the leading global producer of maleic anhydride catalyst 
competitors in our maleic anhydride catalyst market include scientific design and polynt 
in our maleic anhydride technology licensing market  our primary competitor is scientific design 
we compete primarily on the basis of technological performance and service 
the market in which our performance products segment operates is highly competitive 
among our competitors in this market are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
pigments general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of titanium dioxide  which is a white pigment used to impart whiteness  brightness and opacity to products such as paints  plastics  paper  printing inks  fibers and ceramics 
we operate eight chloride based and sulfate based titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities located in north america  europe  asia and africa 
the global titanium dioxide market is characterized by a small number of large  global producers and a growing compliment of smaller regional producers 
we offer an extensive range of products that are sold worldwide to approximately  customers in all major titanium dioxide end markets and geographic regions 
the geographic diversity of our manufacturing facilities allows our pigments segment to service local customers  as well as global customers that require delivery to more than one location 
our diverse customer base includes ampacet  a 
schulman  akzo nobel  basf  cabot  clariant  jotun  polyone and ppg 
our pigments business has an aggregate annual nameplate capacity of approximately  tonnes at our eight production facilities 
five of our titanium dioxide manufacturing plants are located in europe  one is in north america  one is in asia  and one is in south africa 
our north american operation consists of a interest in a manufacturing joint venture with kronos worldwide  inc our pigments segment is focused on improving our competitive position 
we are currently undertaking a broad based business performance improvement program called titan 
under titan  we are expanding our greatham  uk chloride based facility by to  tonnes per annum capacity 
we are also introducing a number of innovative new products to the market and carrying out a number of projects to further improve manufacturing costs at each of our facilities 
products and markets historically  global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global gdp growth rates 
however  the demand growth rate and its relationship with the gdp growth rate varies by region 
developed markets such as the us and western europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates  while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates 
the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end use markets 
coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere  resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year 
there are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide  the sulfate process and the chloride process 
most recent capacity additions by the five major producers have employed the chloride process technology while those by smaller producers have generally used the sulphate process technology 
we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately of global production capacity 
however  the global distribution of sulfate and chloride based titanium dioxide capacity varies by region  with the sulfate process being predominant in europe  our primary market 
the chloride process is the predominant process used in north america  and both processes are used in asia 
while most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  regional market preferences typically favor products that are locally available 
we believe the chloride and sulfate manufacturing processes compete effectively in the marketplace 
the titanium dioxide industry currently has five major producers and a large number of small regional or local producers 
titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks and efficiency improvements 
during periods of low titanium dioxide demand  the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital 
pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply demand balance 
based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning  governmental approvals and construction  we do not expect significant additional greenfield capacity in the near future 
longer term dupont has announced that it plans to construct a greenfield plant in china for start up in or beyond to supply the rapidly growing chinese market 
sales and marketing approximately of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our direct sales and technical services network  enabling us to cooperate more closely with our customers and to respond to our increasingly global customer base 
our concentrated sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve our leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium dioxide 
in addition  we have focused on marketing products to higher growth industries 
for example  we believe that our pigments business is well positioned to benefit from the projected growth in the plastics sector which we expect to grow faster than the overall titanium dioxide market over the next several years 
manufacturing and operations our pigments business has eight manufacturing sites in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately  tonnes per year 
approximately of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in western europe 
the following table presents information regarding our titanium dioxide facilities region site annual capacity tonnes process western europe greatham  uk calais  france huelva  spain scarlino  italy grimsby  uk   chloride sulfate sulfate sulfate sulfate north america lake charles  louisiana  chloride asia teluk kalung  malaysia  sulfate southern africa umbogintwini  south africa  sulfate total  this facility is owned and operated by louisiana pigment company  lp  a manufacturing joint venture that is owned by us and by kronos worldwide 
the capacity shown reflects our interest in louisiana pigment company lp we are currently expanding our greatham  uk facility by  tonnes 
we are also well positioned to selectively invest in new plant capacity based upon our icon chloride technology 
icon technology allows for the construction of new capacity with world scale economics at a minimum nameplate size of  tonnes 
we believe competing chloride technologies typically require a minimum capacity of  tonnes to achieve comparable economics 
our chloride additions can be more easily absorbed into the market  which provides higher investment returns than larger capacity additions 
joint venture we own a interest in louisiana pigment company lp  a manufacturing joint venture located in lake charles  louisiana 
the remaining interest is held by our joint venture partner  kronos worldwide 
we share production offtake and operating costs of the plant equally with kronos worldwide  though we market our share of the production independently 
the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation 
our investment in louisiana pigment company lp is accounted for using the equity method 
raw materials the primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium bearing ores 
we purchase the majority of our ore under long term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers 
the majority of titanium bearing ores are sourced from australia  south africa and canada 
ore accounts for approximately of pigment variable manufacturing costs  while utilities electricity  gas and steam  sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately of our variable manufacturing costs 
the world market for titanium bearing ores is dominated by rio tinto and iluka  which account for approximately of global supply 
both companies produce a range of ores for use in chloride and sulphate processes 
we purchase approximately of our ore from these two producers 
the dominance of these producers has diminished in recent years with the entry into the market of new producers such as ticor and namakwa in south africa  vvm in india  and sierra rutile in sierra leone 
recent strong demand growth  especially in china  has led to a re tightening of the market and prices have been rising 
we have broadened our supply base by purchasing increasing amounts of our ores from the new suppliers 
over of our ore purchases are made under agreements with terms of three or more years 
titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process 
once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced  it is finished into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications 
the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product s performance characteristics 
the sulfate process generally uses less refined ores that are cheaper to purchase but produce more co product than the chloride process 
co products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations 
in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness  we have developed and marketed the co products of our pigments business 
we sell over of the co products generated by our business 
competition the global markets in which our pigments business operate are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price 
in addition  we also compete on the basis of product quality and service 
the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont  tronox  kronos and cristal  each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets 
some of our competitors may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
moreover  the sulphate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments business is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing 
we believe that our competitive product offerings  combined with our presence in numerous local markets  makes us an effective competitor in the global market  particularly with respect to those global customers demanding presence in the various regions in which they conduct business 
polymers and base chemicals on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which flint hills resources  a wholly owned subsidiary of koch  agreed to acquire our north american base chemicals and polymers business assets for million in cash  plus the value of inventory on the date of closing 
the original agreement provided that we would retain other elements of working capital  including accounts receivable  accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities  which would then be liquidated for cash in the ordinary course of business

on august   we closed the north american polymers disposition  and  on november   we closed on the us base chemicals disposition following the successful restart of our port arthur  texas facility 
we received total consideration for the us petrochemicals disposition of million  which is subject to post closing adjustments 
the net proceeds from the us petrochemicals disposition were used to repay borrowings under our revolving facility  repay other debt and reduce amounts under the a r securitization program 
for more information  see recent developments sale of us base chemicals and polymers business above 
prior to the us petrochemicals disposition  our polymers segment produced ldpe and lldpe  polypropylene  eps  styrene and apao and our base chemicals segment produced olefins and cyclohexane 
research and development for the years ended december   and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research and development 
we support our business with a major commitment to research and development  technical services and process engineering improvement 
our research and development centers are located in the woodlands  texas and everberg  belgium 
other regional development technical service centers are located in billingham  england pigments  auburn hills  michigan polyurethanes for the automotive industry  derry  new hampshire  shanghai  china  deggendorf  germany and ternate  italy polyurethanes  melbourne  australia surfactants  port neches  texas process engineering support  and basel  switzerland textile effects 
intellectual property rights proprietary protection of our processes  apparatuses  and other technology and inventions is important to our businesses 
we own approximately unexpired us patents  approximately patent applications including provisionals currently pending at the us patent and trademark office  and approximately  foreign counterparts  including both issued patents and pending patent applications 
while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued us patents  we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application  or that if patents do issue  that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
additionally  our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance  however  that confidentiality agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know how  or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know how 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
in addition to our own patents and patent applications and proprietary trade secrets and know how  we are a party to certain licensing arrangements and other agreements authorizing us to use trade secrets  know how and related technology and or operate within the scope of certain patents owned by other entities 
we also have licensed or sub licensed intellectual property rights to third parties 
we have associated brand names with a number of our products  and we have approximately us trademark registrations including applications for registration currently pending at the us patent and trademark office  and approximately  foreign counterparts  including both registrations and applications for registration 
however  there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors  or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted 
because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business  we do not believe that any single intellectual property right other than certain trademark rights which are not subject to termination so long as the applicable registrations are maintained is material to our business 
moreover  we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years  either individually or in the aggregate  will materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  people in our operations around the world 
approximately  of these employees are located in the us  while approximately  are located in other countries 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
environmental  health and safety matters general we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to safety  pollution  protection of the environment and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities 
in addition  our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal  modification and  in certain circumstances  revocation 
actual or alleged violations of safety laws  environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some environmental laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
environmental  health and safety systems we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental  health and safety ehs legal requirements  and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations  enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements  ensure the safety of our employees  contractors  community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants 
although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with  these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and minimizing overall risk to us 
ehs capital expenditures we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws  including costs to acquire  maintain and repair pollution control equipment 
for the years ended december   and  our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled million  million and million  respectively 
since capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend  in part  on the timing  promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements  we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required under ehs laws 
remediation liabilities we have incurred  and we may in the future incur  liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials 
similarly  we may incur costs for the cleanup of wastes that were disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses 
under some circumstances  the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources 
under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  and similar state laws  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred  and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release 
we have been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at approximately former facilities or third party sites  including  but not limited to  sites listed under cercla 
based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites  we do not expect any of these third party claims to result in material liability to us 
in addition  under the us resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended rcra  and similar state laws  we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit 
some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use  including on site waste disposal 
we are aware of soil  groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites  and we may find contamination at other sites in the future 
for example  our port neches  texas and geismar  louisiana facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements under rcra authority 
in june of  an agreement was reached between the local regulatory authorities and our advanced materials site in pamplona  spain to relocate our manufacturing operations in order to facilitate new urban development desired by the city 
subsequently  as required by the authorities  soil and groundwater sampling was performed and followed by a quantitative risk assessment 
although unresolved at this time  some level of remediation of site contamination may be required in the future  but the estimated cost is unknown because the remediation approach and timing has not been determined 
by letter dated march   our base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray  australia was issued a clean up notice by the australian victorian epa 
the agency was concerned about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site 
although we fulfilled all initial requirements under the clean up notice  the agency revoked the original clean up notice on september  and issued a revised clean up notice granting an extension due to the complexity of contamination issues at the site 
the revised clean up notice reflects a more detailed program  with a deadline for the submission of a detailed site remediation action plan by march  in many cases  our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility 
in these situations  we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre closing conditions 
we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and  where applicable  mitigated our ultimate remediation liability 
we cannot assure you  however  that all of such matters will be subject to indemnity  that the prior owner will honor its indemnity or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters 
based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available  we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if such indemnities are unavailable or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs  and if such costs are material  then such expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the full cost  exclusive of indemnification benefits  to remediate any of the known contamination sites 
environmental reserves we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties 
liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our liability estimates are based upon available facts  existing technology and past experience and are not discounted 
the environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations 
we have accrued million and million for environmental liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million are classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively  and million and million are classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
in certain cases  our remediation liabilities are payable over periods of up to years 
we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess 
regulatory developments under the eu s integrated pollution prevention and control directive ippc  eu member governments are to adopt rules and implement a cross media air  water and waste environmental permitting program for individual facilities 
while the eu countries are at varying stages in their respective implementation of the ippc permit program  we have submitted all necessary ippc permit applications required to date and in some cases received completed permits from the applicable government agency 
we expect to submit all other ippc applications and related documents on a timely basis as the various countries implement the ippc permit program 
although we do not know with certainty what each ippc permit will require  we believe  based upon our experience with the permits received to date  that the costs of compliance with the ippc permit program will not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the eu parliament and eu council approved a new eu regulatory framework for chemicals called reach registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals 
reach took effect on june   and the program it establishes will be phased in over years 
under the regulation  companies that manufacture or import more than one ton of a chemical substance per year will be required to register such chemical substances and isolated intermediates in a central database 
use authorizations will be granted for a specific chemical if the applicants can show that any risk in using the chemical can be adequately controlled or  where there are no suitable alternatives available  if the applicant can demonstrate that the social and economic benefits of using the chemical outweigh the risks 
in addition  specified uses of some hazardous substances may be restricted 
furthermore  all applicants will have to study the availability of alternative chemicals 
if an alternative is available  an applicant will have to submit a substitution plan to the regulatory agency 
the regulatory agency will only authorize persistent bio accumulative and toxic substances if an alternative chemical is not available 
the registration  evaluation and authorization phases of the program will require expenditures and resource commitments in order to  for example  develop information technology tools  generate data  prepare and submit dossiers for substance registration  participate in consortia  obtain legal advice and reformulate products  if necessary 
we have established a cross business european reach team that is working closely with our businesses to identify and list all substances purchased  manufactured or imported by or for us into the eu 
although the total long term cost for reach compliance is not estimable at this time  we spent approximately million on reach compliance in  and we do not anticipate that compliance costs will be material to us in the near term 
greenhouse gas regulation in the eu and other jurisdictions committed to compliance with the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the convention  there is an increasing likelihood that our manufacturing sites will be affected in some way over the next few years by regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
in addition  although the us is not a signatory to the convention  several states  including california  are implementing their own ghg regulatory programs  and a federal program in the us is a possibility for the future 
several of our sites are subject to existing ghg legislation  but few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result  although it is likely that ghg emission restrictions will increase over time 
potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets used to meet ghg restriction and or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation  as well as direct compliance costs 
currently  however  it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites 
chemical facility anti terrorism rulemaking as required by the homeland security appropriations act of  on april   the department of homeland security issued the chemical facility anti terrorism standards or cfats  an interim final rule establishing risk based performance standards for the chemical industry 
the majority of the standards went into effect on june  and require security vulnerability assessments and site security plans for facilities qualifying as high risk 
since  we have conducted security vulnerability assessments at our higher risk manufacturing facilities in the us those assessments led to changes in our operations in certain instances in an effort to ensure greater security 
however  not all of our facilities  including some of our recently acquired sites  have been assessed 
this second round of security vulnerability assessments under the cfats regime will be based on the list of chemicals of interest appendix a released on november  and will incorporate the volume of on site chemicals  proximity of neighbors to a facility and other measures 
our operating locations with appendix a chemicals meeting the volume thresholds prepared and submitted the required initial reports by the january  submission deadline 
we expect that the cost to perform the assessments is nominal 
at this time  we do not know if we will need to implement any changes to our facilities based on the findings of the assessments  or what the nature or cost of such changes  if any  will be 
mtbe developments we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
as a result of these developments  we currently market  either directly or through third parties  mtbe to customers located outside the us for use as a gasoline additive 
there are additional costs associated with sales to customers outside the us  which may result in decreased profitability compared to sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in approximately cases currently pending in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
in march  we were named for the first time as a defendant in eight of those lawsuits 
we learned that we were named in a ninth such lawsuit in january for more information  see item legal proceedings mtbe litigation 
the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 
we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases 
we believe that some of our liability in these cases  if any  is likely covered by insurance and or indemnity agreements with prior owners 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in additional existing or future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position

risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to the merger any failure to complete the merger could materially adversely impact the market price of our common stock as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
consummation of the merger is subject to our and hexion s performance under the merger agreement and a number of closing conditions 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  the price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects market assumptions that the merger will be completed and the premium implied by the merger consideration will be realized 
we may also be subject to additional risks  including the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement with hexion  or the failure of the merger to close for any other reason  under the terms of the merger agreement  in certain circumstances we could be required to pay significant fees in connection with a termination of the merger agreement  which would be in addition to the termination fee the basell termination fee that we paid under an agreement and plan of merger we entered into with basell the basell agreement  for which we would be solely responsible  our management having spent a significant amount of their time and efforts directed toward the merger and the related transactions  which time and efforts otherwise would have been spent on our business and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us  costs relating to the merger and related transactions  such as legal  accounting and filing fees  much of which must be paid regardless of whether the merger is completed  uncertainties relating to the merger and related transactions may adversely affect our relationships with our employees  vendors and customers  and the outcome of any litigation or judicial actions that have been or may be instituted against us  our board of directors and others relating to the merger agreement or any settlement of such litigation or judicial actions 
accordingly  investors should not place undue reliance on the occurrence of the merger 
in addition  if the merger does not occur  there can be no assurance that a comparable transaction will be consummated that results in investors shares being purchased 
the realization of any of these risks may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or the market price of our common stock 
if the banks that have provided commitment letters for the funds to complete the merger are not required or refuse to fund  hexion will have to seek other financing to complete the merger  which financing may not be available 
hexion has obtained commitment letters for senior secured credit facilities and a senior secured bridge facility with affiliates of credit suisse and deutsche bank ag to be made available to hexion and or one or more of its subsidiaries for purposes of  among other things  financing the merger consideration 
hexion s ability to draw on the proposed loan facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
under the merger agreement  hexion s obligation to consummate the merger  however  is not conditioned upon receipt or availability of financing 
although hexion expects that it will be able to draw on the proposed loan facility  in the event hexion is unable to do so  hexion will be forced to seek substitute financing to raise the necessary funds to pay the merger consideration 
such substitute financing may be unavailable 
in addition  while hexion is owned by affiliates of apollo management  lp  apollo management  lp is not obligated to contribute additional equity to us or hexion in order to consummate the merger 
for more information  see recent developments pending sale of our company above 
necessary consents and approvals from government entities may delay or prevent the closing of the merger 
the merger is conditioned upon  among other things  receipt of regulatory approvals or expiration of required waiting periods in the united states  the european union and several other jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance when any such approvals will be obtained or when such waiting periods will expire  if at all 
as a result  stockholders face the risk that the completion of the merger may be delayed or that the merger may not be completed 
the period of time expected before completing the merger may increase the risk that we inadvertently fail to comply with our covenants  including those that restrict our conduct of business or that a material adverse effect occurs in our business which would permit hexion to refuse to consummate the merger 
the merger is subject to obtaining the required regulatory clearances and approvals and other conditions beyond our control that may delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion 
we cannot predict when these conditions will be satisfied 
further  the period of time necessary to satisfy the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could significantly delay the effective time of the merger which would increase the risk that we inadvertently fail to comply with our covenants  including those that restrict our conduct of business or that there arises an occurrence  condition  change or event that would constitute a material adverse effect under the terms of the merger agreement  which would permit hexion to refuse to consummate the merger 
we could incur substantial merger related costs in connection with the merger 
we expect to incur a number of non recurring costs associated with completing the merger 
these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our reported results before the consummation of the merger 
the pendency of the merger could materially adversely affect our business and operations 
in connection with the pending merger  some of our vendors  customers and strategic partners may delay or defer decisions relating to their ongoing and future relationships with us  which could negatively affect our revenues  earnings and cash flows and adversely affect our prospects which could be detrimental to our stockholders if the merger is not consummated 
uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of employees and may otherwise materially adversely affect our business and operations 
our future results of operations will depend in part upon our ability to retain existing highly skilled and qualified employees and to attract new employees 
a number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians  and failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could materially adversely affect our ability to compete 
in addition  current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the effective time of the merger 
this uncertainty may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing  technical and other personnel 
this inability to retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate the business as a stand alone enterprise in the event the merger is not consummated 
in certain circumstances  the merger agreement requires us to pay hexion a termination fee of million plus an amount equal to million the reimbursement amount  representing the portion of the million termination fee paid to basell that was funded by hexion  and  any such payment could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations 
under the merger agreement  we may be required to pay to hexion a termination fee of million and the reimbursement amount of million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances 
should the merger agreement be terminated in circumstances under which the termination fee and reimbursement amount are payable  the payment could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations after such time 
the merger agreement contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities 
the merger agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or raise additional capital  purchase equity interests or redeem indebtedness early  create or incur certain liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries  and sell or acquire assets or businesses 
although the merger agreement provides that hexion will not unreasonably withhold its consent to us taking otherwise prohibited actions  there can be no assurances that hexion will grant such consent 
the requirement that we comply with these provisions prior to the merger may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions  take advantage of business opportunities  obtain future financing  fund needed capital expenditures  or finance equipment purchases  any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the prospects of our business  which could be detrimental to our stockholders in the event the merger is not consummated 
rating agencies could downgrade their corporate debt ratings for us before the effective time of the merger 
such downgrades could have a material adverse effect on the ongoing cost of financing our business 
some rating agencies that provide corporate ratings on us or provide ratings on our debt may downgrade their corporate or debt ratings with respect to us in light of the pending merger and the financing thereof 
a downgrade could materially adversely affect our ability to finance our operations  including increasing the cost of obtaining financing under existing or future facilities or of debt securities  and may effect the payment terms offered by vendors which could result in a negative impact on our liquidity 
risks related to the ownership of our common stock our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues  including broad market factors that may have a material adverse impact on our stock price  regardless of actual performance 
the most significant factors that are likely to effect our stock price are events  expectations and market perceptions that relate to the likelihood and timing of the consummation of the merger 
in addition  the following factors could effect our stock price periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of our competitors  material announcements by us or our competitors  public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate 
shares available for future sale may cause our common stock price to decline  which may negatively impact your investment 
sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may cause prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock to decline 
pursuant to a voting agreement  matlinpatterson has the right to dispose of  shares of our common stock  subject to the requirement that either we agree that certain criteria are satisfied or the new owner grants all voting rights with respect to the purchased shares to hmp equity trust or to jon m 
huntsman 
in addition  we have filed a registration statement to permit sales of our common stock by other stockholders who hold an aggregate of  shares or approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
any sales of our shares of common stock may negatively impact your investment 
if the merger agreement is terminated  or with the consent of hexion  we have the ability to issue additional equity securities  which would lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities would result in dilution of then existing stockholders equity interests in us 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine  with respect to any series of preferred stock  the number of shares in that series and the terms  rights and limitations of that series 
if we issue convertible preferred stock  a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders interest 
our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock  but reserves the right to do so in the future  subject to restrictions set forth in the merger agreement 
in addition  subject to restrictions set forth in the merger agreement  we may issue additional shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
in addition to provisions of the merger agreement  certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction other than the merger and  therefore  your ability to sell your shares at a price higher than contemplated by the merger 
in addition to provisions of the merger agreement  certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board of directors  limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party other than hexion to acquire control of our company  even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
although the terms of the merger agreement restrict our ability to issue preferred stock  if the merger agreement is terminated  or if hexion consents  our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell your shares of common stock at a price higher than contemplated by the merger 
risks related to mtbe existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability  materially reduce our sales and or materially increase our costs 
we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
as a result of these developments  we currently market  either directly or through third parties  mtbe to customers located outside the us for use as a gasoline additive 
there are additional costs associated with sales to customers outside the us  which may result in decreased profitability compared to sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in approximately cases currently pending in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
in march  we were named for the first time as a defendant in eight of those lawsuits 
we learned that we were named in a ninth such case in january the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 
we currently have insufficient information to meaningfully assess our potential exposure in these cases 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in additional existing or future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
other risks significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers  which could reduce our profitability 
the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile 
we purchase a substantial portion of these raw materials from third party suppliers  and  following the us petrochemicals disposition and our other recent dispositions  our purchases from third party suppliers have significantly increased 
the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of  and vary with market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas feedstocks  which are highly volatile and cyclical 
the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are generally commodity products that are readily available at market prices 
nevertheless  we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers where we believe such agreements will reduce our costs 
in some cases  the existence of pipelines or the proximity of suppliers may provide significant cost benefits to us 
disruptions of existing supply arrangements could substantially impact our profitability 
if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements  we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs 
in addition  if any of the raw materials that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced  then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes 
any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues  which could reduce our cash flow 
our supply agreements typically provide for market based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases  we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all 
timing differences between raw material prices  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow 
any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and or nonperformance by our customers 
our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to eliminate customer credit risk 
our customers may experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcies  restructurings and liquidations 
these and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers  as well as potential financial weakness in our industry  may increase our risk in extending trade credit to customers 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane  fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or man made disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses 
if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities  it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas 
a disaster in one of these regions could have a material adverse impact on our operations  operating results and financial condition 
we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future 
we incurred net losses in five of the last six fiscal years 
our history of net losses may have a negative impact on our business  including our ability to fund operations  make capital expenditures and service debt obligations 
persistent continued net losses likely would negatively affect our ability to meet such obligations over the long term 
our history of net losses may also increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult and or expensive to take advantage of opportunities for growth 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and international business risks 
we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the us  and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these risks include the need to convert currencies which may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 
in addition  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer us dollars 
because we currently have significant operations located outside the united states  we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements 
other risks of international operations include trade barriers  tariffs  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political risks  general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws  including tax laws 
furthermore  in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from country to country  we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements 
in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary  we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems 
the occurrence of these risks could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries  which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us 
demand for many of our products is cyclical  and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products 
historically  the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods of capacity additions  resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins 
the industries in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
among our competitors are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
moreover  certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low in certain product segments of our business  and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing 
further  petroleum rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future 
increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products  which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs  which could reduce our profitability 
although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of differentiated and commodity chemical products 
these hazards include chemical spills  pipeline leaks and ruptures  storage tank leaks  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing  processing  handling  transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals 
we are also potentially subject to other hazards  including natural disasters and severe weather  explosions and fires  transportation problems  including interruptions  spills and leaks  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  remediation complications  and other risks 
many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 
furthermore  we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby  workers compensation and other matters 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 
we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance policies and products liability and sudden and accidental insurance policies  as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks  including pollution legal liability insurance 
each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions  deductibles and coverage limits  in accordance with industry standards and practices 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business 
in conjunction with many of our past acquisitions  we have obtained indemnity agreements from the prior owners addressing liabilities that may arise from operations and events prior to our ownership 
we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings 
it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
we are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some environmental laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
see item business environmental  health and safety matters and item legal proceedings 
in addition  we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws 
capital expenditures and costs relating to environmental or safety matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations 
capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future environmental or safety laws 
furthermore  we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated our purchase of our businesses 
we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future environmental laws 
see item business environmental  health and safety matters and item legal proceedings 
our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our significant leverage  which could restrict our ability to grow our businesses 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding 
as of december   we had total consolidated outstanding indebtedness of approximately billion including the current portion of long term debt and a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 
this balance does not reflect approximately million under our off balance sheet a r securitization program at december  our outstanding debt could have important consequences for our businesses  including a high degree of debt makes us more vulnerable to a downturn in our businesses  our industry or the economy in general  as a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations will be required to make payments on our indebtedness  making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions  a substantial portion of our future cash flow from operations may be required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  including the growth of our businesses  our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained due to our existing level of debt  and part of our indebtedness is  and any future debt may be  subject to variable interest rates  which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
we require substantial capital to finance our operations and continued growth  and we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time for a variety of purposes  including acquiring additional businesses 
however  our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants 
among other things  these covenants limit or prohibit our ability to incur more debt  make prepayments of other debt  pay dividends  redeem stock or make other distributions  issue capital stock  make investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets 
also  if we undergo a change of control  our debt instruments may require us to make an offer to purchase certain of our notes 
under these circumstances  we may also be required to repay indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities senior credit facilities prior to our notes 
in this event  we may not have the financial resources necessary to purchase such notes  which would result in an event of default under the indentures governing such notes 
as of december   the current portion of our long term debt totaled approximately million 
for  without giving consideration to the merger  we estimate that our annual aggregate debt service expense will be approximately million  which will include approximately million in amortization of capitalized debt costs 
as of december   we had combined outstanding variable rate borrowings of approximately billion 
assuming a increase in interest rates  without giving effect to any interest rate hedges  our annual interest rate expense would increase by approximately million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to meet payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of those instruments 
in the event of a default  a holder of the indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest  the creditors under our senior credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and we or one or more of our subsidiaries  could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us  then we will not be able to make payment on our debts 
generally  our debt is the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and the guarantors of such debt and not of any of our other subsidiaries 
because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by these other subsidiaries  our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness  including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity  are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from non guarantor subsidiaries 
any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our non guarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law  monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate  and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our non guarantor subsidiaries 
in addition  payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our non guarantor subsidiaries earnings 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and  except for our guarantor subsidiaries  have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds available therefor  whether by dividends  loans  distributions or other payments  and do not guarantee the payment of interest on  or principal of  our debt 
any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary  and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets  will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary 
a downgrade in the ratings of the securities of our company or our subsidiaries could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings of our company or our subsidiaries and could restrict our access to additional capital or trade credit 
standard and poor s ratings services and moody s investors service maintain credit ratings for us 
each of these ratings is currently below investment grade 
any decision by these or other ratings agencies to downgrade such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating to our future borrowings and could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms 
in addition  any downgrade could restrict our access to  and negatively impact the terms of  trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials 
future acquisitions  partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and or result in unanticipated adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the future we may seek to grow our company and businesses by making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures 
any future acquisition  partnership or joint venture may require that we make a significant cash investment  issue stock or incur substantial debt 
in addition  acquisitions  partnerships or investments may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
these capital  equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses 
any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities  could entail a number of additional risks  including problems with effective integration of operations  the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  and difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings 
we have incurred indebtedness to finance past acquisitions 
we may finance future acquisitions with additional indebtedness 
we could face the financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing our liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business is dependent on our intellectual property 
if our patents are declared invalid or our trade secrets become known to our competitors  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
proprietary protection of our processes  apparatuses and other technology is important to our business 
consequently  we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights 
while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the us  there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property  then our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
additionally  our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  these confidentiality agreements may be breached  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know how  or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets or proprietary know how could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management 
if any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his present role and is not adequately replaced  our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted 
we generally do not have employment agreements with  and we do not maintain any key man life insurance for  any of our executive officers 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   the continuing military action in iraq  general instability in various opec member and other energy producing nations  the threat of other attacks or acts of war in the us and abroad and increased security regulations related to our industry could adversely affect our business 
the attacks of september   and subsequent events  including the continuing military action in iraq  have caused instability in the us and other financial markets and have led  and may continue to lead  to further armed hostilities  prolonged military action in iraq  or further acts of terrorism in the us or abroad  which could cause further instability in financial markets 
current regional tensions and conflicts in various opec member and other energy producing nations  including the continuing military action in iraq  have caused  and may cause further  increases in raw material costs  particularly natural gas and crude oil based feedstocks  which are used in our operations 
the uncertainty surrounding the threat of further armed hostilities  military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  europe  australia  asia  africa  south america and the middle east  or those of our customers 
furthermore  the terrorist attacks  subsequent events and future developments in any of these areas may result in reduced demand from our customers for our products 
in addition  local  state and federal governments have begun a regulatory process that could lead to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals  which could result in higher operating costs 
these developments will subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity

item legal proceedings discoloration claims certain claims have been filed against us relating to discoloration of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride products allegedly caused by our titanium dioxide discoloration claims 
substantially all of the titanium dioxide that is the subject of these claims was manufactured prior to our acquisition of the titanium dioxide business from ici in net of amounts we have received from insurers and pursuant to contracts of indemnity  we have paid an aggregate of approximately million in costs and settlement amounts for discoloration claims through december  during the year ended december   we paid million approximately million in partial settlement of a claim 
we have formally requested reimbursement of ici in accordance with our agreement 
during the year ended december   we did not settle any discoloration claims 
during the year ended december   we settled a claim for approximately million  all of which was paid by ici 
the two discoloration claims unresolved as of december  asserted aggregate damages of approximately million approximately million 
an appropriate liability has been accrued for these claims 
based on our understanding of the merits of these claims and our rights under contracts of indemnity and insurance  we do not believe that the net impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity will be material 
while additional discoloration claims may be made in the future  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of loss related to such claims 
although we may incur additional costs as a result of future claims including settlement costs  based on our history with discoloration claims to date  the fact that substantially all of the titanium dioxide that has been the subject of these discoloration claims was manufactured and sold more than eight years ago  and the fact that we have rights under contract to indemnity  including from ici  we do not believe that any unasserted discoloration claims will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
based on this conclusion and our inability to reasonably estimate our expected costs with respect to these unasserted claims  we have made no accruals in our financial statements as of december  for costs associated with unasserted discoloration claims 
environmental enforcement proceedings on occasion  we receive notices of violation  enforcement or other complaints from regulatory agencies alleging non compliance with applicable ehs laws 
based on currently available information and our past experience  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened environmental enforcement proceedings will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the state of texas settled an air enforcement case with us relating to our port arthur plant 
under the settlement  we were required to pay a civil penalty of million over more than four years  undertake environmental monitoring projects totaling about million in costs  and pay million in attorneys fees to the texas attorney general 
as of december   we have paid the full penalty and attorneys fees 
the monitoring projects have  we believe  been completed and we have submitted our documentation to the state of texas for their approval 
we do not expect to incur any further costs of significance relating to this matter 
on april   there was a release of hydrocarbons followed by a significant fire in the ethylene refrigeration area of our base chemicals light olefins unit located in port arthur  texas 
see note casualty losses and insurance recoveries port arthur  texas  plant fire to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
there were no fatalities or serious injuries from the fire 
an incident investigation team was formed immediately 
the cause of the fire was determined to be a sudden rupture of a straight run of pipe which had been weakened by undetected external corrosion under insulation 
the texas commission on environmental quality the tceq has proposed  and we have accepted  a penalty of approximately million for alleged excessive environmental releases occurring as a consequence of the fire 
the settlement is awaiting approval of the tceq 
in may  our operation in wilton  uk  allegedly caused a discharge of wastewater effluent to be made to northumbrian water s bran sands treatment facility that contained elevated levels of nitrobenzene 
northumbrian water alleges that this discharge caused a disruption of its treatment facility which  in turn  exceeded its discharge consent from the uk environment agency 
the environmental agency is investigating a possible prosecution against northumbrian water and or us for the breach 
northumbrian water has threatened to prosecute our subsidiary in the uk to date  however  no charges have been filed 
asbestos litigation we have been named as a premises defendant in a number of asbestos exposure cases  typically claims by non employees of exposure to asbestos while at a facility 
in the past  these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants  and the complaints have not indicated which plaintiffs were making claims against which defendants  where or how the alleged injuries occurred  or what injuries each plaintiff claimed 
these facts  which would be central to any estimate of probable loss  generally have been learned only through discovery 
recent changes in texas tort procedures have required many pending cases to be split into multiple cases  one for each claimant  increasing the number of pending cases reported below 
while the complaints in these cases provide little additional information  we do not believe that the increased number of cases resulting from the changes in texas tort procedure reflects an increase in the number of underlying claims 
where the alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership of the relevant premises  the prior owners generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for  and to indemnify us against  asbestos exposure claims 
this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations 
upon service of a complaint in one of these cases  we tender it to the prior owner 
none of the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought 
the prior owner accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any amounts due to the claimants 
in our twelve year experience with tendering these cases  we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases 
we believe that the prior owners have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnity obligations  although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these cases if they do not 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about cases for which service has been received that we have tendered to the prior owner  all of which have been accepted 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  unresolved at beginning of period  tendered during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period   although the indemnifying party informs us when tendered cases have been resolved  it generally does not inform us of the settlement amounts relating to such cases  if any 
the indemnifying party has informed us that it typically manages our defense together with the defense of other entities in such cases and resolves claims involving multiple defendants simultaneously  and that it considers the allocation of settlement amounts  if any  among defendants to be confidential and proprietary 
consequently  we are not able to provide the number of cases resolved with payment by the indemnifying party or the amount of such payments 
we have never made any payments with respect to these cases 
as of december   we had an accrued liability of million relating to these cases and a corresponding receivable of million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our accruals 
additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future  and such claims could be material 
however  because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses associated with such claims  we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december  certain cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about these cases 
cases include all cases for which service has been received by us  other than a number of cases that were erroneously filed against us due to a clerical error 
the cases filed in error have been dismissed 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  unresolved at beginning of period filed during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period we paid gross settlement costs for asbestos exposure cases that are not subject to indemnification of million  nil and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cases for the year ended december  include cases filed against rubicon llc  which became our consolidated subsidiary on january   as follows one case filed during the period  one case resolved during the period and six cases unresolved at the end of the period 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our accruals 
additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future  and such claims could be material 
however  because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses associated with such claims  we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december  antitrust matters we have been named as a defendant in civil antitrust suits alleging a conspiracy to fix prices in the mdi  tdi  and polyether polyols industries that are now consolidated as the polyether polyols cases in multidistrict litigation known as in re urethane antitrust litigation  mdl no 
 civil no 
md jwl djw  united states district court  district of kansas  initial order transferring and consolidating cases filed august  other defendants named in the polyether polyols cases are bayer  basf  dow and lyondell 
these cases purport to be brought on behalf of a nationwide class of purchasers of mdi  tdi and polyether polyols 
bayer entered into a classwide settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that was approved by the court 
class certification briefing is underway in these consolidated cases 
we have also been named as a defendant in putative class action antitrust suits alleging a conspiracy to fix prices in the mdi  tdi and polyether polyols industries filed in the superior court of justice  ontario  canada on may  and in superior court  quebec  canada on may  the other defendants named above in the polyether polyols cases are also defendants in these canadian cases 
we also have been named as a defendant in a putative class action antitrust suit pending in california state court that alleges a conspiracy to fix prices of certain rubber and urethane products in california 
the other defendants named in the polyether polyols cases are also defendants in this case 
the california action has been stayed pending disposition of the polyether polyols cases 
the pleadings of the plaintiffs in these antitrust suits provide few specifics about any alleged illegal conduct of the defendants  and we are not aware of any evidence of illegal conduct by us or any of our employees 
for these reasons  we cannot estimate the possibility of loss or range of loss relating to these claims  and therefore we have not accrued a liability for these claims 
nevertheless  we could incur losses due to these claims in the future and those losses could be material 
in addition  by letter dated december   the antitrust division of the us department of justice informed us that it had terminated the previously disclosed grand jury investigation of possible antitrust violations by manufacturers of tdi  mdi and polyether polyols 
mtbe litigation in march  we were named for the first time as a defendant in eight lawsuits alleging liability related to mtbe contamination in groundwater 
we learned that we were named in a ninth such lawsuit in january numerous other companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in these and many other cases currently pending in us courts 
the plaintiffs in the cases in which we have been named are municipal water districts and a regional water supply authority that claim that defendants conduct has caused mtbe contamination of their groundwater

our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations  which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  including those in the adhesives  aerospace  automotive  construction products  durable and non durable consumer products  electronics  medical  packaging  paints and coatings  power generation  refining  synthetic fiber  textile chemicals and dye industries 
we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines  including mdi  amines  surfactants  epoxy based polymer formulations  textile chemicals  dyes  maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide 
our administrative  research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in item properties above  which are located in countries 
as of december   we employed approximately  associates worldwide 
our business was organized around our six segments polyurethanes  materials and effects  performance products  pigments  polymers and base chemicals 
our polyurethanes  materials and effects and performance products segments produce differentiated chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products 
our polymers and base chemicals segments produced commodity chemical products prior to the dispositions discussed in item business general above 
growth in our polyurethanes and materials and effects segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications  as well as by the level of global economic activity 
historically  demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth 
in polyurethanes  this growth  particularly in asia  has recently resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products  including mdi 
in our performance products segment  demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp as overall demand is significantly influenced by new product and application development 
overall demand for most of our performance intermediates has generally been stable or improving  but excess surfactant manufacturing capacity and a decline in the use of lab in new detergent formulations have continued to keep margins under pressure 
ethylene glycol industry operating rates and profitability declined from through due to additional capacity coming on stream but rebounded in over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical 
historically  demand for titanium dioxide pigments has grown at rates approximately equal to global gdp growth 
pigment prices have historically reflected industry wide operating rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers  contract arrangements and seasonality 
the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints  the largest end use for titanium dioxide  generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 
this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year 
during  we completed the us petrochemicals disposition pursuant to which we sold our north american polymers business and our us base chemicals business

we believe that ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance and our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income  cash flow from operations or other measures of performance as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
moreover  ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
our management uses ebitda to assess financial performance and debt service capabilities 
in assessing financial performance  our management reviews ebitda as a general indicator of economic performance compared to prior periods 
because ebitda excludes interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings  fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates  or levels of depreciation and amortization 
accordingly  our management believes this type of measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period and making certain related management decisions 
ebitda is also used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry 
for example  interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure  debt levels and credit ratings 
therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies 
in addition  the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result  effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies 
finally  companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets 
this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 
our management also believes that our investors use ebitda as a measure of our ability to service indebtedness as well as to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
nevertheless  our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income  which reflects overall financial performance  including the effects of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
ebitda also excludes taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
finally  ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda by using it to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than gaap results alone 
our management also uses other metrics to evaluate capital structure  tax planning and capital investment decisions 
for example  our management uses credit ratings and net debt ratios to evaluate capital structure  effective tax rate by jurisdiction to evaluate tax planning  and payback period and internal rate of return to evaluate capital investments 
our management also uses trade working capital to evaluate its investment in accounts receivable and inventory  net of accounts payable 
we believe that net income loss is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and that cash provided by operating activities is the liquidity measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda 
for each of our company and huntsman international  the following tables reconcile ebitda to net loss income and to net cash provided by operations dollars in millions huntsman corporation percent change year ended december  vs vs ebitda  depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income tax benefit from continuing operations income tax benefit expense from discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle nm net loss income nm nm cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle  net of tax nm nm extraordinary loss gain on the acquisition of a business  net of tax nm nm equity in income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of businesses assets  net noncash restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs loss on early extinguishment of debt noncash interest deferred income taxes nm net unrealized gain loss on foreign currency transactions nm other  net nm changes in operating assets and liabilites nm nm net cash used in provided by operating activities nm huntsman international percent change year ended december  vs vs ebitda   depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income tax expense benefit from continuing operations nm income tax benefit expense from discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle nm net loss income nm cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle  net of tax nm nm extraordinary loss gain on the acquisition of a business  net of tax nm nm equity in income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of businesses assets  net noncash restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs loss on early extinguishment of debt noncash interest deferred income taxes net unrealized gain loss on foreign currency transactions nm other  net changes in operating assets and liabilites nm net cash provided by operating activities nm not meaningful year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million on revenues of  million  compared with net income of million on revenues of  million for for the year ended december   huntsman international had a net loss of million on revenues of  million compared with net income of million on revenues of  million for the decrease of million in our net income and the decrease of million in huntsman international s net income was the result of the following items revenues for the year ended december  increased by million as compared with due principally to the effects of the textile effects acquisition on june   and to higher sales volumes in our polyurethanes  performance products and pigments segments and higher average selling prices in our polyurethanes  materials and effects and performance products segments

port arthur  texas plant fire on april   our port arthur  texas olefins manufacturing plant experienced a major fire 
with the exception of cyclohexane operations at the site  which were restarted in june  the remaining operations at the site were shutdown until we restarted operations in the fourth quarter of the port arthur manufacturing plant is covered by property damage and business interruption insurance 
with respect to coverage for this outage  the deductible for property damage is million and business interruption coverage does not apply for the first days  subject to a combined deductible for property damage and business interruption of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we received insurance recovery advances of million  of which million was applied to our insurance receivable related to recovery of costs already incurred and million was recorded as deferred insurance recovery gain in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  
during  we received additional recovery advances of million  totaling million of recovery advances through december  in addition  in december  reinsurers agreed to pay an additional million in recovery advances all of which was received by mid february  the reinsurers have failed to process additional requests for interim claim recovery advances pending their further review and adjusting of the overall claim

reimbursement of basell termination fee prior to entering into the merger agreement  we terminated the basell agreement and paid basell a million termination fee required under the terms of the basell agreement 
one half of the basell termination fee  or million  was funded by hexion 
we could be required to pay hexion the reimbursement amount under certain circumstances in connection with our termination of the merger agreement 
the million funded by hexion has been deferred and is recorded in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long term supply agreements 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists  risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables  which relate primarily to the licensing of technology  are evaluated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue and presented on a net basis in cost of goods sold 
long lived assets the determination of useful lives of our property  plant and equipment is considered a critical accounting estimate 
such lives are estimated based upon our historical experience  engineering estimates and industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets 
the estimated lives of our property range from to years and depreciation is recorded on the straight line method 
inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed 
without on going capital improvements and maintenance  the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter 
management uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets 
if the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment as of december  were to have been estimated to be one year greater or one year less  then depreciation expense for the year ended december  would have been approximately million less or million greater  respectively 
we are required to evaluate our plant assets whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management s plans change regarding those assets  such as idling or closing a plant 
we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups to the carrying value 
key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life  technology  competitive pressures  raw material pricing and regulations 
restructuring and plant closing costs we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations  work force reductions and other cost savings programs 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with the textile effects acquisition  we recorded liabilities for workforce reduction  non cancelable lease termination costs and demolition  decommissioning and other restructuring costs 
estimates for plant closing costs may include the write off of the carrying value of the plant and any necessary environmental and or regulatory costs 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
while management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate  management s estimates on a project by project basis have not varied to a material degree 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
subsequent to acquiring huntsman advanced materials in june and through december   substantially all non us operations of huntsman advanced materials were treated as our branches for us income tax purposes and were  therefore  subject to both us and non us income tax 
effective january   huntsman advanced materials foreign operations are no longer being treated as our branches and are not subject to us taxation on their earnings until those earnings are repatriated to the us  similar to our other non us entities 
for non us entities that are not treated as branches for non us tax purposes  we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax laws  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires us to make many assumptions and judgments regarding merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not we are required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
employee benefit programs we sponsor several contributory and non contributory defined benefit plans  covering employees primarily in the us  the us  the netherlands  belgium and canada  but also covering employees in a number of other countries 
we fund the material plans through trust arrangements or local equivalents where the assets are held separately from us 
we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the us and canada 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries 
inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected return on assets  discount rates  compensation increases  mortality rates and health care costs trends 
these assumptions are disclosed in note employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
management  with the advice of its actuaries  uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase decrease rate of compensation increase increase decrease estimated impact on net periodic benefit cost estimated impact on december  accumulated other comprehensive income loss stock based compensation plans management uses judgment in determining assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of its stock based compensation plans 
because we did not have stock based compensation plans prior to our initial public offering of common stock in february  our ability to use historical experience for assumptions related to stock based compensation plans has been limited 
the effect of a change in two key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact expected volatility increase decrease expected life of stock options granted during the period increase decrease estimated impact on compensation expense estimated impact on december  additional paid in capital environmental reserves environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation  available technology  site specific information and remediation alternatives 
we accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information 
adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  such as changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks 
from time to time  we enter into transactions  including transactions involving derivative instruments  to manage certain of these exposures 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  to the extent effective  and will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
we perform effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting at each reporting period 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations 
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
interest rate hedging through our borrowing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio  including the duration of the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates 
actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities  as well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments 
from time to time  we may purchase interest rate swaps and or interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate long term debt 
under interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties major banks the amounts  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings exceed a certain rate  and require us to pay to the counterparties major banks the amount  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings are less than a certain rate 
interest rate contracts are recorded as a component of other non current liabilities as of december  and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  with any ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
as of december  and  we had entered into various types of interest rate contracts to manage our interest rate risk on our long term debt as indicated below dollars in millions notional amount fair value cash flow hedges non designated derivatives maturity for the year ended december  and  the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss income associated with cash flow hedging activities is indicated below balance at january current period change in fair value reclassifications to earnings balance at december on july   an interest rate contract with a notional amount of million pursuant to which we had swapped libor interest for a fixed rate of matured 
during the next twelve months ending december   interest expense of approximately nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings 
the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative financial instruments 
we anticipate  however  that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy obligations under the contracts 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange rates our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
our revenues and expenses are denominated in various global currencies 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short term impact of movements in foreign currency rates 
where practicable  we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts generally with maturities of one year or less 
we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings 
as of and for the years ended december  and  the fair value and unrealized gains losses of outstanding foreign currency rate hedging contracts were not significant 
our a r securitization program in certain circumstances requires that we enter into forward foreign currency hedges intended to hedge currency exposures 
as of december  and  we had no forward currency hedges outstanding under our a r securitization program 
in conjunction with the redemption of our remaining euro denominated subordinated notes due in the first quarter of discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources debt and liquidity subordinated notes  and in an effort to maintain approximately the same amount of euro denominated debt exposure  on march   we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we have agreed to swap million of libor floating rate debt payments for million of euribor floating rate debt payments 
on maturity  august   we are required to pay principal of million and we will receive principal of million 
during the life of this swap  we will receive floating rate interest libor in dollars and we will pay floating rate interest euribor in euros 
this swap is currently not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
as of december   the fair value of this swap was an unrealized loss of million and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recorded an unrealized foreign currency loss on this swap of million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in conjunction with an amendment to our senior credit facilities discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources cash for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and in an effort to maintain approximately the same amount of euro denominated debt exposure  on april   we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we have agreed to swap million of libor floating rate debt payments for million of euribor floating rate debt payments 
on maturity  april   we are required to pay principal of million and we will receive principal of million 
during the life of this swap  we will receive floating rate interest libor in dollars and we will pay floating rate interest euribor in euros 
this swap was designated as a hedge of a net investment for financial reporting purposes 
as of december   the fair value of this swap was an unrealized loss of million and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recorded an unrealized foreign currency loss on this swap of million in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  on july   we unwound a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we had swapped million of fixed rate debt for million of fixed rate debt 
the swap was not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
we recorded an unrealized foreign currency loss on this swap of million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  a significant portion of our debt is denominated in euros 
we also finance certain of our non us subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are  in many cases  denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currency 
we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means  including cross currency swaps  the designation of certain intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future permanent loans and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income 
from time to time  we review such designation of intercompany loans 
from time to time  we review our non us dollar denominated debt and swaps to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges 
as of december   we have designated approximately million of euro denominated debt and swaps as hedges of our net investments 
as of december   we had approximately  million in net euro assets 
on january   we entered into a series of forward foreign currency contracts in our pigments segment to partially hedge the impact  for up to one year  of movements in foreign currency rates associated with the purchases of raw materials and sales of pigment in non functional currencies 
these contracts have a notional amount of approximately million 
commodity prices our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices  and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice 
consequently  we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures
