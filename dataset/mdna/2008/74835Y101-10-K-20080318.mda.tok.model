item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiary 
overview we currently own two commercial products  hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection and doral quazepam 
hp acthar gel acthar is an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis ms 
in addition  acthar is not indicated for  but is used in treating patients with infantile spasms is  a rare form of refractory childhood epilepsy  and opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  a rare autoimmune related childhood neurological disorder 
doral is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
we are also developing new medications  including qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
in may  we determined that our sales force driven business strategy was not generating an appropriate return and took action to terminate that strategy 
we began the process of examining different strategies to best position acthar to benefit patients  advance our product development programs  and preserve our capital 
as part of this process  we reduced the number of members of our field organization by approximately  announced the departure of our former chief executive officer  and appointed don bailey  a member of our board of directors  our interim president 
mr 
bailey was subsequently appointed president and chief executive officer in november in august  we announced a new strategy and business model for acthar 
in connection with the new strategy  we implemented a new pricing level for acthar which was effective august  we also expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and established a group of product service consultants and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
the new acthar strategy  as demonstrated by our results  has significantly improved our ability to maintain the long term availability of acthar and fund important research and development projects 
our total net sales were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  our net income before income taxes and the allocation of earnings to preferred stock was million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million as of december  acthar is currently approved in the us for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms and many other conditions with an inflammatory component 
no drug is currently approved in the us for the treatment of is  a potentially life threatening disorder that typically begins in the first year of life 
however  pursuant to guidelines published by the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  many child neurologists use acthar to treat infants afflicted with is even though it is not approved for this indication 
in june  we submitted a supplemental new drug application snda to the us food and drug administration fda and are currently pursuing formal agency approval of an indication for the use of acthar in the treatment of is 
in may  
table of contents we received an action letter from the fda indicating that our snda was not approvable in its current form 
in november  we met with the fda to further discuss our snda 
at the meeting  the fda concurred with our suggested pathway to preparing a complete application for fda review  which will involve submission of additional information to the fda 
we are gathering this additional information in preparation for our intended submission to the fda 
our goal is to submit the additional information by the end of at this time  the fda is not requiring us to conduct a clinical trial to support our resubmission 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we will also qualify for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar 
in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet odt formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
qsc is being formulated by eurand and would utilize eurand s proprietary microcaps taste masking and advatab tm odt technologies 
we own the world wide rights to commercialize qsc and eurand would exclusively supply the product and receive a royalty on product sales 
for the subset of individuals who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc could represent a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
our goal is to enter pivotal trials during with qsc since august  we have been heavily focused on executing our newly adopted strategy and business model for acthar 
while we will continue to focus on maximizing the benefits of the new acthar strategy  we have recently begun a process to identify our long term business growth strategy 
any such strategy will likely involve pharmaceutical products  but no specific potential business growth strategies have yet been presented to our board of directors 
during february  we used part of our generated free cash flow to repurchase of all of our remaining preferred stock 
on february   we completed the repurchase of the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock from shire pharmaceuticals  inc for cash consideration of million or per share the same price per preferred share as the closing price per share of our common stock on february  
the existence of the series a preferred stock created a complex capital structure that limited our flexibility in developing a long term strategy and required us to take into consideration the interest of the preferred stockholder 
for example  among other rights associated with the series a preferred stock  the series a preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock  had a million liquidation preference  and required us to obtain the holder s separate approval in the event of a merger transaction 
we announced on march   that our board of directors also approved a stock repurchase plan that provides for our repurchase of up to million of our common shares in either open market or private transactions  which will occur from time to time and in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
through march   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million 
we have registered trademarks on hp acthar gel and doral 
each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
we believe our trademarks  trade names and service marks have value and play an important role in our business efforts

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 
hp acthar gel hp acthar gel is a natural source  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth  which we acquired in july acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
it works by stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete the natural endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
acthar was approved by the fda in and is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the 
table of contents treatment of periodic flares associated with ms  infantile spasm is  opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  and various forms of arthritis collectively called joint pain 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience painful  episodic flares 
we promote acthar for the treatment of exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is the most common treatment of choice for this indication  but acthar continues to be used in some patients who do not respond adequately to intravenous methylprednisolone or who cannot tolerate intravenous methylprednisolone 
although the fda approved package labeling does not mention is as an fda approved indication  acthar has historically been used to treat this condition 
no drug is currently approved in the us for the treatment of is 
based on the document entitled practice parameter medical treatment of infantile spasms  a report of the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
in august  the fda accepted for review our snda seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of is 
in may  we received an action letter from the fda indicating that our snda was not approvable in its current form 
in november  we met with the fda to further discuss our snda 
at the meeting  the fda concurred with our suggested pathway to preparing a complete application for fda review  which will involve submission of additional information to the fda 
we are gathering this additional information in preparation for our intended submission to the fda 
our goal is to submit the additional information by the end of at this time  the fda is not requiring us to conduct a clinical trial to support our resubmission 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we will also qualify for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasm generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while about one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the availability of acthar in the several years before our acquisition of the drug in from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  now csl behring was very restricted  so that many physicians used synthetic steroids and other unapproved products to treat is 
the market for is therapies has since been stable for many years  and acthar remains the treatment of choice among physicians 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteroids  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of is and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
solu medrol is the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms flares 
see section below titled competition and item a risk factors risks associated with our business if competitors develop and market products that are similar to ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated for a discussion of additional risks related to competition 
in addition to being indicated for the treatment of exacerbations of ms  acthar has over fifty other labeled indications and uses in certain endocrine disorders  rheumatic disorders  collagen diseases  allergic states  ophthalmic diseases  respiratory diseases  hematologic disorders  neoplastic diseases  edematous states  and gastrointestinal diseases 
for the years ended december   and  net product sales of acthar were million  million and million  respectively 
doral in may  we purchased the rights in the united states to doral from medpointe pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement agreement 
doral is a commercial product indicated for the treatment of insomnia  
table of contents characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
sleep disturbance and insomnia is a very common side effect of many diseases and disorders 
the overall us market for sleep medicines has seen significant growth over the past several years and is estimated to have generated over billion in prescription drug sales in we believe that doral has a number of unique properties that make it an attractive option for the many patients who suffer from sleep disturbance 
we made a million cash payment on the transaction closing date and a second cash payment of million related to the fda s approval of an alternative source to manufacture and supply the active ingredient quazepam for doral 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we acquired all finished goods inventories of doral existing at the closing date and assumed an obligation to pay a royalty to ivax research  inc ivax on net sales of doral 
in january  we made a cash payment of  to ivax to eliminate the royalty obligation 
we entered into a separate supply agreement with medpointe to supply doral for an initial term of three years 
the supply agreement may be extended for an additional term of three years upon the written consent of both parties prior to the end of the initial term 
we accounted for the doral product acquisition as an asset purchase and allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired 
we attributed million  which included acquisition costs of  and the  payment to eliminate the royalty obligation  to purchased technology and  to inventory 
purchased technology is being amortized on a straight line basis over fifteen years  the expected life of the doral product rights 
net product sales of doral were million and  for the year ended december  and the period may through december  respectively 
product development in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet odt formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen hb apap for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
qsc is being formulated by eurand and would utilize eurand s proprietary microcaps taste masking and advatab tm odt technologies 
we own the world wide rights to commercialize qsc and eurand would exclusively supply the product and receive a royalty on product sales 
hb apap  in its variety of strengths  is one of the most frequently prescribed products in the us with over million prescriptions written in according to a third party provider of prescription data 
there are currently no odt formulations of hb apap available in the united states 
for the many individuals who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc represents a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
our goal is to enter pivotal trials during with qsc eurand would receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development milestones 
we currently estimate that we will not make any milestone payments to eurand in advatab tm can be combined with eurand s microcaps taste masking technology to provide an odt with a pleasant taste 
in addition  advatab tm tablets dissolve rapidly in the mouth within to seconds  and the smooth mixture of carrier excipients and taste masked drug granules is suitable for delivering high drug doses 
modified release drug granules can also be incorporated into the advatab tm dosage form to provide a fast dissolve tablet with sustained release properties 
advatab tm tablets can be packaged in either bottles or blisters 
eurand is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and commercializes enhanced pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products based on its proprietary drug formulation technologies 
since  eurand has had four products approved by the fda  three resulting from co development partnerships 
eurand has a pipeline of products in development both for its co development partners and its proprietary portfolio 
eurand s technology platforms include bioavailability enhancement of poorly soluble drugs  customized release  taste masking fast dissolving formulations  and drug conjugation 
eurand has manufacturing and research facilities in the us  italy and france 
we also own other non core technology  much of which we have licensed to others for further development and commercialization 
we have licensed our antiviral drug discovery program to rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel 
we may receive milestone payments or royalties should rigel progress development and ultimately commercialize products using the licensed technology 
however  to date  we have not received any milestone or royalty payments and there can be no assurance that we will receive any such payments in the future 

table of contents our research and development expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
manufacturing our products are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
acthar has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
this transfer was approved by the fda in january our agreement with cbl extends through in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which terminates on december  and includes a one year extension option 
while we have received approval for the acthar finished vials and api transfers to new contract manufacturers  the processes used to manufacture and test acthar are complex and subject to fda inspection and approval 
we have selected a contract laboratory to perform two bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
these bioassays have been successfully transferred from aventis now csl behring to the contract laboratory  and were approved by the fda in june csl behring continues to conduct potency testing for release of api and finished vials and in february  we extended our agreement with csl behring through the transfer of manufacturing of acthar from aventis to our new contract manufacturers is resulting in higher unit costs than the fixed price manufacturing agreement with aventis 
doral has a shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
we entered into a separate supply agreement with medpointe for doral with an initial term of three years 
our agreement with medpointe calls for medpointe to procure the raw materials and manufacture and package doral 
the supply agreement may be extended for an additional term of three years upon the written consent of both parties prior to the end of the initial term 
the api used in doral is procured by medpointe from a third party supplier 
a new manufacturer of the api was approved by the fda in november there can be no assurance that any of our api or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness 
also  there can be no assurance our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all of the fda s current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of api or our finished products  or for the manufacture of products that we may acquire or develop  may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
divested product lines on october  we sold our non core pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  ethamolin and glofil nascobal is a prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin is an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and glofil is an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function 
our net product sales of the divested product lines were million for the year ended december  effective october   our results of operations and cash flows excluded the net product sales and direct operating costs and expenses of the divested product lines 
because the divested product lines were part of a larger cash flow generating group and did not represent a separate operation  the divested product lines were not reported as discontinued operations 
in june  we divested our non core development stage product emitasol nasal metoclopramide which resulted in net proceeds of  
table of contents under the terms of the agreement  we may receive a royalty on product sales of emitasol as well as future payments based on the achievement of certain clinical and commercial goals 
sales and marketing acthar is approved for sale in the us and we have the us rights to doral 
we do not have substantial operations outside the us however  we have agreements with the following companies to market and distribute acthar on a named patient basis in certain other countries 
beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
we have an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
beacon of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
gross sales to beacon were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
idis limited we have an agreement with idis limited idis of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia and new zealand  and the uk  where acthar is sold through beacon 
gross sales to idis were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with our products 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition and commercialization of products 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that we may develop  should they be approved  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
certain potentially competitive products to acthar are in various stages of development  some of which have been filed for approval with the fda or have been approved by regulatory authorities in other countries 
vigabatrin is a potentially competitive product that is currently approved for use in canada and is under review in the united states by the fda for the treatment of infantile spasms 
two additional potentially competitive drugs to acthar that we are currently monitoring are synacthen and ganaxolone 
synacthen has been approved in the european union for use in treating exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our business if competitors develop and market products that are similar to ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated for a discussion of additional risks related to competition 

table of contents government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products all pharmaceutical operations associated with the production  testing  packaging and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 
in september  the us president signed the food and drug administration amendments act of  or fdaaa 
the new legislation grants significant new powers to the fda  many of which are aimed at improving the safety of drug products before and after approval 
in particular  the new law authorizes the fda to  among other things  require post approval studies and clinical trials  mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information  and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs  including certain currently approved drugs 
in addition  it significantly expands the federal government s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products 
under the fdaaa  companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties 
although we expect these and other provisions of the fdaaa to have a substantial effect on the pharmaceutical industry  the extent of that effect is not yet known 
as the fda issues regulations  guidance and interpretations relating to the new legislation  the impact on the industry  as well as our business  will become clearer 
the new requirements and other changes that the fdaaa imposes may make it more difficult  and likely more costly  to obtain approval of new pharmaceutical products and to produce  market and distribute existing products 
drug products must be manufactured  tested  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt any pharmaceutical operations that are not in compliance with cgmps 
the fda may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
in march we received a drug class action letter from the fda requesting modifications to labeling and creation of a medication guide for sedative hypnotic drug products that are indicated for the treatment of insomnia  including our product doral 
we have revised doral s labeling and created a medication guide  both of which have been approved by the fda 
in february we began shipping doral product with the revised labeling and new medication guide 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our business we cannot provide assurances that we will remain in compliance with all regulatory requirements for a discussion of risks related to government regulation of marketed pharmaceutical products 
drugs in development products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act  and if applicable by foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous pre clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us and current or potential development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining 
table of contents these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
product liability insurance the clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims  against which we maintain liability insurance 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our business if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products for a discussion of certain risks related to product liability claims that may be made against us 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have a patent on acthar or doral 
however  we do have us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our business if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues for a discussion of additional risks related to intellectual property rights 
employees as of december  and we had and full time employees  respectively 
in may  we determined that our sales force driven business strategy was not generating an appropriate return and took action to terminate that strategy 
we began the process of examining different strategies to best position acthar to benefit patients  advance our product development programs  and preserve our capital 
as part of this process  we reduced the number of members of the our field organization by approximately  announced the departure of our former chief executive officer  and appointed don bailey  a member of the our board of directors  as our interim president 
mr 
bailey was subsequently appointed president and chief executive officer in november the reduction of the field organization was completed on may  our one time expense was comprised of  for severance benefits and  for other associated costs 
the one time expense is included in selling  general  and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we estimate that this reduction eliminated between million and million of annualized cash expenses associated with the field organization 
in august  we announced a new strategy and business model for acthar 
in connection with the new strategy  we implemented a new pricing level for acthar which was effective august  we also expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net 
table of contents for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and established a group of product service consultants and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
the new acthar strategy  as demonstrated by our results  has significantly improved our ability to maintain the long term availability of acthar and fund important research and development projects 
our continued success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

risk factors risks associated with the implementation of our new strategy and business model for acthar summary overview the implementation of our new strategy and business model for acthar creates risks and uncertainties  including risks associated with the possibility of declining unit sales  the refusal of third party payors to provide reimbursement for purchases of acthar  a greater proportion of our acthar unit sales being comprised of product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients and government entities where we do not expect to recognize any net sales  and that the actual amount of rebates and discounts on acthar dispensed to medicaid eligible patients and government entities may differ materially from our estimates 
we could also receive negative publicity as a result of our adoption of this new strategy  and responding from inquiries from the press or patient advocacy groups  or dealing with litigation against us  could divert the attention of key employees from operating our business 
many of these risks are further described below 
we may be negatively affected by lower reimbursement levels 
our ability to generate revenues is affected by the availability of reimbursement for acthar and our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for acthar from third party payors 
the sale of acthar will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and private insurance plans 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs  including acthar 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of acthar  which may also impact acthar s sales 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for acthar may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for acthar may reduce the demand for  or the price of  acthar  which could result in lower acthar sales  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 

table of contents regulatory changes could negatively affect the implementation of our new strategy 
in the united states  proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such changes enacted may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
the medicare prescription drug improvement  and modernization act  enacted in december  provides for  among other things  an immediate reduction in the medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs administered in a physician s office 
the medicare act  as well as other changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for acthar  may reduce or eliminate reimbursement for acthar 
in addition  if the medicare act was amended  or other regulations were adopted  to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions  it would have a significant adverse impact on our business 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in several states and local metropolitan areas 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to innovative medicines  the market acceptance of these products may be reduced 
we are unable to predict what impact the medicare act or other future legislation  if any  relating to third party reimbursement  will have on acthar s sales 
we are in the process of identifying a long term strategy 
since august  we have been heavily focused on executing our newly adopted strategy and business model for acthar 
while we will continue to focus on maximizing the benefits of the new acthar strategy  we have recently begun a process to identify our long term business growth strategy 
any such strategy will likely involve pharmaceutical products  but no specific potential business growth strategies have yet been presented to our board of directors 
accordingly  there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the business growth strategy which we may ultimately adopt 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in each contemplated business growth strategy  we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors 
risks associated with our business we have a history of operating losses and have only recently generated sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we have a history of recurring operating losses  and our accumulated deficit through december  was million 
we recognized net income applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december   however  this was primarily attributable to our implementation of our new strategy and business model for acthar during the year  and there can be no assurance that this new strategy and business model will result in continued profitability 
for the year ended december   sales of acthar represented of our total net sales 
we expect to continue to rely on this product for substantially all of our product sales for the foreseeable future 
we cannot predict whether the demand for acthar will continue in the future or that we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar 
if we are forced to reduce the price for acthar  the demand for acthar declines  if third party payors refuse to provide reimbursement for purchases of acthar  if we are forced to re negotiate contracts or terms  or if our customers do not comply with our existing policies  our revenues from the sale of acthar would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our revenues from the sale of acthar decline  our total revenues  gross margins and operating results would be harmed we may not be able to fully utilize for our benefit our cumulative net operating losses 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credits of  and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  and  and  of federal and california research and development credits  respectively  are available to reduce our taxable income 
we have established a valuation allowance of million for deferred tax assets related to million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards   of federal research and development credit carryforwards   of california research and development credit 
table of contents carryforwards  and other state temporary differences  as it was not considered more likely than not as of december  that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and the federal research and development credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after december  such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available as of december  before utilization 
we may experience acthar distribution problems as a result of the outsourcing of our acthar distribution functions to curascript 
during july we began utilizing curascript  a third party specialty distributor  to store and distribute acthar 
on august   we stopped selling acthar to wholesalers and we now rely on curascript for all of our proceeds from sales of acthar in the united states 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may experience difficulties that could reduce  delay or stop shipments of acthar 
if we encounter such distribution problems  acthar could become unavailable  resulting in either lost revenues or higher than anticipated acthar distribution costs 
if competitors develop and market products that are similar to ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
we cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of potentially competitive products or their possible effect on our sales 
certain potentially competitive products to acthar are in various stages of development  some of which have been filed for approval with the fda or have been approved by regulatory authorities in other countries 
vigabatrin is a potentially competitive product that is currently approved for use in canada and is under review in the united states by the fda for the treatment of infantile spasms 
the fda accepted for review the vigabatrin nda for use in the united states in february and assigned it a priority review 
should vigabatrin receive approval to be used in the united states  the result could be detrimental to acthar s sales 
prednisone and prednisolone are the generic names for anti inflammatory corticosteroid drugs that are used to treat various types of inflammation 
one off label use of these drugs has been to treat infantile spasms 
should more doctors prescribe prednisone or prednisolone to target the same diseases and conditions that acthar targets  the result could be detrimental to current acthar sales 
two additional potentially competitive drugs to acthar that we are currently monitoring are synacthen and ganaxolone 
synacthen has been approved in the european union for use in treating exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis 
we are not presently aware of any effort to attempt to gain fda approval for marketing synacthen in the us ganaxolone is currently undergoing a phase iib study for the treatment of infantile spasms  but is not currently approved in any jurisdiction 
both synacthen and ganaxolone could potentially compete with acthar in the future should they ever receive the necessary fda and regulatory approvals 
some of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 

table of contents if we are unable to contract with third party contract manufacturers  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our existing products  and will likely do the same for other products that we may develop  commercialize or acquire in the future 
contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our required products and services on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if any required approvals by the fda and other regulatory authorities do not occur on a timely basis  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose fda approval of our products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
the loss of our key management personnel could have an adverse impact on future operations 
we are highly dependent on the services of the principal members of our senior management team  and the loss of a member of senior management could create significant disruption in our ability to provide acthar to our customers 
we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  financial operations  business development  clinical development  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which may include extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that we develop  impose significant additional costs on us  diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and decrease our ability to generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or 
table of contents partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
we cannot predict whether the fda will approve our snda for acthar or for our other products in our development pipeline 
during the year ended december   the fda requested additional information for our supplemental new drug application seeking approval for acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms 
in addition  we continued our clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc there can be no assurance that our efforts to develop qsc or obtain approval of acthar for infantile spasm will be successful or will not be delayed due to regulatory or other factors 
we cannot provide assurances that we will remain in compliance with all regulatory requirements 
no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements for our currently marketed products or any new product once clearance or approval has been obtained 
these requirements include  among other things  regulations regarding manufacturing practices  product labeling and post marketing reporting  including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns 
additionally  the facilities and procedures of our suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation  including periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
a significant percentage of acthar prescriptions is for is  an indication which is not an approved indication for acthar 
while physicians may lawfully prescribe acthar for is and other off label uses  any promotion by us of off label uses would be unlawful 
some of our practices intended to respond to questions from physicians with respect to off label uses of acthar without engaging in off label promotion could nonetheless be construed as off label promotion 
although we have policies and procedures in place designed to help assure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements regarding off label promotion  some non compliant actions may nonetheless occur 
regulatory authorities could take enforcement action against us if they believe we are promoting  or have promoted  our products for off label use 
also  the label for acthar includes a list of indications for which acthar has not been actively promoted or prescribed for in several years  if ever 
it is possible that the fda could  in the context of reviewing our snda for is or otherwise  conduct a review of the acthar label and require us to provide data to the fda regarding the safety and efficacy of acthar relating to these indications 
if we are unable to provide satisfactory data  it is possible that the fda could require us to remove various indications from the label of approved uses of acthar 
we must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with complex regulations 
possible regulatory actions could include warning letters  fines  damages  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  seizures of our products and criminal prosecution 
these actions could result in  among other things  substantial modifications to our business practices and operations  refunds  recalls or a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of our suppliers facilities while our suppliers remedy the alleged violation  the inability to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market 
any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
our current pipeline of new products is limited and any products that we may acquire or develop may not be accepted by the market  which may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
any products that we successfully acquire or develop in the future  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully acquired or developed  may compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize the products that we may develop 

table of contents the degree of market acceptance of our commercial products and any products that we successfully acquire or develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance for any products that we successfully acquire or develop in the future  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
we do not have patents on our existing commercial products 
however  our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could have a negative market reaction 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to report on  and will require our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the initial deadline for us to become compliant with section was december  as of such date  we were compliant and have implemented an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to continue to comply with these requirements 
accordingly  we continue to incur expenses and will devote management resources to section compliance as necessary 
further  effective internal controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if our internal controls and procedures become ineffective  we may not be able to provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed and current and potential shareholders may not have confidence in our financial reporting 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and for those products we currently market 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to million 
however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility 
following the implementation of our new strategy and business model for acthar  our stock price appreciated significantly 
the closing price per share of our common stock ranged in value from to during the two year period ended december  any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
for example  our quarterly revenues or earnings or losses can fluctuate based on the buying patterns of our specialty distributor  specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
in the event that patient demand for acthar is less than our sales to our specialty distributor  excess acthar inventories may result at our specialty distributor  specialty pharmacies and hospitals  which may impact future acthar sales 
other potential events that could affect our stock price include  without limitation  our quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings or losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  our ability to obtain product from our contract manufacturers  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us 
we have significant stock option overhang which could dilute your investment 
we have a substantial overhang of common stock due to a low average exercise price of employee stock options 
the future exercise of employee stock options could cause substantial dilution  which may negatively affect the market price of our shares 

table of contents we may seek additional funding which would dilute your investment 
we may seek to raise capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
if revenues from product sales are less than we expect or if further capital resources are not available  or if such resources cannot be obtained on attractive terms to us  this may further limit our ability to fund operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  achieving better operating efficiencies  maintaining customer compliance with our policies  and obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers 
we may obtain additional financing through public or private debt or equity financings 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our shareholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to reduce our operations or to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our products or development programs 
if our officers  directors and largest shareholders choose to act together  they could exert significant influence over the outcome of a shareholder vote 
our officers  directors and holders of or more of our outstanding common stock may be deemed to beneficially own approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock as of december  as a result  these shareholders  acting together  would be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
the interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other shareholders  and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders 
the voting power of these shareholders includes the shares held by our five largest shareholders  paolo cavazza and his affiliates  tang capital partners and its affiliates  claudio cavazza and his affiliates  black horse capital and its affiliates  visium asset management and its affiliates  and broadwood partners  lp and its affiliates  which beneficially own approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock

overview we currently own two commercial products  hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection and doral quazepam 
hp acthar gel acthar is an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of exacerbations associated with multiple sclerosis ms 
in addition  acthar is not indicated for  but is used in treating patients with infantile spasms is  a rare form of refractory childhood epilepsy  and opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome  a rare autoimmune related childhood neurological disorder 
doral is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
we are also developing new medications  including qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
in may  we determined that our sales force driven business strategy was not generating an appropriate return and took action to terminate that strategy 
we began the process of examining different strategies to best position acthar to benefit patients  advance our product development programs  and preserve our capital 
as part of this process  we reduced the number of members of our field organization by approximately  announced the departure of our former chief executive officer  and appointed don bailey  a member of our board of directors  our interim president 
mr 
bailey was subsequently appointed president and chief executive officer in november in august  we announced a new strategy and business model for acthar 
in connection with the new strategy  we implemented a new pricing level for acthar which was effective august  we also expanded our sponsorship of acthar patient assistance and co pay assistance programs  which provide an important safety net for uninsured and under insured patients using acthar  and established a group of product service consultants and medical science liaisons to work with healthcare providers who administer acthar 
the new strategy  as demonstrated by our results  has significantly improved our ability to maintain the long term availability of acthar and fund important research and development projects 
our total net sales were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  our net income before income taxes and the allocation of earnings to preferred stock was million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million as of december  acthar is currently approved in the us for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms and many other conditions with an inflammatory component 
no drug is approved in the us for the treatment of is  a potentially life threatening disorder that typically begins in the first year of life 
however  pursuant to guidelines published by the american academy of neurology and the child neurology society  many child neurologists use acthar to treat infants afflicted with is 
in june  we submitted a supplemental new drug application snda to the us food and drug administration fda and are currently pursuing formal agency approval of an indication for the use of acthar in the treatment of is 
in may  we received an action letter from the fda indicating that our snda was not approvable in its current form 
in november  we met with the fda to further discuss our snda 
at the meeting  the fda concurred with our suggested pathway to preparing a complete application for fda review  which will involve submission of additional information to the fda 
we are gathering this additional 
table of contents information in preparation for our intended submission to the fda 
our goal is to submit the additional information by the end of at this time  the fda is not requiring us to conduct a clinical trial to support our resubmission 
previously  the fda granted orphan designation to acthar for the treatment of is 
as a result of this orphan designation  if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for the is indication  we will also qualify for a seven year exclusivity period during which the fda is prohibited from approving any other acth formulation for is unless the other formulation is demonstrated to be clinically superior to acthar 
in november  we initiated a clinical development program under our investigational new drug application with the fda for qsc  a unique orally disintegrating tablet odt formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients with swallowing difficulties 
qsc is being formulated by eurand and would utilize eurand s proprietary microcaps taste masking and advatab tm odt technologies 
we own the world wide rights to commercialize qsc and eurand would exclusively supply the product and receive a royalty on product sales 
for the subset of individuals who experience significant difficulty swallowing pills  we believe qsc could represent a valuable option for the treatment of their pain 
since august  we have been heavily focused on executing our newly adopted strategy and business model for acthar 
while we will continue to focus on maximizing the benefits of the new acthar strategy  we have recently begun a process to identify our long term business growth strategy 
any such strategy will likely involve pharmaceutical products  but no specific potential business growth strategies have yet been presented to our board of directors 
during february  we used part of our generated free cash flow to repurchase of all of our remaining preferred stock 
on february   we completed the repurchase of the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock from shire pharmaceuticals  inc for cash consideration of million or per share the same price per preferred share as the closing price per share of our common stock on february  
the existence of the series a preferred stock created a complex capital structure that limited our flexibility in developing a long term strategy and required us to take into consideration the interest of the preferred stockholder 
for example  among other rights associated with the series a preferred stock  the series a preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock  had a million liquidation preference  and required us to obtain the holder s separate approval in the event of a merger transaction 
we announced on march   that our board of directors also approved a stock repurchase plan that provides for our repurchase of up to million of our common shares in either open market or private transactions  which will occur from time to time and in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
through march   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million 
our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  demand for our products by patients  inventory levels of our products held by third parties  amount of medicaid rebates on our products dispensed to medicaid eligible patients  the amount of chargebacks on the sale of our products by our specialty distributor to government entities  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  and the timing and amount of our product development expenses 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our medicaid rebate obligation related to our products dispensed to medicaid eligible patients  chargebacks on sales of our products by wholesalers and our specialty distributor to government entities  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  share based compensation  lease termination liability and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
table of contents sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales reserves we have estimated reserves for product returns from our specialty distributor  wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies  government chargebacks for sales of our products by wholesalers and our specialty distributor to certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  medicaid rebates to all states for products dispensed to patients covered by medicaid  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for existing products and data obtained from external sources 
significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these sales reserves are the most reasonably likely assumptions considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates could differ significantly from our estimates because our analysis of product shipments  prescription trends  the amount of product in the distribution channel  and our interpretation of the medicaid statute and regulations  may not be accurate 
if actual product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates are significantly different from our estimates  or if our customers fail to adhere to our expired product returns policy  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
to date  actual amounts have been consistent with our estimates 
during july  we began utilizing curascript  a third party specialty distributor  to store and distribute acthar 
effective august   we no longer sell acthar to wholesalers and all of our proceeds from sales of acthar in the united states are received from curascript 
we sell acthar to curascript at a discount from our list price 
product sales are recognized net of this discount upon receipt of the product by curascript 
curascript has days from when product is received to pay us for their purchases of acthar 
we will supply replacement product to curascript on product returned between one month prior to expiration to three months post expiration 
returns from product lots will be exchanged for replacement product  and estimated costs for such exchanges  which include actual product material costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of product sales 
a reserve for estimated future replacements has been recorded as a liability which will be reduced as future replacements occur  with an offset to product inventories 
we establish a reserve for the sales value of expired product expected to be returned by wholesalers and their customers with a corresponding reduction in gross product sales 
the reserve is reduced as credit memoranda are issued  with an offset to accounts receivable 
in estimating the return rate for expired product returned by wholesalers and their customers  we primarily analyze historical returns by product  return merchandise authorizations  inventory on hand at wholesalers  and the remaining shelf life of that inventory 
we believe that the information obtained from wholesalers regarding inventory levels is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
we routinely assess our historical experience including customers compliance with our product return policy  and we adjust our reserves as appropriate 
subsequent to our transition of acthar distribution by wholesalers to specialty distribution by curascript  the reserve for the sales value of expired product expected to be returned by wholesalers and their customers relates to estimated returns associated with our sales of doral and our estimate of returns associated with sales of acthar to wholesalers prior to our transition to curascript 

table of contents at december  and  sales related reserves for product returns were as follows december  in s balance  beginning of year actual returns in current year related to sales from prior years actual returns in current year related to sales from current year current provision related to sales made in prior years current provision related to sales made in current year balance  end of year the decrease in the provision as of december  relates to the transition of acthar distribution from multiple wholesalers to our sole specialty distributor 
we provide credit to wholesalers and their customers and will provide replacement product to our specialty distributor 
as of december   million of the returns reserve related to the final product lots of acthar shipped to wholesalers under our credit memorandum policy with product expiration dates in as required by federal regulations  we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients 
our estimated historical rebate percentage is used to estimate the rebate units for the period 
we then apply a rebate amount per unit to the estimated rebate units to arrive at the estimated reserve for the period 
the estimated total rebate units are comprised of the estimated rebate units associated with estimated end user demand during the period and the estimated rebate units associated with estimated inventory in the distribution channel as of the end of the period 
the medicaid rebates associated with end user demand for a period are paid to the states by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the rebate estimated reserve is established 
the rebate amount per unit is determined based on a formula established by statute and is subject to review and modification by the administrators of the medicaid program 
the rebate per unit formula is comprised of a basic rebate of applied to the average per unit amount of payments we receive on our product sales and an additional per unit rebate that is based on our current sales price compared to our sales price on an inflation adjusted basis from a designated base period 
our acthar rebate amount per unit was approximately of our price to our specialty distributor through august  and increased to of our price to our specialty distributor during the fourth quarter ended december  however  effective january   as a result of the impact of the additional per unit rebate component of the rebate per unit formula  we estimate that our rebate amount per unit will be approximately  higher than our price to our specialty distributor for each acthar vial dispensed to a medicaid eligible patient 
in connection with the implementation of our new pricing strategy for acthar  coupled with recent clarifications of the statute in july by program administrators  we initiated an extensive review of the medicaid statute and regulations 
after such review and consultation with our regulatory legal counsel  we prospectively modified how we determine our rebate amount per unit to conform with the statute 
the modification was implemented in august and communicated to the program administrators in september the modification increased net sales and net income applicable to common shareholders by million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this sales and income benefit ended during the fourth quarter of certain government entities are permitted to purchase our products for a nominal amount from wholesalers and our specialty distributor 
our customers charge the significant discount back to us 
the chargeback approximates our sales price to our customers 
as a result  we do not recognize any net sales on shipments to these entities 
in estimating government chargeback reserves  we analyze actual chargeback amounts and apply historical chargeback rates to sales to which chargebacks apply 
chargebacks are generally applied by customers against their payments to us approximately to days after they have provided appropriate documentation to confirm their sale to a qualified government entity 
we estimate that approximately of our estimated acthar end user unit demand is used by patients covered by medicaid and other government related programs 
acthar gross sales were reduced by and to account for the estimated amount of medicaid rebates and government chargebacks for the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively 
effective january   we estimate that acthar gross sales resulting from our 
table of contents reported shipments will be reduced by approximately related to medicaid rebates and government chargebacks 
we routinely assess our experience with medicaid rebates and government chargebacks and adjust the reserves accordingly 
for sales of doral  we grant payment terms of  net days 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded as a reduction to trade accounts receivable and are estimated based upon the amount of trade accounts receivable subject to the cash discounts 
at december  and  sales related reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows december  in s product returns credit memoranda policy product returns product replacement policy medicaid rebates government chargebacks other inventories as of december  our net raw material and finished goods inventories totaled million 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for excess and obsolete inventory due to the expiration of shelf life of a product 
in estimating inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  we analyze i the expiration date  ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual future usage and demand for our products is less favorable than projected  additional inventory write offs may be required in the future which would increase our cost of product sales in the period of any write offs 
we intend to control inventory levels of our products purchased by our customers 
customer inventories may be compared to both internal and external databases to determine adequate inventory levels 
we may monitor our product shipments to customers and compare these shipments against prescription demand for our individual products 
intangible and long lived assets as of december  our intangible and long lived assets consisted of goodwill of  generated from a merger in  net purchased technology of million related to our acquisition of doral in may and  of net property and equipment 
the costs related to our acquisition of doral are being amortized over an estimated life of years 
the determination of whether or not our intangible and long lived assets are impaired and the expected useful lives of purchased technology involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require a write down of our recorded asset balances and a reduction in the expected useful life of our purchased technology 
such a write down of our recorded asset balances or reduction in the expected useful life of our purchased technology would increase our operating expenses 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
our fair value is compared to the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount  then no impairment is indicated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets  consisting of property and equipment and purchased technology  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use or disposition of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets carrying value is adjusted to fair value 
as of december  and  no impairment had been indicated 

table of contents share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and pre vesting forfeitures 
we estimated the expected term of stock options granted for the years ended december  and based on the simplified method provided in staff accounting bulletin no 
we estimated the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the pre vesting forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
prior to january   we accounted for share based payments to our employees and non employee members of our board of directors under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related guidance  as permitted by sfas no

measuring and assigning of compensation cost for share based grants made prior to  but not vested as of  the date of adopting sfas no 
r have been based upon the same estimate of grant date fair value previously disclosed under sfas no 
in a pro forma manner 
we did not recognize any significant share based employee compensation costs in our statements of operations prior to january   as options granted to employees and non employee members of our board of directors generally had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as required by sfas no 
 prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we provided pro forma disclosure of net income loss applicable to common shareholders as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
in the pro forma information for periods prior to  we accounted for pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred 
our operating results for prior periods have not been restated 
our net income for the year ended december  includes million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
our net loss for the year ended december  includes million of share based compensation expense related to employees and non employee members of our board of directors 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our employee stock purchase plan is expected to be recognized through august   which represents the end of the current month offering period 
on february   our board of directors approved a reduction in the offering period of the employee stock purchase plan to three months effective with the next offering period that begins on september   eliminated the ability of plan participants to increase their contribution levels during an offering period and authorized the addition of  shares to the plan 
the addition of the  shares to the plan is subject to shareholder approval 
lease termination liability we entered into an agreement to sublease laboratory and office space  including laboratory equipment  at our hayward  california facility in july  due to the termination of our then existing drug discovery programs 
the sublease on our hayward facility expired in july our obligations under the hayward master lease extend through november during the fourth quarter of  the sublessee notified us that they did not intend to extend the sublease beyond the end of july 
table of contents we determined that there was no loss associated with the hayward facility when we initially subleased the space as we expected cash inflows from the sublease to exceed our rent cost over the term of the master lease 
however  we reevaluated this in when the sublessee notified us that it would not be renewing the sublease beyond july as a result  we computed a loss and liability on the sublease in the fourth quarter of in accordance with fin accounting for a loss on a sublease  an interpretation of fasb and apb opinion no 
and ftb  accounting for the loss on a sublease not involving the disposal of a segment 
as of december  and  the estimated liability related to the hayward facility totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in lease termination and deferred rent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the liability was determined using a credit adjusted risk free rate to discount the estimated future net cash flows  consisting of the minimum lease payments under the master lease  net of estimated sublease rental income that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
the most significant assumption in estimating the lease termination liability relates to our estimate of future sublease income 
we base our estimate of sublease income  in part  on the opinion of independent real estate experts  current market conditions  and rental rates  among other factors 
adjustments to the lease termination liability will be required if actual sublease income differs from amounts currently expected 
we review all assumptions used in determining the estimated liability quarterly and revise our estimate of the liability to reflect changes in circumstances 
effective november   we subleased  square feet of the facility through april and effective february  we subleased the remaining  square feet through the remainder of the term of the master lease 
these subleases cover a portion of our lease commitment  and all of our insurance  taxes and common area maintenance 
over the remaining term of the master lease we anticipate that we will receive approximately million in sublease income to be used to pay a portion of our hayward facility obligation of million 
during the year ended december   we revised our estimate of the liability and recorded additional losses totaling we are also required to recognize an on going accretion expense representing the difference between the undiscounted net cash flows and the discounted net cash flows over the remaining term of the hayward master lease using the interest method 
the accretion amount represents an on going adjustment to the estimated liability 
the on going accretion expense and any revisions to the liability are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended december   and we recognized total expense of million   and  respectively  related to the hayward facility 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was not considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
based on taxable income in the third and fourth quarter of  cumulative taxable income for the most recent three years and anticipated taxable income for  we determined  in the fourth quarter of  that it was more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets would be recovered 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance for such deferred tax assets at december  and recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year 
table of contents ended december  the remaining valuation allowance at december  relates to deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain state temporary differences that may not be recovered until or subsequent years 
any changes in the valuation allowance based upon our future assessment will result in an income tax benefit if the valuation allowance is decreased  and an income tax expense if the valuation allowance is increased 
we recently completed a study of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to determine whether such amounts are limited under federal internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
as a result of the study  we concluded that certain of our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would not be available prior to their expiration 
accordingly  for the year ended december   we reversed million in fully reserved deferred tax assets related to such operating net loss and tax credit carryforwards  and the related valuation allowance 
the income tax benefit in the amount of million for the year ended december  results from the million reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that we believe will be recovered  based on anticipated taxable income in  which was offset by million of current tax expense for federal and california alternative minimum tax amt and other state income taxes 
the utilization of tax loss carryforwards is limited in the calculation of amt and  as a result  we recorded a current tax charge for amt in the year ended december  the current amt liability is available as a credit against future tax obligations upon the full utilization or expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognizing  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we implemented the provisions of fin no 
as of january  this resulted in the reversal of fully reserved deferred tax assets totaling  which relate to uncertain tax positions  and the related valuation allowance 
these unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized in full  would reduce our income tax expense by  and result in adjustments to other tax accounts  primarily deferred taxes 
we do not currently expect any significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within months of december  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of adopting fin no 
on january  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total net product sales years ended december  increase change in s net product sales total net product sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the year ended december  for the years ended december  and all net product sales were in the neurology therapeutic area 
net sales of acthar for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million during the same period in the increase in net sales resulted from the new acthar pricing level implemented in august in august we announced a new strategy and business model for acthar  and initiated a new pricing level for acthar that was effective august  under the new acthar strategy  our sales price to curascript  our specialty distributor of acthar  increased to  per vial based on a list price of  per vial 
the list price prior to the new pricing level was  per vial 
while total acthar units shipped have decreased since the implementation of the new acthar strategy  we shipped  acthar units to our specialty distributor at 
table of contents the new pricing level from the implementation of the new acthar strategy on august  through december  this continued ordering coupled with a positive pattern of insurance reimbursement resulted in a significant increase in our net sales for the year ended december  our specialty distributor ships acthar to specialty pharmacies and hospitals to meet end user demand 
we estimate that acthar end user demand since the implementation of the new acthar strategy has averaged in the range of to vials per month through january we track our own acthar shipments daily  but those shipments vary compared to end user demand because of seasonal usage and changes in inventory levels at specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
we estimate monthly acthar end user demand using patient referral data collected from our reimbursement support center and analysis of ordering patterns from specialty and hospital pharmacies 
we generally receive this information during the day period following the end of each month 
we shipped  vials of acthar to our specialty distributor during the fourth quarter of in the months since the august  price increase  acthar shipments to our specialty distributor have ranged from a low of vials in september to a high of vials in october during the fourth quarter of  there was an initial build up of acthar inventories within the newly established specialty pharmacy network that distributes acthar 
this resulted in acthar shipments during the fourth quarter that exceeded our end user demand estimate 
this variation in shipments follows a distinct historical pattern of significant quarter to quarter variability and apparent seasonality in acthar end user demand 
we evaluated the historical patterns of quarterly acthar usage within child neurology  as measured by wolters kluwer  a leading provider of prescription data for the pharmaceutical industry 
we tabulated the average retail demand for each quarter  from july to june  as a percentage of the overall average quarterly retail demand 
according to this data  while retail demand in child neurology  where acthar is now primarily used  stayed constant during the five year period july to june  variation from the mean was frequently observed for individual quarters 
for example  the third calendar quarter has historically been the strongest quarter at of the quarterly average  with a range of as low as to as high as 
the first calendar quarter  historically the weakest quarter at of average  has ranged from as low as to as high as of the average quarter during the july to june period 
we believe that this historical variability is due to quarter to quarter variations in diagnosis and treatment of the very small is patient population  coupled with some seasonal influences 
these factors make predictions about acthar vial demand for any specific short time period difficult and future variability in quarterly acthar orders and demand should be expected 
we estimate that approximately of our estimated acthar end user unit demand is used by patients covered by medicaid and other government related programs 
as required by federal regulations  we provide a rebate related to product dispensed to medicaid eligible patients and certain government entities are permitted to purchase our products for a nominal amount from our customers who charge back the significant discount to us 
these medicaid rebates and government chargebacks are estimated by us each quarter and reduce our gross sales in the determination of our net sales 
acthar gross sales were reduced by and to account for the estimated amount of medicaid rebates and government chargebacks for the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively 
effective january   we estimate that acthar gross sales resulting from our reported shipments will be reduced by approximately related to medicaid rebates and government chargebacks 
the medicaid rebate amount per unit is determined based on a formula established by statute and is subject to review and modification by the administrators of the medicaid program 
in connection with the implementation of the new pricing strategy for acthar  coupled with recent clarifications of the statute in july by program administrators  we initiated an extensive review of the medicaid statute and regulations 
after such review and consultation with our regulatory legal counsel  we prospectively modified how we determine our rebate amount per unit to conform with the statute 
the modification was implemented in august and communicated to the program administrators in september the modification increased net sales and net income applicable to common shareholders by million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this sales and income benefit ended during the fourth quarter of if annual acthar demand remains in the annualized range of  to  vials experienced since the implementation of the new acthar strategy  we estimate that this would result in annual net sales of approximately million to million 

table of contents cost of product sales years ended december  increase change in s cost of product sales cost of product sales for the year ended december  increased million from the year ended december  cost of product sales includes material cost  packaging  warehousing and distribution  product liability insurance  royalties  quality control which primarily includes product stability testing  quality assurance and reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred 
we incur a royalty of on total net sales of acthar to a third party and a royalty of of annual net sales over million to another third party 
the increase in cost of product sales was due primarily to an increase of million in royalties on acthar due to the increase in net sales during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in increases of  in product stability testing and  in distribution costs also contributed to the increase of cost of product sales in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in cost of product sales as a percentage of total net product sales was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of total net product sales in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was due primarily to the increase in net product sales resulting from the new acthar pricing level implemented in august we estimate that cost of sales as a percentage of sales for will be approximately

our employee stock purchase plan currently has a month offering period that ends on august  plan participants may contribute up to of their salary to the plan subject to certain maximum contribution levels 
plan participants purchase shares every three months and are able to increase their contribution levels during the offering period 
the purchase price is generally of the lower of our stock price at the beginning of the offering period or at a purchase date within the offering period 
the current offering period began on september  as a result of the significant increase in our stock price during the fourth quarter of  many plan participants increased their contributions to maximum levels for the current offering period 
this resulted in a significant increase in the non cash sfas no 
r expense for the current offering period 
on february   our board of directors approved a reduction in the offering period to three months effective with the next offering period that begins on september   eliminated the ability of plan participants to increase their contribution levels during an offering period and authorized the addition of  shares to the plan 
the addition of the  shares to the plan is subject to shareholder approval

research and development years ended december  increase change in s research and development research and development expense for the year ended december  increased million from the year ended december  the costs included in research and development relate primarily to our product development efforts  outside services related to medical and regulatory affairs  compliance activities  costs associated with our medical science liaisons  and our preliminary evaluation of additional product development opportunities 
the increase in research and development was due primarily to the addition of our clinical and development leadership team during the fourth quarter of and our medical science liaisons in the second quarter of headcount related costs increased by approximately million in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in an increase totaling approximately  for regulatory fees and patent related legal fees also contributed to the increase as compared to the same period in we estimate that our research and development expenses excluding non cash sfas no 
r share based compensation expense will be approximately million to million during resulting from our efforts related to the acthar submission to the fda for the treatment of is and the continued development of qsc the higher end of the range would only result in the event that we were to successfully advance qsc to clinical trials 
we estimate that total non cash sfas no

depreciation and amortization years ended december  increase change in s depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to amortization expense related to the doral purchased technology

our total purchase price  including acquisition costs  allocated to the doral product rights 
table of contents was million 
in addition  in january  we made a  payment to ivax to eliminate the doral royalty obligation that was also recorded to purchased technology

other income  net for the year ended december  increased by  from the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the reversal of an accrual of  in june related to an agreement with roberts pharmaceutical corporation  a subsidiary of shire pharmaceuticals ltd 
shire  a related party  as we determined that the amount would not be due to shire under the agreement 
the gain on sale of product rights related to emitasol 
in june  we divested our non core development stage product emitasol nasal metoclopramide which resulted in net proceeds of  under the terms of the agreement  we may receive a royalty on product sales of emitasol as well as future payments based on the achievement of certain clinical and commercial goals 
income tax expense benefit years ended december  increase in s income tax expense benefit income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share 
there was no income tax benefit or expense for the year ended december  as we incurred a net loss of million and maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
for the year ended december   we were able to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset the majority of our taxable income 
in addition  based on taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of  cumulative taxable income for the three most recent years and anticipated taxable income for  we determined in the fourth quarter of that it was more likely than not that some of our deferred tax assets at december  would be realized 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance for such deferred tax assets at december  and recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  this amount was offset by million of current tax expense for the federal and california alternative minimum tax amt and other state income taxes 
the utilization of the tax loss carryforwards to offset our taxable income is limited in the calculation of amt and as a result we recorded a current tax expense for amt for the year ended december  during  we estimate that our income tax expense will be recorded for financial reporting purposes at the maximum federal and state tax rates of approximately percent  however  we estimate that our income tax payments will be much lower due to our remaining net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and california research and development tax credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
during  we conducted a study based on historical changes in equity ownership  corporate valuations  and tax filings to determine if the utilization of any of these net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credits were subject to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes through december  this study concluded that million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards  all of our state net 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards   of our federal research and development tax credits  and all of our california research and development tax credits were available to reduce future taxable income 
after offsetting our taxable income for the year ended december   we had remaining federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  and federal and california research and development tax credits of  and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  and  and  of federal and california research and development credits  respectively  are available to reduce our taxable income 
however  we have established a valuation allowance of million at december  for deferred tax assets related to million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards   of federal research and development credit carryforwards   of california research and development credit carryforwards  and other state temporary differences  as it was not considered more likely than not as of december  that we would be able to utilize these tax assets to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and the federal research and development credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after december  such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available as of december  before utilization

allocation of undistributed earnings to series a preferred stock years ended december  increase in s allocation of undistributed earnings to series a preferred stock the million allocation of undistributed earnings to series a preferred stock for the year ended december  represented an allocation of a portion of our fiscal year net income to the series a preferred stock for purposes of determining net income applicable to common shareholders 
this is an accounting allocation only based on relative share holdings and was not an actual distribution or obligation to distribute a portion of our fiscal year net income to the series a stockholder 
net loss was not allocated to the series a preferred stock for the year ended december  as the series a preferred stock does not have a contractual obligation to share in our losses 
on february   we completed the repurchase of the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock from shire pharmaceuticals  inc for cash consideration of million or per share the same price per preferred share as the closing price per share of our common stock on february  
the existence of the series a preferred stock created a complex capital structure that limited our flexibility in developing a long term strategy and required us to take into consideration the interest of the preferred stockholder 
for example  among other rights associated with the series a preferred stock  the series a preferred stock was convertible into  shares of common stock  had a million liquidation preference  and required us to obtain the holder s separate approval in the 
table of contents event of a merger transaction 
as of december   the series a preferred stock had a carrying amount of million as reflected on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the million difference between the million repurchase payment and the million balance sheet carrying value of the series a preferred stock will be accounted for as a deemed dividend and will therefore reduce our net income in the determination of net income applicable to common shareholders for our first quarter ending march  the repurchase transaction will have no income tax impact

the series b preferred stockholders had the option to convert all or part of their series b preferred stock into our common stock prior to the redemption date 
during the year ended december  we issued  shares of our common stock to the series b stockholders upon conversion of  shares of series b preferred stock

in april and may   shares of our common stock were issued upon the cashless net exercise of  warrants issued to certain series b stockholders 
cash requirements based on our internal forecasts and projections  we believe that our cash resources at december  will be sufficient to fund operations through at least december  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of product sales  returns of expired product  strategic transactions  if any  licensing of products  technologies or compounds  if any  our ability to manage growth  competing technological and market developments  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  the receipt of licensing or milestone fees from current or future collaborative and license agreements  if established  the timing of regulatory approvals  any expansion or acceleration of our development programs  and other factors 
if our cash resources at december  are not sufficient to meet our obligations  or if we have insufficient funds to acquire additional products or expand our operations  we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
however  traditional asset based debt financing has not been available on acceptable terms 
additionally  we may seek to raise additional capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on desirable terms or at all
