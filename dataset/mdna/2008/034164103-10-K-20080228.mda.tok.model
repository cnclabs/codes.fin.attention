executive overview grain ethanol group the grain ethanol group operates grain elevators in ohio  michigan  indiana and illinois 
in addition to storage and merchandising  the group performs grain trading risk management and other services for its customers 
the group is also the developer and significant investor in three ethanol facilities located in indiana  michigan and ohio with a nameplate capacity of million gallons 
in addition to its investment in these ethanol facilities  the group operates the facilities under management contracts and provides grain origination  ethanol and ddg marketing and risk management services for which it is separately compensated 
the group is also a significant investor in lansing trade group llc  an established trading business with offices throughout the country 
the corn crop proved to be a record with million bushels of production  a increase from according to us department of agriculture 
driven by factors such as favorable prices  growing ethanol demand and strong export sales  acres of corn planted increased over and yields averaged bushels per acre  the second highest yield on record after  in which yields were bushels per acre 
the shift to corn acres resulted in less acres of other grains such as soybeans and wheat 
according to the us department of agriculture  farmers planted fewer soybean acres in than in with the price of soybeans rising over the same period last year  the company expects that for the harvest  some of the increased corn acres will be switched back to soybeans and wheat 
the agricultural commodity based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices 
therefore  increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the company deals in  will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a minimal impact on gross profit 
as a result  the significant increase in sales for the period is not necessarily indicative of the group s overall performance and more focus should be placed on changes to merchandising revenues and service income 
a portion of the sales increase relates to the company s position as the ethanol marketer for its ethanol ventures 
in this role the company buys ethanol from its ventures and then resells the ethanol to ethanol blenders 
for this service  it earns a volume based fee rather than a traditional sales margin 
grain inventories on hand at december  were million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
production at the clymers  indiana ethanol plant began in early may production at the greenville  ohio ethanol plant began in february two of the ethanol ventures in which the company has interests  the andersons albion ethanol llc and the andersons clymers ethanol llc have the majority of their ethanol margins locked in through the use of forward purchase contracts for corn and natural gas and forward sale contracts of ethanol 
the andersons marathon ethanol llc does not  therefore  volatility in corn and ethanol prices will have a greater impact on this entity s profitability for rail group the rail group buys  sells  leases  rebuilds and repairs various types of used railcars and rail equipment 
the group also provides fleet management services to fleet owners and operates a custom steel fabrication business 
the group has a diversified fleet of car types boxcars  gondolas  covered and open top hoppers  tank cars and pressure differential cars and locomotives and also serves a diversified customer base 
railcars and locomotives under management owned  leased or managed for financial institutions in non recourse arrangements at december  were  compared to  at december  with overall us rail traffic decreasing more than over the last year  the group s utilization rate railcars and locomotives under management that are in lease service  exclusive of railcars managed for third party investors has fallen slightly from at december  to at december  this along with increased maintenance costs  had an adverse impact on the group s results for the period 
in december  the american association of railroads announced that they will be increasing their car repair facility labor rate by over effective january  the company expects that this will also cause an increase in private shop rates and will likely increase the group s maintenance expenses further going forward 
during  the group opened new railcar repair shops in rains  south carolina and macon  georgia

the group will continue to evaluate opportunities for additional shops 
plant nutrient group the company s plant nutrient group purchases  stores  formulates  manufactures and sells dry and liquid fertilizer to dealers and farmers as well as sells reagents for air pollution control technologies used in coal fired power plants 
in addition  they provide warehousing and services to manufacturers and customers  formulate liquid anti icers and deicers for use on roads and runways and distribute seeds and various farm supplies 
the major fertilizer ingredients sold by the company are nitrogen  phosphate and potash 
as stated previously  us corn acreage in has increased over last year and the company s year to date average corn sales price has risen 
the significant rise in corn prices  along with increased demand for export and to supply ethanol plants  has contributed to the increase in acreage 
this has benefited the plant nutrient group significantly  as corn requires more nutrients than other crops 
because of this  volumes have increased over the same period last year 
weather  as well as the pricing relationship between corn  wheat and soybeans  will play an important role in the outlook for as farmers begin to make decisions about the next crop year 
as mentioned previously  high wheat and soybean prices are expected to cause some producers to switch acres from corn  to wheat and soybeans  which require less nutrients 
going into  the group will continue to evaluate the availability of its raw materials  primarily potash  which at this time is in tight supply 
a shortage of available raw material will impact the group s ability to meet customer orders 
turf specialty group the turf specialty group produces granular fertilizer products for the professional lawn care and golf course markets 
it also produces private label fertilizer and corncob based animal bedding and cat litter for the consumer markets 
the turf products industry is highly seasonal  with the majority of sales occurring from early spring to early summer 
corncob based products are sold throughout the year 
as part of the restructuring plan announced in by the turf specialty group  many new value added products were introduced and  in spite of high raw material prices this year  average gross margins in the lawn business have improved when compared to the same period last year 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  the manufacturing facility which manufactures a patented fertilizer product primarily for use on golf course greens became fully operational 
with this increased capacity  the group has begun the launch of several new products for the season 
as mentioned previously  one of the group s primary raw materials  potash  is in tight supply 
a shortage of available raw materials will impact the group s ability to meet customer orders 
in  the cob business was challenged by a shortage of cobs which resulted in increased raw material costs 
the cob harvest proved to be much better than last year and the group is expecting a reduction in outsourced cobs for retail group the retail group includes six stores operated as the andersons  which are located in the columbus  lima and toledo  ohio markets 
in the second quarter of  the group opened a new specialty food store operated as the andersons market  located in the toledo  ohio market

the sales include million in sales of corn to the ethanol llcs in which the company invests in 
this compares to sales of million in while the escalation in grain prices in contributed to the increase in grain sales with the average price per bushel sold increasing  volumes also increased almost and can be attributed primarily to the increased sales to the ethanol llcs 
both the volume and price increases can be attributed to the increased demand for corn from the ethanol industry 
merchandising revenues increased million  or over most of this increase came in space income through basis appreciation and storage income  as there were more wheat bushels in storage in than there were in customer service fees earned for forward contracting also increased substantially 
sales of ethanol totaled million for the year compared to just million in service fees earned for services provided to ethanol facilities  which include management fees  corn origination fees and ethanol and ddg marketing fees were million in  an increase of million  as two of the facilities that the company provides services for were fully operational for all or a portion of in  only one facility was operational during the second half of the year

gross margin in this line of business remained relatively flat year over year 
in the cob business  gross profit decreased million  or  due to a cob shortage during the first half of the year which required the group to purchase processed cobs from a third party at higher costs 
as mentioned previously  the cob harvest at the end of was much better than the previous year and is expected to contribute to improved results in as the need to outsource processed cobs will be less 
both operating expenses and interest expense experienced only slight changes over the prior year 
a majority of the decrease in other income is the result of a non recurring gain in from an insurance settlement received for one of its cob tanks that had previously been destroyed in a fire 
retail group sales and merchandising revenues cost of sales gross profit operating  administrative and general interest expense other income  net operating income operating results for the retail group decreased million  or  over total sales increased slightly for the year however same store sales decreased nearly

sales for the group increased million from the harvest results were better than in the company s market area for all grains with a increase in soybean production  a increase in wheat production and a increase in corn production 
a delayed harvest caused a short supply of grain which the group was able to take advantage of with pre harvest inventory 
this  coupled with the increasing price of corn  contributed to the increase in sales 
merchandising revenues for the group increased million

while sales of railcars and related leases increased million  the gross profit on those sales decreased million 
this was mostly the result of a large sale in the fourth quarter of that realized significant margins 
leasing revenue in the rail group increased million due to an increase in the company s rail fleet and increased lease rates 
gross profit on railcar leases decreased slightly for the year 
the main driver of the decrease was a million increase in maintenance costs over last year 
sales in the railcar repair and fabrication shops increased million  over half of which is due to the addition of the repair shop in mississippi and the added work as a result of hurricane katrina 
the remaining increase is due to the two new product lines which were added in the second half of and contributed a full year of sales in gross profit for the repair and fabrication shops increased million with increases experienced at all of the group s shops 
operating  administrative and general expenses for the group increased million

generally  these increases can be passed through to customers  although price increases have also resulted in decreased demand causing the decrease in volume 
operating  administrative and general expenses decreased million

changes in product mix have caused sales to increase by million and gross profit to increase by million 
sales per ton increased and gross profit per ton increased in the turf specialty group also saw improvements in their operating  administrative and general expenses of million 
a portion of this is the result of one time termination benefits and fixed asset write downs in the amount of million that occurred in related to the group s restructuring as well as million in property losses and additional expense related to a fire at one of the group s cob tanks in the remaining million decrease in expenses can be attributed to the group s more efficient structure due to the restructuring and improved asset utilization 
other income for the group increased million  a majority of which was reimbursement from the insurance company for losses incurred as a result of the cob tank fire mentioned previously

customer counts remained relatively unchanged  however the average sale per customer decreased 
despite the decrease in sales  gross profit in the retail group decreased less than 
taking out the impact of the rd week in  gross profit improved in by  or million 
most of this improvement can be attributed to enhanced inventory control processes  which resulted in lower inventory shrink adjustments in operating  administrative and general expenses decreased million 
while the group benefited from decreases in employee benefits expense due in part to plan changes to the defined benefit pension plan  a portion of the benefit was offset by increased performance incentives and stock compensation expense 
additionally  the group was able to better utilize its employees  reducing labor expense 
other sales and merchandising revenues cost of sales gross profit operating  administrative and general interest expense other income  net operating loss net corporate expense not allocated to business segments decreased million  or  from due mainly to decreases in employee benefits expense including favorable health care claim experience and changes in both the defined benefit retirement and retiree healthcare plans 
this was partially offset by increased stock compensation expense for corporate employees and additional charitable giving 
the million increase in the corporate interest credit resulted from increases in certain float benefits that are not passed back to the operating segments

short term borrowings used to fund these margin calls and other company operations increased million from december  net working capital at december  was million  an increase of million from december  undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million over and resulted from the performance of the company s investments in lansing trade group  llc  the andersons albion ethanol llc and the andersons clymers ethanol llc 
the company expects to receive a cash distribution from each of these investments in the company made income tax payments of million in investing activities total capital spending for on property  plant and equipment was million  which includes million in the plant nutrient group  million in the grain ethanol group  million in the retail group  million in the turf specialty group  million in the rail group and million in corporate purchases

peak borrowing on the line of credit during both short term and long term was million on december  as of january   the company had accessed the flex line and the balance on the short term line of credit was million 
typically  the company s highest borrowing occurs in the spring due to seasonal inventory requirements in the fertilizer and retail businesses  credit sales of fertilizer and a customary reduction in grain payables due to the cash needs and market strategies of grain customers 
with the unprecedented rise in commodity prices  the company has seen a substantial increase in cash needs and expects this trend to continue 
the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its cbot futures contracts 
conversely  in periods of declining prices  the company receives a return of cash

off balance sheet transactions the company s rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease

grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain and ethanol  over the counter ethanol contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the grain inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
commodity derivative contracts represent forward purchase and sale contracts and both exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets  as well as counter party non performance risk in the case of forward and over the counter contracts 
unprecedented market conditions in the grain industry have led to increases in the risk of non performance by the counterparties 
the amount of risk  and therefore the impact to the fair value of the contracts  varies by type of contract and type of counter party 
changes in market value are recorded as a component of sales and merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories  commodity derivative assets and liabilities and sales and merchandising revenues could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories  commodity derivative assets and liabilities and sales and merchandising revenues could differ 
because the company marks to market inventories and sales commitments  gross profit on a grain or ethanol sale transaction is recognized when a contract for sale of the grain is executed 
the related revenue is recognized upon shipment of the grain or ethanol  at which time title transfers and customer acceptance occurs 
grain inventories contain valuation reserves established to recognize the difference in quality and value between contractual grades and the actual quality grades of inventory held by the company 
these quality reserves also require management to exercise judgment 
impairment of long lived assets the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or rolling stock 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets that may be impacted 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
employee benefit plans the company provides all full time  non retail employees with pension benefits and full time employees hired before january  with postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
in  the company amended its defined benefit pension plans effective january  the provisions of this amendment include freezing benefits for the retail line of business employees as of december   modifying the calculation of benefits for the non retail line of business employees as of december  with future benefits to be calculated using a new career average formula and in the case of all employees  compensation for the years through will be includable in the final average pay formula calculating the final benefit earned for years prior to december  stock compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r using the black scholes method of valuation 
the company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used were to change significantly  or if a different valuation model were used  stock based compensation expense may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in fixed price purchase and sale commitments for grain and grain held in inventory  the company enters into exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for economic hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
in addition  inventory values are affected by the month to month spread relationships in the regulated futures markets  as the company carries inventories over time 
these spread relationships are also less volatile than the overall market value and tend to follow historical patterns but also represent a risk that cannot be directly offset 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december  in thousands net long position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december  in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of less than carrying value market risk
