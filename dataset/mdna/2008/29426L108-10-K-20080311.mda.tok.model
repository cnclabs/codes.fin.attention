as such  management is required to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies which are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company enters into contractual arrangements with end users that may include licensing of the company s software products  product support and maintenance services  consulting services  resale of third party hardware or various combinations thereof  including the sale of such products or services separately 
the company s accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements is fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers many factors when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america related to revenue recognition 
these factors include  but are not limited to the actual contractual terms  such as payment terms  delivery dates and pricing of the various product and service elements of a contract  availability of products to be delivered  time period over which services are to be performed  
table of contents creditworthiness of the customer  the complexity of customizations and integrations to the company s software required by service contracts  the sales channel through which the sale is made direct  var  distributor  etc  discounts given for each element of a contract  any commitments made as to installation or implementation go live dates and whether vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists 
each of the relevant factors is analyzed to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer 
management is required to make judgments regarding the significance of each factor in applying the revenue recognition standards  as well as whether or not each factor complies with such standards 
any misjudgment or error by management in its evaluation of the factors and the application of the standards  especially with respect to complex or new types of transactions  could have a material adverse affect on the company s future revenues and operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable go through a collection process that is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with customers at specified intervals and assistance from other personnel within the company who have a relationship with the customer 
the company writes off accounts to its allowance when the company has determined that collection is not likely 
the company believes no significant concentrations of credit risk existed at december  receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections performance and specific collection issues 
if actual bad debts differ from the reserves calculated  the company records an adjustment to bad debt expense in the period in which the difference occurs 
such adjustment could result in additional charges to the company s results of operations 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets were recorded as a result of the company s acquisitions and represent acquired technology  customer base and trademarks 
these intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the intangible assets and considers any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
any material changes in circumstances  such as large decreases in revenue or the discontinuation of a particular product line  could require future write downs in the company s intangibles assets and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
goodwill the company s goodwill was recorded as a result of the company s acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the company has recorded these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed an impairment review of its recorded goodwill in and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed because the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
the company tests its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if indicators of potential impairment exist  by determining if the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
factors that could trigger an impairment include  but are not limited to  underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
future impairment reviews may require write downs in the company s goodwill and could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the periods in which such write downs occur 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected 
table of contents dividends  volatility  terms and estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from the estimate  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
beginning in  the company changed its previous practice by no longer granting stock options to employees  and granting restricted stock as an alternative 
compensation expense for restricted stock is based on the fair market value of the restricted stock on its grant date  and is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
income taxes income taxes are determined under guidelines prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability and has established a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
during the year ended december   the company determined  primarily based on operating income during recent years and anticipated operating income and cash flows for future periods that it is more likely than not that certain foreign deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and accordingly  it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
as a result  the company released a portion of the valuation allowance related to certain foreign jurisdictions  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit to net income  as well as a credit to goodwill as some of the deferred tax assets existed at the date of scala s acquisition 
the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for the remaining foreign deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
the remaining valuation allowance will continue to be evaluated over future quarters 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of these remaining foreign deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset future taxable income  the valuation allowance could be decreased or eliminated altogether which will result primarily in a decrease to goodwill 
future releases of the valuation allowance related to these assets will be accounted for as a reduction of goodwill rather than a reduction of income tax expense if the valuation allowance decrease occurs prior to the effective date of sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas no 
r 
effective january   sfas r provides that any reduction to the valuation allowance established in purchase accounting is to be accounted for as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   the company adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although the company believes it has adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 

table of contents during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are supportable  the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made

in july  the fasb issued a proposed staff position fsp apb a that applies to convertible debt instruments  including the company s convertible senior notes  that may be settled in whole or in part with cash upon conversion 
the proposed fsp apb a would require the company to allocate a portion of the proceeds of the notes to the embedded conversion feature  based on the estimated fair value of the conversion feature 
the conversion feature would be accounted for as a discount on the notes and amortized as non cash interest expense over the expected term of the notes  resulting in an increase to the company s reported interest expense 
if the proposed fsp apb a is issued in its current form  the company would be required to adopt it as of january   retroactively applied to the may issuance date of the notes  with the cumulative effect charged to retained earnings 
the proposed fsp could materially impact the company s results of operations and earnings per share  but would have no impact on the company s cash flows

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the company operates in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the us accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of tax related assets and liabilities and income tax provisions 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
in addition  the company has made estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets 
the company recorded a provision benefit for income taxes of million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory us federal income tax rate of  primarily due to state and foreign income tax and permanent differences between gaap pre tax income and taxable income for the year ended december  and benefits from the release of valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets for the year ended december  the company had provided a valuation allowance of million as of december  on of its net deferred tax assets as it had been determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
as previously disclosed  the company continually assesses its valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets 
during  the company released the valuation allowance related to substantially all us federal and state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
for the remaining deferred tax assets the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
although the company has determined that a valuation allowance is no longer required with respect to the us federal deferred tax asset  recovery is dependent on achieving our forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
the company will review the forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change the company s assessment regarding the recoverability of its net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional tax expense and could have a significant impact on the company s earnings in future periods 
additionally  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related interpretations  future period reductions to the valuation allowance related to scala s deferred tax assets that existed as of the date of acquisition of scala are first credited against goodwill  then to the unamortized balance of other identifiable intangible assets recorded at the date of acquisition  and then  once these assets have been reduced to zero  credited to the income tax provision 
the company is currently under examination in various locations including the netherlands  the united kingdom  hungary and canada 
the company does not believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

foreign currency risk the company has several operations in foreign locations around the world 
these operations incur revenue and expenses in various foreign currencies 
revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar expose the company to foreign currency market risk 
unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies may have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
these foreign currency market movements could create a foreign currency gain or loss that could be realized or unrealized for the company 
the company s board of directors has approved a foreign currency risk policy that allows the company to enter into forward contracts and purchase option agreements to hedge foreign currency risks

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash and cash equivalents  cash designated for acquisition and outstanding debt 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in cash designated for acquisition 
based on the investment interest rate and the balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis  as well as decrease the company s net income and cash flows from operations 
the company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
deposits with its us issuers may exceed the amounts of federal deposit insurance provided on such deposits  and deposits held outside the us are not afforded such protection 
the company is averse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company has not experienced any losses on deposits of cash or cash equivalents 
the company cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on its variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
changes in interest rates do not affect the amount of interest we pay on our fixed rate senior convertible notes  but do affect the fair value of the debt 
foreign currency risk 
the company had three open option contracts related to the acquisition of nsb retail systems see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  and no foreign currency forward contracts open as of december  international revenues represented of the company s total revenues for the year ended december   and of revenues were denominated in foreign currencies 
included in interest and other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operation are net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains losses for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to inter company revenues and cost of sales  marking the company s option contracts to market and translating inter company balances and non functional currency cash balances 
given a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and other major currencies during the year ended december   net unrealized and realized transaction gain would increase or decrease by approximately million  as well as increase or decrease the company s net income and cash flows from operations for the respective periods
