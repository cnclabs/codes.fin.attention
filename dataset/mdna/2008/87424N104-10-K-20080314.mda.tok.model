table of contents the talent management market talent management encompasses multiple complex processes with interconnected elements that together play a vital role in attracting  sourcing  assessing  hiring  developing and aligning human capital to our customers business objectives 
most organizations no longer view human capital solely as an expense to be minimized  but instead as an asset to be optimized 
this shift in thinking has mirrored the evolution of talent management from a manual  paper based practice to a technology enabled  organization wide strategic business initiative 
over the past several years  organizations have implemented systems to automate many critical business functions 
while this automation has generated large volumes of data and business information  the critical knowledge within organizations resides with its employees 
accordingly  much of the value of the organization resides in its human capital 
to increase their return on investment in human capital  organizations have begun to shift their focus from traditional cost and time per hire metrics to more strategic considerations 
these considerations include quality of hire  time to productivity  internal mobility  employee retention  employee engagement  and employee contribution measures 
systematically pursuing these goals increases overall workforce productivity by enabling talent to be more optimally assigned and redeployed to address business needs 
a comprehensive  unified view of talent management requires solutions that not only automate discrete recruiting and performance management transactions  but also improve the effectiveness and consistency of recruiting and talent management processes through a more consistent competencies inventory management process  thereby increasing the quality of hire  employee retention  and productivity 
our software as a service delivery model our on demand  software as a service  delivery model enables our proprietary software solutions to be accessed and used by our customers remotely through an internet connection and a standard web browser 
our solutions are hosted and maintained by us  thus eliminating for our customers the time  risk  headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications within their own information technology infrastructures 
as a result  our solutions require less initial investment in third party software  hardware and implementation services  and have lower ongoing support costs than traditional enterprise software 
the saas model also allows advanced information technology infrastructure management  security  disaster recovery and other best practices to be leveraged by smaller customers that might not otherwise be able to implement such practices in their own information technology environments 
our solutions were designed and developed for delivery via the saas model from our inception 
our saas delivery model also enables us to take advantage of operational efficiencies 
since updates and upgrades to our solutions are managed by us on behalf of our customers  we are able to implement improvements to our solutions in a more rapid and uniform way 
as a result  we are required to support fewer old versions of our solutions 
this allows our development resources to focus more effort on innovative new products 
our saas delivery model  coupled with our subscription based license model  effectively replaces the large  front loaded cost  typical of most traditional enterprise software deployments  with a lower risk  pay as you go model 
we believe the saas model is well suited to the talent management market in which we operate

risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition  past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
we have a history of losses  and we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability 
prior to the year ended december   we incurred annual losses since our inception 
as of december  we had incurred aggregate net losses of million  which is our accumulated deficit of million less million of dividends and issuance costs on preferred stock 
we may incur losses in the future as a result of expenses associated with the continued development and expansion of our business and requirements of being a public company 
as we implement initiatives to grow our business  which include  among other things  acquisitions  international expansion and new product development  any failure to increase revenue or manage our cost structure could prevent us from completing these initiatives and sustaining profitability 
as a result  our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our existing customers do not renew their software subscriptions and buy additional solutions from us  our business will suffer 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of software subscriptions and  to a lesser extent  service fees from our existing customers 
as a result  maintaining the renewal rate of our software subscriptions is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the renewal rate for our solutions include the price  performance and functionality of our solutions  the availability  price  performance and functionality of competing products and services  the effectiveness of our maintenance and support services  our ability to develop complementary products and services  and the stability  performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services 
most of our taleo enterprise edition customers enter into software subscription agreements with a duration of three years or more from the initial contract date 
most of our taleo business edition customers enter into annual software subscription agreements 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of the initial term of their agreements 
in addition  our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal  which may reduce our revenue from these customers  or may request that we license our software to them on a perpetual basis  which may  after we have ratably recognized the revenue for the perpetual license over the relevant term in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  reduce recurring revenue from these customers 
under certain circumstances  our customers may cancel their subscriptions for our solutions prior to the expiration of the term 
our future success also depends  in part  on our ability to sell new products and services to our existing customers 
if our customers terminate their agreements  fail to renew their agreements  renew their agreements upon less favorable terms  or fail to buy new products and services from us  our revenue may decline or our future revenue may be constrained 
because we recognize revenue from software subscriptions over the term of the agreement  a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results  which increases the difficulty of evaluating our future financial position 
we generally recognize revenue from software subscription agreements ratably over the terms of these agreements  which are typically three or more years for our taleo enterprise edition customers and one year for our taleo business edition customers 
as a result  a substantial majority of our software subscription revenue in each quarter is generated from software subscription agreements entered into during prior periods 
consequently  a decline in new software subscription agreements in any one quarter may not affect our results of operations in that 
table of contents quarter but will reduce our revenue in future quarters 
additionally  the timing of renewals or non renewals of a software subscription agreement during any one quarter may also affect our financial performance in that particular quarter 
for example  because we recognize revenue ratably  the non renewal of a software subscription agreement late in a quarter will have very little impact on revenue for that quarter  but will reduce our revenue in future quarters 
accordingly  the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our solutions may not be reflected in our short term results of operations  which would make these reported results less indicative of our future financial results 
by contrast  a non renewal occurring early in a quarter may have a significant negative impact on revenue for that quarter and we may not be able to offset a decline in revenue due to such non renewals with revenue from new software subscription agreements entered into in the same quarter 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our costs in response to reduced revenue 
if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful  our revenue growth will be adversely affected 
in order to grow our business  we must continually add new customers 
our ability to attract new customers will depend in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts 
however  our prospective customers may not be familiar with our solutions  or may have traditionally used other products and services for their talent management requirements 
in addition  our prospective customers may develop their own solutions to address their talent management requirements  purchase competitive product offerings  or engage third party providers of outsourced talent management services that do not use our solution to provide their services 
if our prospective customers do not perceive our products and services to be of sufficiently high value and quality  we may not be able to attract new customers 
additionally  some new customers may request that we license our software to them on a perpetual basis  which may  after we have ratably recognized the revenue for the perpetual license over the relevant term in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  reduce recurring revenue from these customers 
to date  we have completed a limited number of agreements with such terms 
unfavorable economic conditions and reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business 
our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in economic conditions globally and within the industries in which our customers operate 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for enterprise application software and services 
most of our revenue is currently derived from large organizations whose businesses may fluctuate with global economic and business conditions 
historically  economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in corporate information technology spending by large organizations 
accordingly  the current downturn in global economic conditions may weaken demand for our software and services 
in addition  an economic decline impacting a particular industry may negatively impact demand for our software and services in the affected industry 
some of the industries we serve  for example financial services and technology  have recently suffered a downturn in economic and business conditions and may continue to do so 
a softening of demand for enterprise application software and services  and in particular enterprise talent management solutions  caused by a weakening global economy or economic downturn in a particular sector would adversely effect our business and likely cause a decline in our revenue 
if we do not compete effectively with companies offering talent management solutions  our revenue may not grow and could decline 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense competition from a number of companies 
our taleo enterprise edition solution competes with vendors of enterprise resource planning software such as oracle corporation and sap ag  and also with vendors such as adp  authoria  cezane  cornerstone ondemand  halogen software  hrsmart  jobpartners  kenexa  kronos  peopleclick  pilat  plateau  salary 
com  stepstone  successfactors  technomedia  teds  vurv  workday  and workstream  that offer products and services that compete with one or more modules in our taleo enterprise edition suite of solutions 
our taleo business edition solution competes primarily with bullhorn  hiredesk  icims  openhire  monster 
com  virtual edge from adp and vurv express from vurv 
our competitors may announce new products  services or enhancements that better meet changing industry standards or the price or performance needs of customers 
increased competition may cause 
table of contents pricing pressure and loss of market share  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  development  marketing  sales  service and other resources than we have 
some of these companies also have a larger installed base of customers  longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we have 
certain of our competitors provide products that may incorporate capabilities which are not available in our current suite of solutions  such as automated payroll and benefits  or services that we do not currently offer  such as recruitment process outsourcing services 
products with such additional functionalities may be appealing to some customers because they can reduce the number of different types of software or applications used to run their business and such additional services may be viewed by some customers as enhancing the effectiveness of a competitor s solutions 
in addition  our competitors products may be more effective than our products at performing particular talent management functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in a given market 
further  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in customer requirements 
our customers often require our products to be integrated with software provided by our existing or potential competitors 
these competitors could alter their products in ways that inhibit integration with our products  or they could deny or delay access by us to advance software releases  which would restrict our ability to adapt our products to facilitate integration with these new releases and could result in lost sales opportunities 
in addition  many organizations have developed or may develop internal solutions to address talent management requirements that may be competitive with our solutions 
the mergers of or potential mergers of our competitors or other similar strategic alliances could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenue 
the market in which we operate appears to be in the midst of a period of vendor consolidation 
if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors  the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
for example  kronos acquired unicru in and recently acquired deploy solutions 
kronos itself was acquired in by the private equity firm hellman friedman 
additionally  kenexa acquired brassring in and adp acquired virtualedge in unicru  brassring  virtualedge and deploy solutions have been direct competitors of ours in the past and it is unclear what impact these acquisitions will have on our market and our long term ability to compete against the combined companies 
our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future bpo partners  hro partners  systems integrators  third party consulting firms or other parties with whom we have relationships  thereby limiting our ability to promote our products and limiting the number of consultants available to implement our solutions 
disruptions in our business caused by these events could reduce our revenue 
in connection with the december  year end audit we identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that led us to restate our consolidated financial statements and we cannot be certain restatements will not occur again 
in connection with the december  year end audit of our financial statements  management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
these were matters that in our judgment could have adversely affected our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in our financial statements and were deemed to be material weaknesses 
in particular  we discovered errors in respect to depreciation of fixed assets  and accrual of dividends on preferred stock which required adjustment 
as a result  we restated our consolidated financial statements 
we also identified a failure to appropriately apply gaap to certain aspects of our financial reporting resulting from the lack of a properly designed financial reporting processes and a lack of sufficient technical accounting expertise 
certain of such deficiencies were also deemed to be material weaknesses 
we have remediated all known material weaknesses that were identified as part of the december  year end audit  however  we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken will ensure that those or similar deficiencies and a resulting restatement will not occur in the future 
execution of restatements like the one described above could 
table of contents create a significant strain on our internal resources  cause delays in our filing of quarterly financial results  increase our costs and cause management distraction 
failure to implement and maintain the appropriate internal controls over financial reporting could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate and timely financial information 
during we completed a review and redesign of our internal controls over financial reporting related to our closing procedures and processes  our calculations of our reported numbers  including depreciation expense and fixed assets  and the need to strengthen our technical accounting expertise 
despite these efforts  we identified a material weakness in connection with the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls as of march  prior to the filing of our financial results for the period ended march   related to the identification of a material adjustment required  which affected cash  accounts receivable and cash flow from operations 
we continue to focus on improvements in our controls over financial reporting and will continue to do so in we have discussed deficiencies in our financial reporting and remediation of such deficiencies with the audit committee of our board of directors and will continue to do so as required 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to remediate all deficiencies in the future 
any current or future deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
our financial performance may be difficult to forecast as a result of our historical focus on large customers and the long sales cycle associated with our solutions 
the majority of our revenue is currently derived from organizations with complex talent management requirements 
accordingly  in a particular quarter the majority of our bookings from new customers on an aggregate contract value basis are from large sales made to a relatively small number of customers 
as such  our failure to close a sale in a particular quarter will impede desired revenue growth unless and until the sale closes 
in addition  sales cycles for our taleo enterprise edition clients are generally between three months and one year  and in some cases can be longer 
as a result  substantial time and cost may be spent attempting to secure a sale that may not be successful 
the period between our first sales call on a prospective customer and a contract signing is relatively long due to several factors such as the complex nature of our solutions  the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions  the relatively long duration of our contracts  the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  the competitive evaluation of our solutions  fluctuations in the staffing management requirements of our prospective customers  announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors  and the lengthy purchasing approval processes of our prospective customers 
if our sales cycles unexpectedly lengthen  our ability to forecast accurately the timing of sales in any given period will be adversely affected and we may not meet our forecasts for that period 
if we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance our existing products to meet the needs of our existing and future customers  our sales will decline 
to keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and services 
for instance  in february our performance management software product became generally available in the market 
any new products we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue 
if we are unable to develop or acquire new products that appeal to our target customer base or enhance our existing products or if we fail to price our products to meet market demand or if the products we develop or acquire do not meet performance expectations 
table of contents or have a higher than expected cost structure to host and maintain  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
our efforts to expand our solutions beyond our current offerings or beyond the talent management market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business  which may harm our existing business 
we expect to incur additional expense to develop software products and to integrate acquired software products into existing platforms to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  we intend to invest in software development locations other than the locations where we currently develop our software 
such locations may include locations in eastern europe  russia  asia and other locations outside of north america  and we may engage independent contractors for all or portions of this work 
these efforts may not result in commercially viable solutions  may be more expensive or less productive than we anticipate  or may be difficult to manage and result in distraction to our management team 
if we do not manage these remote development centers effectively or receive significant revenue from our product development investments  our business will be adversely affected 
additionally  we intend to maintain a single version of each release of our software applications that is configurable to meet the needs of our customers 
customers may require customized solutions or features and functions that we do not yet offer and do not intend to offer in future releases  which may disrupt out ability to maintain a single version of our software releases or cause our customers to choose a competing solution 
acquisitions and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions  which would harm our business  operating results and overall financial condition 
in addition  we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating other companies 
we have made  and may continue to make  acquisitions or investments in companies  products  services  and technologies to expand our product offerings  customer base and business 
we have limited experience in executing acquisitions 
acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks  including the following being unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  discovering that we may have difficulty integrating the accounting systems  operations  and personnel of the acquired business  and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products into our existing code base  problems arising from differences in the revenue  licensing or support model of the acquired business  customer confusion regarding the positioning of acquired technologies or products  difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations  difficulty retaining the acquired business customers  and problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies 
the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we should proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any such acquisition 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  material one time write offs  or purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges 
they may also result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets in our financial statements which may be subject to future impairment charges or ongoing amortization costs  thereby reducing future earnings 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as incurring expenses that may impact operating results 

table of contents we are discontinuing the time and expense processing services of our taleo contingent solution and intend to provide time and expense processing services to our current customers only through the expiration of their current agreements 
we may have difficulty replacing the revenue from these customers 
during  we continued to generate revenue from our taleo contingent solution based on a fixed percentage of the dollar amount invoiced for temporary labor charges processed through our time and expense functionality 
effective march  we ceased entering into agreements to provide time and expense processing services for temporary workers and  accordingly  our revenue from such processing services will end 
we are servicing our current customers to which we provide such time and expense processing services through the expiration of their current agreements with us 
fees for time and expense processing through our taleo contingent product declined throughout  however  on an annualized basis such fees were still significant in we expect revenue from time and expense processing for these customers to continue to decline and ultimately end in we may find it difficult to replace the revenue we currently receive from the processing of temporary worker time and expense transactions and our results may be negatively impacted 
we may lose sales opportunities if we do not successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships to sell and deliver our solutions 
we have partnered with a number of business process outsourcing  or bpo  and human resource outsourcing  or hro  providers that resell our staffing solutions as a component of their outsourced human resource services and we intended to partner with more in the future 
if customers or potential customers begin to outsource their talent management functions to bpos or hros that do not resell our solutions  or to bpos or hros that choose to develop their own solutions  our business will be harmed 
in addition  we have relationships with third party consulting firms  system integrators and software and service vendors who provide us with customer referrals  integrate their complementary products with ours  cooperate with us in marketing our products and provide our customers with system implementation or other consulting services 
if we fail to establish new strategic relationships or expand our existing relationships  or should any of these partners fail to work effectively with us or go out of business  our ability to sell our products into new markets and to increase our penetration into existing markets may be impaired 
if we are required to reduce our prices to compete successfully  our margins and operating results could be adversely affected 
the intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to reduce our prices 
if our competitors offer discounts on certain products or services we may be required to lower prices or offer our solutions on less favorable terms to compete successfully 
some of our larger competitors have significantly greater resources than we have and are better able to absorb short term losses 
any such changes would likely reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our competitors may provide bundled product offerings that compete with ours for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could  over time  limit the prices that we can charge for our products or services 
if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the quantity of applications sold  our margins and operating results would be adversely affected 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customer data  customers may curtail or stop their use of our solutions  which would harm our reputation  operating results  and financial condition 
our solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
while we have security measures in place  if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  criminal acts by an employee  malfeasance  or otherwise  and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target 
as a result  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
unless our customers elect to purchase encryption  we do not encrypt data we store for our customers while such data is at rest in the database 
applicable law may require that a security breach involving 
table of contents certain types of unencrypted data be publicly disclosed 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our security measures 
defects or errors in our products could affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products  which would harm our business 
our products may contain defects or errors  which could materially and adversely affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any product defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results 
while we test our products for defects or errors prior to product release  defects or errors have been identified from time to time by our customers and may continue to be identified in the future 
any defects that cause interruptions in the availability or functionality of our solutions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  loss of customers  product liability suits against us  diversion of development and support resources  injury to our reputation  and increased maintenance and warranty costs 
while our software subscription agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that should limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software  such limitations and disclaimers may not be upheld by a court or other tribunal or otherwise protect us from such claims 
we participate in a relatively new and evolving market for talent management software and services  which increases the difficulty of evaluating the effectiveness of our current business strategy and future prospects 
our current business model and prospects for increases in revenue should be considered in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in the evolving talent management market 
because this market is relatively new in comparison to other enterprise software markets  we cannot predict with assurance the future growth rate and size of this market  which  in comparison with the market for all enterprise software applications  is relatively small 
the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we sell our products and services  as well as other factors that are beyond our control  reduce our ability to accurately evaluate our future prospects and to forecast with a high degree of certainty our projected quarterly or annual performance 
if acceptance of the vendor hosted  or on demand  delivery model does not continue to develop  or develops more slowly than we expect  our business may be harmed 
the market for on demand  vendor hosted enterprise software  also called software as a service or saas  is still relatively new in comparison to the market for client server based software 
our customers access and use our software as a web based solution that is hosted by us 
if the preferences of our customers change and our customers require that they host our software themselves  either upon the initiation of a new agreement or upon the renewal of an existing agreement  we would experience a decrease in revenue from hosting fees  and potentially higher costs and greater complexity in providing maintenance and support for our software 
additionally  a very limited number of our customers have the contractual right to elect to host our software themselves prior to the expiration of their subscription agreements with us 
if the number of customers purchasing hosting services from us decreases  we might not be able to decrease our expenses related to hosting infrastructure in the short term 
potential customers may be reluctant or unwilling to allow a vendor to host software or internal data on their behalf for a number of reasons  including security and data privacy concerns 
if such organizations do not recognize the benefits of the on demand delivery model  then the market for our solutions may not develop further  or may develop more slowly than we expect 

table of contents if we fail to manage our hosting infrastructure capacity satisfactorily  our existing customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our solution 
we have experienced significant growth in the number of users  transactions  and data that our hosting infrastructure supports 
failure to address the increasing demands on our hosting infrastructure satisfactorily may result in service outages  delays or disruptions 
for example  we have experienced downtimes within our hosting infrastructure  some of which have been significant  which have prevented customers from using our solutions from time to time 
we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our hosting infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers 
we also maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provisioning of new customer deployments and expansion of existing customer deployments 
the development of new hosting infrastructure to keep pace with expanding storage and processing requirements could be a significant cost to us that we are not able to predict accurately and for which we are not able to budget significantly in advance 
such outlays could raise our cost of goods sold and be detrimental to our financial results 
at the same time  the development of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time 
if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements  our existing customers may experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties  financial liabilities and the loss of customers 
if our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with sales  customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity  which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth 
in addition  we are in the process of bringing to market a performance management product for which we may not be able to accurately predict the number of users  transactions and infrastructure demands 
such a failure could result in system outages for our customers and higher than expected costs to support and maintain our performance management solution  which could negatively affect our reputation and our financial results 
any significant disruption in our computing and communications infrastructure could harm our reputation  result in a loss of customers and adversely affect our business 
our computing and communications infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations 
our customers access our solutions through a standard web browser 
our customers depend on us for fast and reliable access to our applications 
much of our software is proprietary  and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering and software development teams for the continued performance of our applications 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  serious disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure 
factors that may cause such disruptions include human error  physical or electronic security breaches  telecommunications outages from third party providers  computer viruses  acts of terrorism or sabotage  fire  earthquake  flood and other natural disasters  and power loss 
although we back up data stored on our systems at least weekly  our infrastructure does not currently include real time  or near real time  mirroring of data storage and production capacity in more than one geographically distinct location 
thus  in the event of a physical disaster  or certain other failures of our computing infrastructure  customer data from recent transactions may be permanently lost 
we have computing and communications hardware operations located at third party facilities in the united states with internap on the east coast and with equinix on the west coast 
we do not control the operation of these facilities and must rely on these vendors to provide the physical security  facilities management and communications infrastructure services to ensure the reliable and consistent delivery of our solutions to our customers 
although we believe we would be able to enter into a similar relationship with another third party should one of these relationships fail or terminate for any reason  we believe our reliance on any third party vendor exposes us to risks outside of our control 
if these third party vendors encounter financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events 
table of contents beyond our control that cause them to fail to secure adequately and maintain their hosting facilities or provide the required data communications capacity  our customers may experience interruptions in our service or the loss or theft of important customer data 
in the future  we may elect to open computing and communications hardware operations at additional third party facilities located in the united states  europe or other regions 
we are not experienced at operating such facilities in jurisdictions outside the united states and doing so may pose additional risk to us 
we have experienced system failures in the past 
if our customers experience service interruptions or the loss or theft of their data caused by us  we may be required to issue credits pursuant to the terms of our contracts and may also be subject to financial liability or customer losses 
such credits could reduce our revenues below the levels that we have indicated we expect to achieve and adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
we must hire and retain key employees and recruit qualified personnel or our future success and business could be harmed our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees  such as our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer 
if we lose the services of one or more of our senior management or key employees  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise to compete with us  our business could be harmed 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
additionally  our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and other personnel 
further  because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
in particular  because our research and development facilities are primarily located in quebec  canada  we are substantially dependent on that relatively small labor market to attract and retain qualified engineers 
we intend to invest in development centers in other locations but to date our development in operations in locations other than quebec  canada is not substantial 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations outside of north america and expect to expand our international operations 
however  we do not have substantial experience in international markets  and may not achieve the expected results 
during the twelve months ended december   revenue generated outside of north america was of total revenue  based on the location of the legal entity of the customer with which we contracted 
we currently have international offices outside of north america in australia  france  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom  which focus primarily on selling and implementing our solutions in those regions 
however  we currently maintain data centers only in the united states 
in  we plan to continue our research and development operations in quebec  canada and expand our international operations  including opening product development locations and data centers outside of north america 
we may also expand our international sales and services locations 
these initiatives will involve a variety of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  taxes  trade laws  tariffs  export quotas  custom duties or other trade restrictions  differing regulations in quebec with regard to maintaining operations  products and public information in both french and english  differing labor regulations  especially in the european union and quebec  where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the united states  including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations  more stringent regulations relating to data privacy and the unauthorized use of  or access to  commercial and personal information  particularly in europe and canada  
table of contents reluctance to allow personally identifiable data related to non us citizens to be stored in databases within the united states  due to concerns over the united states government s right to access personally identifiable data of non us citizens stored in databases within the united states or other concerns  greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products  greater difficulty in localizing our marketing materials and legal agreements  including translations of these materials into local language  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees or independent contractors over large geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs  limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection  and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner  our business and operating results will suffer 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
we currently have foreign sales denominated in foreign currencies  including the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  the euro  new zealand dollar  singapore dollar and swiss franc and may in the future have sales denominated in the currencies of additional countries in which we establish or have established sales offices 
in addition  we incur a substantial portion of our operating expenses in canadian dollars and  to a much lesser extent  other foreign currencies 
any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
for instance  in  the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the average rates in effect during was a million decrease in earnings 
in  we expect that the volatility in exchange rates for foreign currencies may continue and we could incur additional losses from the impact of such fluctuations 
we have not previously engaged in foreign currency hedging 
if we decide to hedge our foreign currency exposure  we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of experience  unreasonable costs or illiquid markets 
if we fail to defend our proprietary rights aggressively  our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced revenue  and incur costly litigation fees to protect our rights 
our success is dependent  in part  upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we do not have any issued or pending patents and do not rely on patent protection 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries in which we operate 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
to the extent we expand our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase 
we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from developing technologies independently that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
initiating legal action may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 

table of contents current and future litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are sometimes subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  which may seriously harm our business  overall financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future  see note commitments and contingencies in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or a claim that results in a significant award for damages 
software product developers such as us may continue to receive infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our space grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
for example  kenexa  a competitor  filed suit against us for patent infringement in august and other infringement claims have been threatened against us 
we can give no assurance that such claims will not be filed in the future 
our competitors or other third parties may also challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights 
a claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties 
if we were subject to a claim of infringement  regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses  the claim could require costly litigation to resolve and the payment of substantial damages  require significant management time  cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements  require us to discontinue the sale of our products  require us to indemnify our customers or third party service providers  or require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products 
we entered into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business and may be required to indemnify our customers for our own products and third party products that are incorporated into our products and that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
although many of the third parties from which we purchase are obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights of others  this indemnification may not be adequate 
in addition  from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products 
we use open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future 
as a result  we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software 
litigation could be costly for us to defend  have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products 
our insurance policies will not compensate us for any losses or liabilities resulting from patent infringement claims 
we employ technology licensed from third parties for use in or with our solutions  and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs  or reduced service levels  which would adversely affect our business 
we include in the distribution of our solutions certain technology obtained under licenses from other companies  such as oracle for database software  and business objects for reporting software 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology and development tools from third parties in the future 
although we believe that there are commercially reasonable software alternatives to the third party software we currently license  this may not always be the case  or we may license third party software that is more difficult or costly to replace than the third party software we currently license 
in addition  integration of our products with new third party software may require significant work and require substantial allocation of our time and resources 
also  to the extent that our products depend upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products  any undetected errors in these third party products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our 
table of contents products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
our use of additional or alternative third party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties  which could result in higher costs 
difficulties that we may encounter in managing changes in the size of our business could affect our operating results adversely 
in order to manage our business effectively  we must continually manage headcount in an efficient manner 
in the past we have undergone facilities consolidations and headcount reductions in certain locations and departments  and we may do so again 
in such events we may incur charges for employee severance 
as many employees are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states  we are required to pay the severance amounts legally required in such jurisdictions  which may exceed those of the united states 
further  we believe reductions in our workforce and facility consolidation create anxiety and uncertainty  and may adversely affect employee morale 
these measures could adversely affect our employees that we wish to retain and may also adversely affect our ability to hire new personnel 
they may also negatively affect customers 
failure to manage our customer deployments effectively could increase our expenses and cause customer dissatisfaction 
enterprise deployments of our products require a substantial understanding of our customers businesses  and the resulting configuration of our solutions to their business processes and integration with their existing systems 
we may encounter difficulties in managing the timeliness of these deployments and the allocation of personnel and resources by us or our customers 
in certain situations  we also work with third party service providers in the implementation or software integration related services of our solutions  and we may experience difficulties in managing such third parties 
failure to manage customer implementation or software integration related services successfully by us or our third party service providers could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the rate at which new customers purchase our solutions 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in generally accepted accounting principles or changes in our operating history that impact the application of generally accepted accounting principles 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  the sec and various other organizations formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our projected financial results 
pursuant to the application of gaap we recognize the majority of our application revenue monthly over the life of the application agreement 
in certain instances  the straight line revenue recognized on a monthly basis may exceed the amounts invoiced for the same period 
if our history of collecting all fees reflected in our application agreements negatively changes  the application of gaap may mandate that we not recognize revenue in excess of the fees invoiced over the corresponding period for new agreements 
the application of gaap also requires that we accomplish delivery of our solutions to our customers in order to recognize revenue associated with such solutions 
in the context of our model  delivery generally requires the creation of an instance of the solution that may be accessed by the customer via the internet 
we may experience difficulty in making new products available to our customers in this manner 
in the event we are not able to make our solutions available to our customer via the internet in a timely manner  due to resource constraints  implementation difficulties or other reasons  our ability to recognize revenue from the sales of our solutions may be delayed and our financial results may be negatively impacted 
if tax benefits currently available under the tax laws of canada and the province of quebec are reduced or repealed  or if we have taken an incorrect position with respect to tax matters under discussion with the canadian revenue agency or other taxing authorities  our business could suffer 
the majority of our research and development activities are conducted through our canadian subsidiary  taleo canada inc we participate in a government program in quebec that provides investment credits based upon qualifying research and development expenditures 
these expenditures primarily consist of the salaries for the persons conducting research and development activities 
we have participated in the program since  and expect that we 
table of contents will continue to receive these investment tax credits through december in  we recorded a cad million reduction in our research and development expenses as a result of this program 
we anticipate the continued reduction of our research and development expenses through application of these credits through if these investment tax benefits are reduced or eliminated  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition to the research and development investment credit program described above  our canadian subsidiary has applied to participate in a scientific research and experimental development  or sred  program administered by the canadian federal government that provides income tax credits based upon qualifying research and development expenditures  including capital equipment purchases 
in june  we filed our initial sred credit claims with respect to our and tax years and recorded combined credits of cad million and cad million in our canadian subsidiary is eligible to remain in the sred program for future tax years as long as its development projects continue to qualify 
these federal sred tax credits can only be applied to offset federal taxes payable and are reported as a credit to tax provision to the extent they reduce taxes payable to zero with any residual benefits recorded as a net deferred tax asset 
we believe that our canadian subsidiary is in compliance with these government programs and that all amounts recorded will be fully realized 
if these investment credits are reduced or disallowed by the canada revenue agency cra  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
our canadian subsidiary is under examination by the canada revenue agency cra with respect to tax years and we have settled certain issues raised in the audit and are appealing the cra s treatment of quebec investment tax credits 
final resolution of the cra s examination will have bearing on the tax treatment applied in subsequent periods not currently under examination 
we have recorded income tax reserves believed to be sufficient to cover the estimated tax assessments for the open tax periods and have estimated the potential range of additional income  as a result of the quebec investment tax credit  to be between cad million and million 
there could be a significant impact to our uncertain tax position over the next twelve months depending on the outcome of the on going cra audit 
in the event the cra audit results in adjustments that exceed both our income tax reserves and available deferred tax assets  our canadian subsidiary may become a tax paying entity in or in a prior year including potential penalties and interest 
any such penalties cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are seeking united states tax treaty relief through the appropriate competent authority tribunals for the settlements entered into with cra and will seek treaty relief for all subsequent final settlements 
although we believe we have reasonable basis for our tax positions  it is possible an adverse outcome could have a material effect upon our financial condition  operating results or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period 
other foreign tax examinations 
as we continue to expand internationally  we may become subject to review by various foreign taxing authorities which could negatively impact our financial results 
while we have reserved for these uncertainties and do not expect the outcomes of these reviews to be material to our operations  our current assessment as to the potential financial impact of these reviews could prove incorrect and we may incur income tax liability in excess of our current reserves 
evolving regulation of the internet may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts  which may adversely affect our financial condition 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies may become more likely 
we are particularly sensitive to these risks because the internet is a critical component of our business model 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy  and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data  potentially reducing demand for solutions accessed via the internet and restricting our ability to store  process and share data with our customers via the internet 
in addition  taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet based services  which could harm our business 

table of contents if we fail to develop our brand cost effectively  our customers may not recognize our brand and we may incur significant expenses  which would harm our business and financial condition 
we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new customers 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market intensifies 
successful promotion of our brand will depend largely upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful solutions at competitive prices 
in the past  our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense  and we expect to increase that expense in connection with our branding and marketing processes 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue  and even if they do  any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand 
if we fail to promote successfully and maintain our brand  we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand building efforts  and our business could suffer 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could decline 
the stock market in general and the market for technology related stocks in particular has been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our class a common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our class a common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed in this risk factors section and others such as our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  the overall performance of the equity markets  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  publication of unfavorable research reports about us or our industry or withdrawal of research  coverage by securities analysts or lack of coverage by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  general economic conditions and data and the impact of such conditions and data on the equity markets  terrorist acts  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures  or capital commitments 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available  thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate our business 
if we need to raise additional funds due to unforeseen circumstances  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any additional financings could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to meet our business objectives  our stock price may fall and you may lose some or all of your investment 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms  which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting  and will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 

table of contents our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that could significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with or greater stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties our principal offices are in dublin  california  where we lease approximately  square feet of space 
we entered into the dublin lease in march the term of the dublin lease is seven years  commencing on june   and we have one option to renew the lease for an additional term of five years 
over the term  our base rent ranges from approximately  per month to approximately  per month  in addition to operating expenses and taxes

in north america  we have additional sales and services personnel throughout the united states  including offices in chicago and toronto 
outside of north america  we maintain offices for our sales and services personnel in the london area  melbourne  paris  singapore and sydney 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for current needs  though we may open additional sales  services  development and support locations in we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate foreseeable expansion of our operations 
item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in claims  legal proceedings and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
for example  kenexa brassring  inc  filed suit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware for patent infringement on august  kenexa asserts that we have infringed patent numbers and  and seeks monetary damages and an injunction enjoining us from further infringement 
management has reviewed this matter and believes that our software products do not infringe any valid and enforceable claim of these patents 
we have filed an answer to the complaint filed by kenexa brassring  inc  and litigation is proceeding 
other infringement claims have been threatened against us  in the past  see note commitments and contingencies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available information  management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these unresolved matters  individually and in the aggregate  is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
if we should be subject to an unfavorable ruling by a court  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods
