item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
our ability to continue as a going concern our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report dated march  in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of december  that included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements as of december  have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
while we are taking several responsive steps that management believes will be sufficient to allow the company to continue as a going concern as described in footnote no 
to the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the form k  there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective 
if we are not able to continue as a going concern  it is likely that holders of our common stock will lose all of their investment 
o ur financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
company overview we are engaged in the manufacture and distribution of building materials to contractors  subcontractors  building materials dealers and others located primarily in florida  mississippi  georgia  alabama and louisiana and to a lesser extent  other states in the southeastern united states 
we have two manufacturing plants and distribution facilities through which we market our products 
our business is driven primarily by the level of residential and commercial construction activity in the southeast united states  particularly the states of florida  georgia  mississippi  alabama and louisiana 
the level of construction activity is dependent on many factors including  but not limited to  the general state of the economy  credit markets  population growth  inventory of available residential and commercial units  government growth policies and construction funding 
residential and commercial construction activity has slowed significantly since the third quarter of this slowdown has had a negative effect on our net sales and profitability 
industry reports indicate the residential and commercial construction markets are expected to remain soft throughout critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as with all estimates and assumptions  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends as well as its forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue  net of discounts and allowances  at the point of sale or upon delivery to the customer s site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  we recognize revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the aging of the receivables  the payment history of customers and other factors that include changes in general business conditions  such as competitive conditions in the market and deterioration in the economic condition of the construction industry  among other things  which may affect customers ability to pay 
as a result  judgment is required in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods 
however  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional provisions may be required 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method or average cost basis 
the difference between fifo and average cost for certain locations that changed from fifo to average cost in and is immaterial 
we will record provisions  as appropriate  to write down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires us to make judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be able to be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause the actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subseq uent periods 
however  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected 
litigation litigation or other claims made against us are assessed at the end of each reporting period as to their likelihood of the incurrence of a liability 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such action  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement of final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
we accrue legal fees and a loss contingency when we believe a loss  net of insurance  is probable and the amount of loss and legal fees can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have been previously made 
asset impairment our review of long lived assets requires us to initially estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets  whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset  principally determined either by third party appraisals  sales price negotiations or estimated discounted future cash flows  which includes making estimates of the timing of the future cash flows  discount rates and reflecting carrying degrees of perceived risk 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets have been impaired 
however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize a material non cash impairment charge 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the liability method requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal and state income tax returns be recognized in the balance sheet 
we generally do not file our income tax returns until after our consolidated financial statements are complete 
as a result  we use estimates to calculate the tax provision or benefit recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates include  among other things  the appropriate state income tax rates to use in the various states in which our company and its subsidiaries are required to file  the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry forwards for both federal and state income tax purposes and valuation allowances required  if any  for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future 
we believe that the amounts recorded as deferred income tax assets will be recoverable through future taxable income generated by us 
although there can be no assurance that all recognized deferred tax assets will be fully recovered  we believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law 
results of operations year ended december  compared to net sales decreased approximately  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in sales was principally due to the slowdown in the residential and commercial construction markets in our principal trade areas 
this decrease includes a  reduction from locations closed during partially offset by  from a location that opened in historically  applications for building permits for new residential units are considered a strong sign for future construction activity 
these applications have declined sharply in florida during the months ending december  and have declined moderately in our non florida markets 
according to the us census bureau  building permits for the construction of new residential units in florida  our largest market  decreased and for the year and three months ended december   respectively  as compared to the same periods in while building permits for new residential units have increased in the mississippi gulf coast trade area for the year ended december   there was a decrease in building permits in the region for the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in construction activity in the gulf coast markets is expected to remain stronger than the florida market due to continued rebuilding activities in areas impacted by hurricane katrina 
industry reports indicate the residential and commercial construction markets are expected to remain soft throughout gross profit as a percentage of net sales in was approximately  as compared to  for the decrease in gross profit margin is due primarily to increased competition resulting from the decline in construction activity in our markets  partially offset by a greater proportion of sales from our manufactured products which generally have higher margins 
the product sales mix in is not expected to materially change during selling  general and administrative expenses includes the amortization of a previously deferred gain from the sale of certain assets of  for the year ended december  and no such gain in without the offset of this gain  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  for the year ended december  and increased  for the three months ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase of  in bad debt expense  a  increase in facility closure costs  a  increase in professional fees  a  increase in insurance expense  a  increase in depreciation expense and a  increase in computer expense 
these increases were offset by a reduction of  in payroll and related expenses and a  reduction in delivery expenses due to the decline in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was for the year ended december   respectively  compared to for the same period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales is due primarily to the company s relatively high proportion of fixed costs being spread over lower sales volume and an increase in certain operating expenses for the year ended december  a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in nature 
accordingly  operating income is affected materially by fluctuations in net sales 
the decrease in net sales in the year ended december  compared to the same period in had an adverse impact on operating income 
as a result of the above factors we had an operating loss of  for the year ended december   respectively  compared to operating income of  in the same period in interest expense decreased  in  compared to the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates and less debt outstanding during miscellaneous income  net of expenses  decreased  in compared to the decrease was primarily due to recognizing less income from late charge fees generated from past due receivables due to reduced levels of account receivable 
other income without the effect of interest expense and miscellaneous income increased  in compared to the increase is due to the recognition of  of income from the settlement of product liability litigation against dfh in the first quarter of for the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  in the reduction in income tax expense is due primarily to a reduction in taxable income 
as a result of the above factors  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to net income of  or per diluted share for the same period in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of  compared to working capital of  at december  the decrease in working capital was due primarily to a decrease in cash  accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by reductions in accounts payable 
also  the notes payable was reclassified to long term debt due to extension in the maturity date to june these decreases resulted from lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in and our efforts to reduce inventory 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  compared to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of  at december  the decrease is due primarily to a change in banking policies resulting in restricted cash clearing the bank quicker in than in net cash provided by operating activities in was  compared to  in the decrease is due primarily to the operating loss for the year ended compared to partially offset by cash generated from the reduction in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to less investment in property  plant and equipment in compared to net cash used in financing activities in was  compared to  in the increase was due primarily to the reduction in notes payable line of credit in the net amount of  compared to a decrease of  in in  our restricted cash decreased  compared to  in  and we made in payments to our former preferred stockholders in  compared to  last year 
future commitments and funding sources our primary sources of cash are proceeds from sales to customers and our  line of credit 
trade accounts receivable represent amounts due primarily from subcontractors  contractors and building materials dealers located principally in florida  alabama  mississippi  georgia and louisiana that have purchased products on unsecured open accounts from us 
accounts receivable  net of allowance  was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
collections of accounts receivable have slowed during the year and worsened in the fourth quarter of primarily due to the financial difficulties our customers are experiencing  who generally are small to midsize subcontractors  because of the condition of the residential and commercial construction industry 
we continue to vigorously collect past due accounts 
our line of credit provides us with up to  in borrowing capacity and is collateral ized by eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
generally  accounts not collected within days are not eligible under our borrowing agreement 
the line of credit bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus at december  
annualized interest expense based on the outstanding balance of the line of credit would be approximately  at december  the outstanding balance on the line of credit was approximately  and we were eligible to borrow approximately  resulting in excess availability of approximately  if availability on the line of credit falls below  the company must comply with certain restrictive loan covenants 
if the company had been required to comply with the loan covenants in  we would have been in violation as of december  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report dated march  in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of december  that included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements as of december  have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
while we are taking several responsive steps that management believes will be sufficient to allow the company to continue as a going concern as described in footnote no 
to the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the form k 
there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective 
if we are not able to continue as a going concern  it is likely that holders of our common stock will lose all of their investment 
o ur financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
in december  the company approved a plan merging it into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company effective december  the merger as a result of the consummation of the merger with its wholly owned subsidiary  we agreed to pay  in cash to our former preferred stockholders 
at december   we had paid  of such cash amount 
amounts payable to such stockholders at december  results from the former preferred stockholders non compliance with the conditions for payment 
also  we have paid the holders of debentures  which were issued in connection with the merger  an aggregate of  amounts payable to stockholders at december  on our consolidated balance sheet includes  payable to former debenture holders who have not yet tendered their debentures as required by the terms of such merger 
we presently are focusing our efforts on expanding our product offerings marketed through our existing distribution facilities and our new facility recently opened in new orleans  louisiana  enhancing customer service  increasing market share by expanding our outside sales staff to generate additional sales and improving working capital 
we expect to incur various capital expenditures necessary to carry the new product lines aggregating approximately  we expect to finance approximately  of these expenditures from various lenders with the balance funded by our line of credit 
however there is no assurance we will be able to obtain the financing or if we do  whether the financing will be available on acceptable terms 
in  we initiated a plan to convert to a new company wide network infrastructure and new accounting software 
this system is a fully integrated enterprise resource planning system which will support management decision making in an effort to more efficiently service our customers 
the initial scope of the project was expected to cost approximately  of which approximately  was financed by a commercial lender in the first quarter of and recorded as long term debt 
as of december   we have capitalized  of costs related to this conversion 
rollout of this new system began in july  and resulted in an increase in operating expense of  for the six months ended december  and approximately  for the year ended december  depreciation expense was  and  for the year ended december  and the six months ended december   respectively 
such operating expenses are expected to continue at approximately the same rate into the ongoing future 
we entered into an agreement with a communications company to provide a wide area network and other various services for approximately  per month for a month period beginning in april we opened distribution facilities in mobile  alabama in february  in brooksville  florida in august  in ocala  florida in march and in new orleans  louisiana in february due primarily to the decline in the construction industry  we permanently closed distribution facilities in st 
augustine  florida  brooksville  florida and ocala  florida in december resulting in accrued closure costs of  recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities and selling  general and administrative expenses at december  we are now required to comply with the requirements in section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox for the year ending december  implementation of sox during cost approximately  in direct consulting fees and an undetermined amount of internal resources 
we expect to incur higher costs in as that incurred in for sox compliance 
beginning march   we were forced to renew our products liability coverage with an exclusion for eifs exposure 
due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of litigation  there can be no assurances as to when or if any future uninsured claims may be filed  and if they are  to not be material 
while we do not believe the outstanding insured eifs claims against dfh will have a material effect on our financial position  there can be no assurance of this because of the uncertainty of litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
in connection with the basf sales agreement  we ceased manufacturing operations at our kennesaw  georgia facility in the fourth quarter of ceasing manufacture of dfh products for which we were not able to obtain insurance for eifs exposure reduces our litigation risk for that product line in the future 
in addition  as part of the basf sales agreement  just rite entered into a distribution agreement with basf  in which basf has agreed to indemnify just rite against any product liability claims for products manufactured by basf and sold through just rite 
management is taking several steps to improve our operating results and financial conditions 
these steps include closure of three underperforming distribution facilities location in st 
augustine  brooksville and ocala  florida  implementation of cost reduction initiatives to reduce unnecessary costs in our operations and to conserve working capital  implementation of more stringent credit and collection procedures and controls in an attempt to reduce days outstanding of trade accounts receivable and improve working capital 
based upon the steps outlined above being successful  we believe our cash on hand and the maintenance of our borrowing arrangement with our commercial lender will provide sufficient cash to meet current obligations for our operations and support the cash requirements of our capital expenditure programs during the next year 
we also plan to obtain additional financing through refinancing of existing mortgage indebtedness on company real properties to take advantage of the significant equity available in excess of the amount of our existing mortgage debt  and financing from other sources  including the possibility of refinancing equipment  or the sale of equity  to generate additional funds for operations and to take advantage of lower interest rates 
there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available or that we could obtain any such financing on terms suitable to us 
our ability to maintain and improve our long term liquidity is primarily dependent on our ability to successfully achieve profitable operations  obtain additional financing and resolve litigation on terms favorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  competition  loss of significant customers  customers inability to make required payments  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  changes in accounting rules and requirements  and other governmental regulations and restrictions 
our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
see part i  item a  risk factors and risk factors in our filings with the securities and exchange commission for additional information of our financial exposures 
market risks residential and commercial construction activity our sales depend heavily on the strength of residential and commercial construction activity in the southeastern united states 
the strength of these markets depends on many factors beyond our control 
some of these factors include interest rates  employment levels  availability of credit  supply of unsold residential housing units  real estate prices  weather conditions  and availability of raw materials and products purchased for resale  as well as consumer confidence 
downturns in the market that we serve or in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among building materials suppliers  which may adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
our first quarter revenues and  to a lesser extent  our fourth quarter revenues are somewhat adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
weather conditions such as heavy rain or snow  will generally preclude customers from installing our products on job sites 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our profits and operating results also tend to be lower and less favorable during the first and fourth quarters 
exposure to interest rates a majority of our debt bears interest at rates that vary with changes in market indexes 
at december   we had aggregate variable rate mortgage notes of  maturing at various dates from march to april the mortgages bear interest at variable rates related to changes in prime  or the day libor rates of interest 
in addition  our  line of credit from a commercial lender bears an interest rate of day libor plus effective march a significant increase in the market index rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  future increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on residential and commercial construction activity and demand for the sale of our products 
if the interest rate increased or decreased  interest expense would increase or decrease approximately  based on the outst anding balance at december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment  which amends sab  share based payment  to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to use the simplified method in sab for employee option grants after december  use of the simplified method after december is permitted only for companies whose historical data about their employees exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for employee option grants as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
sab is effective for employee options granted after december  we intend to adopt sab effective january  and continue applying the simplified method until enough historical experience is readily available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for employee option grants

a consolidation the consolidated financial statements contain the accounts of imperial and its wholly owned subsidiaries  premix  just rite  dfh and triple i leasing  inc all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
b concentration of credit risk concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer base 
we perform credit evaluations on customers prior to extending credit 
trade accounts receivable are generally unsecured open accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is considered sufficient to absorb any losses which may arise from uncollectible accounts receivable 
at december  and  we had no significant concentrations of credit risk 
we place our cash with commercial banks 
at december   we had cash balances with banks in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits 
management believes the credit risk related to these deposits to be minimal 
c allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance of doubtful accounts is evaluated monthly and is based on the collectability of customer accounts and the aging of customer invoices 
many factors are considered in evaluating collectability including  but not limited to  payment history  current economic condition and an assessment of our lien and bond rights for certain jobs 
the company reviews its accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to identify slow paying or problem customers 
we recognize bad debt expense using the allowance method 
d inventories and rebates inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out fifo or average cost basis 
finished goods include the cost of raw materials  freight in  direct labor and plant overhead

just rite has an arrangement with a buying group and certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates vendor rebates based principally upon achievement of certain volume purchasing levels during the year 
just rite accrues the estimated receipt of vendor rebates as a reduction of the cost of inventory purchases based on progress towards earning the vendor rebates taking into consideration cumulative purchases throughout the year

r sfas r  share based payment  on january  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas r superseded our previous accounting methodology described below 
prior to january   we measured compensation expense related to granting stock options and stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method  under which compensation expense  if any  was generally based on the difference between the exercise price of an option  or the amount paid for an award  and the market price or fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of the award 
because our policy is to grant employee stock options at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the company s stock at the date of grant  we have not recognized compensation expense for our employee stock options prior to january  l use of estimates management uses estimates and assumptions relating to reporting assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the recording of revenues and expenses to prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from those estimates

we accrue legal fees and a loss contingency when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss and legal fees can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that have been previously made

s impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the total by which the carrying amounts of the assets  if any  exceed the fair values determined using a discounted cash flow model

commitments and contingencies a contingencies legal proceedings eifs claims our subsidiary dfh f k a acrocrete  together in two instances with affiliates of dfh and in all instances with non affiliated parties  are defendants in thirteen lawsuits pending in various southeastern states  brought by homeowners  homeowners associations  contractors and subcontractors  claiming moisture intrusion damage as a result of the use of exterior insulation finish wall systems eifs  on single and multi family residences 
our insurance carriers are providing a defense and have accepted coverage under a reservation of rights for nine of these claims and are providing a defense in one other case  for which dfh expects its carriers will eventually accept coverage 
with respect to three claims  the insurance carrier has been placed on notice and is expected to accept coverage and pay all defense and indemnity costs once the self insured retention has been exhausted 
in a former eifs claim  dfh was a defendant in a lawsuit styled anthony derck and mary derck v 
stalnaker construction  inc et al 
v 
atrium aluminum production and acrocrete  inc in the circuit court of the first judicial circuit in and for walton county  florida  case no 
ca 
the lawsuit involved claims by plaintiffs against dfh for moisture damages allegedly caused by dfh s eifs products 
a jury trial resulted in a judgment against dfh for  which was reduced to  by the trial court and was eventually reversed on appeal and remanded for a new final hearing 
on april   dfh and the dercks settled the matter for  dfh paid  and our insurance carrier agreed to pay the balance 
in connection with the settlement  it was agreed that all pending litigation between the company and our insurance carrier relating to this matter would be dropped 
as a result of this settlement  we reversed a portion of the accrual established for this matter resulting in a gain on litigation settlement of  in the first quarter of nine of the more recent eifs claims that have been filed against dfh  six of which have subsequently been settled  are subject to insurance policies that have  self insured retention requirements sir that did not exist in previous insurance policies with other carriers 
pursuant to the sir requirement  dfh is required to make payments towards either the defense or indemnity of these claims  including but not limited to the payment of attorneys fees  costs and settlement payments up to the sir limit 
once the sir limit has been satisfied  the applicable insurance carrier is required to defend and indemnify dfh 
any additional costs that are incurred  whether in the form of defense or indemnity payments  are thereafter the sole responsibility of the insurance carrier up to policy limits 
of the three remaining eifs cases described above  dfh s applicable insurance carrier is expected to accept coverage and is expected to pay all defense and indemnity costs once the sir has been exhausted 
notwithstanding acceptance of such coverage  we believe that all three claims are covered by insurance policies issued by another carrier which do not contain an sir this prior insurance carrier has initially denied coverage 
accordingly  on march   dfh filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment against such insurer in florida state court regarding one of these three remaining eifs cases 
dfh has requested that the court declare as a matter of law that dfh s prior insurer has a duty to defend and indemnify dfh in this eifs case  as well as reimburse dfh for all attorney s fees and costs it has incurred as a result of the insurer s denial of coverage 
imperial industries  inc 
and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued commitments and contingencies continued the allegations of defects in eifs are not restricted to dfh products used in an eifs application  but rather are an industry wide issue 
the alleged failure of these products to perform has generally been linked to improper application and the failure of adjacent building materials such as windows  roof flashing  decking and the lack of caulking 
as insurance markets for moisture intrusion type coverage have all but disappeared  we were forced on march  to renew our existing products liability coverage with an exclusion for eifs exposure 
however  dfh has made a concerted effort to limit its exposure in any such future eifs claims 
for example  dfh instructed its salesmen and independent distributors not to sell acrylic stucco products for eifs applications to end users in the residential construction market and eliminated warranties of acrylic stucco products used in such applications 
in addition  we no longer manufacture such products following the closure of the dfh manufacturing facility in kennesaw  georgia in the fourth quarter of  further reducing future exposure to eifs claims 
following the closure of the dfh manufacturing facility  just rite became a distributor of acrylic stucco products manufactured by degussa now basf under the acrocrete brand 
as par t of the distribution agreement  degussa has agreed to indemnify just rite for any product liability claims for such products 
to date  dfh has not experienced any eifs claims for any periods that would not be covered by insurance 
due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of litigation  there can be no assurance as to when  or if  any future uninsured claims may be filed  and if they were  to not be material 
history of claims historically  there have been over resolved eifs claims involving dfh 
the average settlement  together with legal fees and expenses in these eifs claims was approximately  with the exception of the derck case above  and two other claims where dfh contributed an aggregate of approximately  dfh s applicable insurance carriers have borne complete responsibility for all amounts and dfh has not had to contribute any cash in connection with the settlement of the resolved eifs claims not subject to sir limits 
dfh s administrative costs associated with the resolved eifs claims were not material and there was no material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
we have no reason to believe that  based on such historical experience  the pending eifs claims which are not subject to sir limits  will not be similarly resolved and no accrual can reasonably be estimated 
the estimated exposure could range from to some undetermined amount 
management has evaluated the pending eifs claims and  because of the uncertainty of the ultimate settlement of these cases  which may or may not require payment  management does not believe that a reliable estimate of the loss can be made within the above range and therefore  a loss contingency has not been recorded for any of these claims 
any losses and expenses in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
based on the pending eifs claims that are possibly subject to sir requirements contained in the underlying insurance policies with one of its insurance carriers  we have established a loss contingency of approximately  which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities at december  due to the uncertainty of litigation  loss contingency estimates will continue to be adjusted in future periods based upon the resolution of claims and reported claims  when applicable 
general dfh and premix are engaged in other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business  including three claims against premix one of which includes imperial as a defendant and non affiliated parties which allege bodily injury due to exposure to asbestos contained in products manufactured in excess of thirty years ago 
we believe that premix and the company have meritorious defenses to such claims
