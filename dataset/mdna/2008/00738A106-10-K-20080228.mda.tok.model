item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  manufactures  markets and services network access solutions for communications networks 
our solutions are widely deployed by providers of telecommunications services serviced by our carrier networks division  and small and mid sized businesses and enterprises serviced by our enterprise networks division  and enable voice  data  video and internet communications across copper  fiber and wireless networks 
many of these solutions are currently in use by every major united states service provider and many global ones  as well as by many public  private and governmental organizations worldwide 
our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and or improve gross margins 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
in january  we announced we would begin reporting new product categories in order to increase transparency in major product areas 
the new product categories are loop access carrier systems business networking 
loop access products are used by carrier and enterprise customers for access to today s copper based telecommunications network 
the loop access category includes products such as digital data service dds and integrated services digital network isdn total reach products  high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl products including total access based hdsl and time division multiplex symmetrical hdsl tdm shdsl products  t e t  channel service units data service units csus dsus  and tracer fixed wireless products 
carrier systems products are used by telecommunications service providers to provide last mile access in support of data  voice and video services to consumers and enterprises 
the carrier systems category includes our broadband access products comprising digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam products  total access multi access and aggregation platform products  and fiber to the node fttn products 
our broadband access products are used by service providers to deliver high speed internet access  voice over internet protocol voip  iptv  and or ethernet services from central office or remote terminal locations to customer premises 
the carrier systems category also includes our optical access products 
these products consist of optical access multiplexers including our family of opti products 
optical access products are used to deliver higher bandwidth services  or to aggregate large numbers of low bandwidth services for transportation across fiber optic infrastructure 
total access systems  concentrator products  m multiplexer products and wireless network backhaul products are also included in the carrier systems product category 
business networking products provide enterprises access to today s telecommunication networks and facilitate networking capabilities for voice  data and video networks 
the business networking category includes integrated access devices iad and internetworking products 
internetworking products consists of our netvanta product lines  including ip access routers  ethernet switches  internet security firewall appliances  ip private branch exchange pbx products  carrier ethernet network terminating equipment nte and ip business gateways 
additionally  we are providing subcategory product revenues for our primary growth areas of broadband access  optical access and internetworking products  as well as subcategory product revenues for hdsl and all other products 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for further information regarding these product categories 
sales were million in compared to million in and million in while our total revenues for were slightly above those of  total revenues in our three primary growth product areas  including broadband access  optical 
table of contents access and internetworking  were substantially higher for compared to our gross profit margin improved in to from in  while our operating income margin decreased to in from in  mainly due to an increase of million in spending for research and development efforts primarily related to customer specific product development activities 
net income was million in compared to million in and million in earnings per share  assuming dilution  were in compared to in and in the results for included a benefit of million in provision for income taxes primarily relating to closure of tax audits from prior years and also included a one time  pre tax life insurance benefit of million 
these two items increased earnings per share  assuming dilution  by approximately in earnings per share in  and reflect the repurchase of million  million and million shares of our stock  respectively 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we normally operate with very little order backlog 
the majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
also  not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements which may impact our operating results in a given quarter 
our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of risks associated with our operating results  see item a of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any rebates or discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed or determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the terms of each respective contract where applicable  or under our standard shipping terms for purchase orders accepted without a contract  generally fob shipping point 
in the case of consigned inventory  revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
when contracts contain multiple elements  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element contract should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we record revenue associated with installation services when the installation and all contractual obligations are complete 
when contracts include both installation and product sales  the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item 
either the purchaser  adtran  or a third party can perform installation of our products 
revenues related to maintenance services are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
the majority of enterprise networks products are sold in the united states through a non exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors 
these organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value added resellers and system integrators 
value added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel 
table of contents partner  or they may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion 
additionally  with certain limitations  our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock balancing purposes when these returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
prior to issuing payment terms to a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on at least a quarterly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period  therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is principal preservation and total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
these objectives are achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income securities  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
for each of the years ended december  and  we had a charge of million related to the impairment of certain publicly traded equity securities 
there were no such charges in actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for more information about our investments 
we also invest in privately held entities and private equity funds and record these investments at cost 
we review these investments periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 

table of contents for purposes of determining estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payments  sfas r  we use the black scholes model 
this model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
because our stock based payment awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock based payment awards 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and we use different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
for both and  the valuation allowance was million 
this valuation allowance is included in non current deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects 
we accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products 
these products will require more warranty repairs to be completed at the installed location due to their size and complexity  rather than at a manufacturing site or repair depot 
this field service obligation  as well as the increasing complexity of our products  will cause warranty incidences  when they arise  to be more costly 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  material usage  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty expense 
alternatively  if we provide for more reserves than we require  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

table of contents compared to sales adtran s sales increased from million in to million in this increase in sales is primarily attributable to a million increase in sales of our carrier systems products 
carrier systems product sales increased primarily due to a million increase in optical access product sales  resulting from market share gains across a broad range of customers  and also due to a million increase in broadband access product sales  primarily attributable to new business with a tier latin american carrier and continuing bandwidth upgrades domestically 
partially offsetting these increases in carrier system product sales were decreases in tdm and other traditional product sales as customers shifted emphasis to newer technologies 
many of these newer technologies are integral to our broadband access and optical access product areas 
business networking product sales increased million in compared to due to a million increase in internetworking product sales  driven by the strong performance of the netvanta and ip business gateway product categories and as a result of our efforts to improve our focus on addressing traditional enterprise channels and leveraging our carrier distribution channels 
largely offsetting this increase in internetworking product sales was a decline in traditional iad product sales as customers shifted emphasis to newer technologies 
many of these newer technologies are integral to our internetworking product area 
loop access product sales decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decline in enterprise t product sales 
carrier networks sales increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in optical access and broadband access product sales  partially offset by declines in tdm product sales 
enterprise networks sales increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in internetworking product sales  partially offset by a decrease in traditional iad and enterprise t product sales 
international sales  which are included in the carrier networks and enterprise networks amounts discussed above  increased from million in to million in international sales  as a percentage of total sales  increased from in to in international sales increased primarily due to new business with a tier latin american carrier as well as improved sales to our european and australian customer base

carrier networks cost of sales  as a percent of division sales  was in compared to in enterprise networks cost of sales  as a percent of division sales  was in compared to in an important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved 
this strategy sometimes results in variations in our gross profit margin due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices 
in view of the rapid pace of new product introductions by our company  this strategy may result in variations in gross profit margins that  for any particular financial period  can be difficult to predict 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  and represented of sales for both periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for administration  finance  information systems  human resources  sales and marketing and general management  as well as rent  utilities  legal and accounting expenses  bad debt expense  advertising  promotional material  gains or losses on the disposal of property  plant  and equipment occurring in the normal course of business  trade show expenses  and related travel costs

research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues during the periods being compared 
adtran expects to continue to incur research and development expenses in connection with its new and existing products and its expansion into international markets 
adtran continually evaluates new product opportunities and engages in intensive research and product development efforts which provides for new product development  enhancement of existing products and product cost reductions 
adtran expenses all product research and development costs as incurred 
as a result  adtran may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group or market expansion 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased from million in to million in this decrease is primarily related to a reduction in our cash and marketable securities balances  as a result of stock repurchases 
interest expense interest expense remained constant at million in and see liquidity and capital resources below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
net realized investment gains net realized investment gains decreased from million in to million in the change is primarily a result of the sale of securities associated with the realignment of our investment portfolios  which took place in other income other income  net  comprised primarily of miscellaneous income  gains and losses on foreign currency translations  investment account management fees and scrap raw material sales  increased from million in to million in life insurance proceeds we realized a non recurring gain on life insurance proceeds of million during the first quarter of as a result of the death of our co founder and then chairman of the board  mark smith

table of contents compared to sales adtran s sales decreased from million in to million in the decrease in sales is primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales of our loop access products and a million decrease in sales of our carrier systems products 
loop access product sales decreased due to a decline in hdsl product revenues and enterprise t product revenues  as well variances in revenues of several other less significant products 
carrier systems product sales decreased primarily due to a decline in tdm product revenues and a smaller decline in optical access product revenues  partially offset by an increase in broadband product revenues  as well as variances in revenues of several other less significant products 
partially offsetting these declines in sales was a million increase in business networking product sales 
business networking product sales increased primarily due to a million increase in internetworking product revenues  largely offset by a decline in traditional iad product revenues as well as declines in revenues of several other less significant traditional products 
carrier network sales decreased from million to million in the decrease is the result of lower tdm  hdsl and optical access product revenues  partially offset by an increase in domestic broadband product revenues 
sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in international sales primarily attributable to a major carrier s completion of a new network build out of a particular service in and decreases in spending by some larger domestic carriers 
enterprise networks sales decreased from million in to million in the decrease in enterprise networks sales is primarily related to decreases in enterprise t product revenues and traditional iad product revenues  partially offset by an increase in internetworking product revenues  driven by the strong performance of the netvanta product category 
within the enterprise t product category  the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus  which are hardware units that terminate carrier services at the enterprise location  into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu 
the decrease in traditional iad product revenues is primarily related to a decline in average selling prices due to the consolidation of the clec market 
international sales  which are included in the carrier networks and enterprise networks amounts discussed above  decreased from million in to million in the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to a major customer s completion in of the initial phase of a new network build out of a particular service

research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues during the periods being compared 
we continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts 
we frequently invest heavily in up front new product development efforts prior to the actual commencement of sales of a major new product 
to date  we have expensed all product research and development costs as incurred 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group 
we incurred research and development expenses in connection with new products and expansion into international markets 
in the challenging industry environment in which we operate  we maintained our level of investment in research and development during a period when many competitors have significantly reduced their investments in this area 
this investment has provided for continued new product development  enhancement of current products  and product cost reductions 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily related to higher interest rates earned on our fixed income securities  partially offset by lower investment balances due to cash used to repurchase our stock 
interest expense interest expense remained constant at million in and see liquidity and capital resources below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
net realized investment gains net realized investment gains decreased from million in to million in these gains primarily result from the sale of securities associated with the realignment of our investment portfolio

this contingency was resolved in as accrued 
income taxes although our effective tax rate remained relatively constant at in compared to in  there were fluctuations in the components of the rate 
an increase in tax exempt income resulted in a percentage point decrease in the current year effective rate 
this was substantially offset by the affect of an increase in stock based compensation expense relating to the implementation of sfas r  and an increase in the rate relating to provisions for state income taxes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   cash on hand was million and short term investments were million  which placed our short term liquidity at million 
at december   our cash on hand of million and short term investments of million placed our short term liquidity at million 
the increase in liquidity from to is primarily due to the liquidation of long term investments that were liquidated primarily to fund our share repurchase program 
operating activities our working capital  which consists of current assets less current liabilities  increased from million as of december  to million as of december  the quick ratio  defined as cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and net accounts receivable  divided by current liabilities  increased from as of december  to as of december  the current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  increased from as of december  to as of december  these liquidity ratios will fluctuate as revenues fluctuate and as our inventory  accounts receivable and income tax position change 
the increases in each of these ratios from to are mainly due to an increase in cash and short term investments resulting primarily from the liquidation of long term investments 
long term investments were liquidated in primarily to fund our share repurchase program 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  our allowance for doubtful accounts has declined from million at december  to million at december  quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso increased from days as of december  to days as of december  the increase in accounts receivable and dso at december  is primarily due to the timing of shipments to a large latin american customer in the fourth quarter 
other receivables decreased million from december  to december   primarily resulting from timing and fluctuations in quantities of product sub components supplied to our subcontractors  and their subsequent payments 
during  we adopted direct subcontractor sourcing of many components previously supplied through us to promote production efficiency and lower costs 
fourth quarter inventory turnover increased from turns as of december  to turns as of december  inventory decreased from december  to december  reflecting our efforts during to adopt leaner manufacturing processes to reduce average product manufacturing cycle times and lower on hand inventory requirements 
inventory levels will fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times while guarding against the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand 
accounts payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decline at december  was primarily attributable to the timing of receipt and subsequent payment for finished product assemblies manufactured by our subcontractors 
generally  the change in accounts payable is due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies  inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases 
accrued expenses were million at december  and december  at december   we had an income tax payable of million primarily related to current year taxable income 
at december   we had an income tax receivable of million primarily related to overpayment of estimated taxes  as a result of the benefit received from the passing of legislation late in the year for retroactive federal research and development tax credits 
we receive an income tax deduction for the difference between the exercise price of an option and the market price of the underlying common stock upon exercise of non qualified stock options or disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired upon exercise of incentive stock options by our employees 
we recorded million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  as an income tax deduction in connection with these exercises and disqualifying dispositions 
investing activities capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware  software and manufacturing and test equipment 

table of contents our combined short term and long term investments decreased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily reflecting the impact of our treasury share repurchase program 
during  we managed our investments to shorter maturities because of conditions affecting the financial markets 
we invest all available cash not required for immediate use in operations primarily in securities that we believe bear minimal risk of loss 
at december   these investments included municipal variable rate demand notes of million  municipal auction rate securities of million and municipal fixed rate bonds of million 
at december   the average credit rating on our municipal variable rate demand notes was vmig  on our municipal auction rate securities was aaa and on our municipal fixed rate bonds was aa 
the combination of our municipal fixed rate bonds  municipal variable rate demand notes and municipal auction rate securities had an average duration of years at december  we were not required to impair any of these investments during at december   our outstanding investments included municipal auction rate securities of million and municipal fixed rate bonds of million 
our municipal variable rate demand notes and municipal auction rate securities are classified as available for sale short term investments 
despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  we believe that we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities 
our investments in these securities are recorded at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every seven  or days 
as a result  we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from these investments 
all income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income 
further  we have not been required to record any losses relating to municipal variable rate demand notes or municipal auction rate securities subsequent to december   and we have held no municipal auction rate securities since february  our long term investments decreased from million at december  to million at december  municipal fixed rate bonds classified as long term investments decreased million from million at december  to million at december  long term investments at december  and include an investment in a certificate of deposit of million and million  respectively  which serves as collateral for our revenue bonds  as discussed below 
we have various equity investments included in long term investments at a cost of million and million  and with a fair value of million and million  at december  and  respectively 
of the gross unrealized gains included in these fair market values  a single security carries million and million of this gain at december  and  respectively  and this particular security is thinly traded on a european stock exchange 
long term investments at december  and also include million and million  respectively  related to our deferred compensation plan 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
for each of the years ended december  and we had a charge of million related to the impairment of certain publicly traded equity securities 
there were no such charges in financing activities fifty million dollars of the expansion of phase iii of our corporate headquarters was approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the alabama state industrial development authority the authority
