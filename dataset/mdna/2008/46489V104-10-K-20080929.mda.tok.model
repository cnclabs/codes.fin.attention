item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates past judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  accrued liabilities  and contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
short term investments the company invests certain excess cash in marketable securities consisting primarily of commercial paper  auction rate securities  and money market funds 
the company classifies all debt securities as available for sale and records the debt securities at fair value with unrealized gains and temporary unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity  if material 
declines in fair values that are considered other than temporary are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management of the company expects to collect from outstanding balances 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on management s judgment  considering historical write offs  collections and current credit conditions 
balances which remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a credit to the applicable accounts receivable 
payments received subsequent to the time that an account is written off are considered bad debt recoveries 
inventory inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market 
cost of raw materials is determined using the weighted average method 
cost of work in process and finished goods is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
as the company has operated at a gross loss throughout the past fiscal years  inventories have generally been recorded at market or net realizable value 
fixed assets fixed assets are capitalized and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives production equipment to years office equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years leasehold improvements and capital lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset 
the company has adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that an impairment loss be recognized when the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to result from the use of an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the estimated fair value of the asset if the asset is expected to be held and used 

table of contents management of the company periodically reviews the net carrying value of all of its equipment on an asset by asset basis 
these reviews consider the net realizable value of each asset  as measured in accordance with the preceding paragraph  to determine whether an impairment in value has occurred  and the need for any asset impairment write down 
although management has made its best estimate of the factors that affect the carrying value based on current conditions  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from its assets  and necessitate asset impairment write downs 
deferred financing costs financing costs related to the acquisition of debt are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method 
deferred financing costs include the fair value of common shares issued to certain shareholders for their guarantee of certain company debt in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interest on receivables and payables and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 classification of debt issue costs in the statement of cash flows 
the value of the shares issued was the estimated market price of the shares as of the date of issuance 
amortization of deferred financing costs  totaling  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  is included in financing expense on the statements of operations 
licenses amortization of licenses is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
in fiscal year  the company entered into an agreement with ibt  sa  a belgian company ibt to use ibt s proprietary ink jet production process and its proprietary polymer seed technology for use in brachytherapy procedures using cesium cs 
the company paid license fees of  and  during fiscal years and  respectively  and is amortizing the license over the year term of the license agreement 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reviewed the carrying values of licenses 
although the company has not currently integrated this technology into its products  management will reevaluate the potential of this technology during fiscal year after the company has further improved its current processes 
therefore  the company did not believe that any impairment had occurred to this intangible asset 
amortization of licenses was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
based on the licenses recorded at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for   for   for   for   for  and  thereafter 
other assets other assets  which include deferred charges and patents  are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization 
amortization of patents is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying values of patents and any impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows to be derived from such assets are less than their carrying value 
based on the patents and other intangible assets recorded in other assets at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for   for   for   for   for  and  thereafter 

table of contents asset retirement obligation sfas no 
 asset retirement obligations  establishes standards for the recognition  measurement and disclosure of legal obligations associated with the costs to retire long lived assets 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 the fair value of the future retirement costs of the company s leased assets are recorded as a liability on a discounted basis when they are incurred and an equivalent amount is capitalized to property and equipment 
the initial recorded obligation is discounted using the company s credit adjusted risk free rate and is reviewed periodically for changes in the estimated future costs underlying the obligation 
the company amortizes the initial amount capitalized to property and equipment and recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the estimated remaining useful life of the leased assets 
in fiscal year  the company established an initial asset retirement obligation of  which represented the discounted cost of cleanup that the company anticipated it would have to incur at the end of its equipment and property leases in its old production facility 
this amount was determined based on discussions with qualified production personnel and on historical evidence 
during fiscal year  the company reevaluated its obligations based on discussions with the washington department of health and determined that the initial asset retirement obligation should be increased by an additional  during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company removed all radioactive residuals and tenant improvements from its old production facility and returned the facility to the lessor 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of  accrued for this facility but total costs incurred to decommission the facility were  resulting in an additional expense of  that is included in cost of products sold 
the additional expense was mainly due to unanticipated construction costs to return the facility to its previous state 
the company originally believed that the lessor would retain many of the leasehold improvements in the building  but the lessor instead required their removal 
in september  another asset retirement obligation of  was established representing the discounted cost of the company s estimate of the obligations to remove any residual radioactive materials and all leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term at its new production facility 
the estimate was developed by qualified production personnel and the general contractor of the new facility 
the company has reviewed the estimate again based on its experience with decommissioning its old facility and believes that the original estimate continues to be applicable 
during the years ended june  and  the asset retirement obligation changed as follows beginning balance new obligations settlement of existing obligation changes in estimates of existing obligations accretion of discount ending balance because the company does not expect to incur any expenses related to its asset retirement obligations in fiscal year  the entire balance as of june  is classified as a noncurrent liability 
financial instruments the company discloses the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities  recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet  for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than a forced liquidation sale 

table of contents the carrying amounts of financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  notes payable  and capital lease obligations  approximated their fair values at june  and revenue recognition the company applies the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
 which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for the disclosure of revenue recognition policies 
the company recognizes revenue related to product sales when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and was derived solely from sales of the proxcelan cs brachytherapy seed  which is used in the treatment of cancer 
the company recognizes revenue once the product has been shipped to the customer 
prepayments  if any  received from customers prior to the time that products are shipped are recorded as deferred revenue 
in these cases  when the related products are shipped  the amount recorded as deferred revenue is recognized as revenue 
the company accrues for sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
although the company does not have an extensive operating history upon which to develop sales returns estimates  we have used the expertise of our management team  particularly those with extensive industry experience and knowledge  to develop a proper methodology 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes expense for all share based payments at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate fair value for all stock options on the date of grant 
for stock options that vest over time  the company recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
research and development costs research and development costs  including salaries  research materials  administrative expenses and contractor fees  are charged to operations as incurred 
the cost of equipment used in research and development activities which has alternative uses is capitalized as part of fixed assets and not treated as an expense in the period acquired 
depreciation of capitalized equipment used to perform research and development is classified as research and development expense in the year recognized 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  patent rights  environmental matters  and a variety of other matters 
the company is also subject to various local  state  and federal environmental regulations and laws due to the isotopes used to produce the company s product 
as part of normal operations  amounts are expended to ensure that the company is in compliance with these laws and regulations 
while there have been no reportable incidents or compliance issues  the company believes that if it relocates its current production facilities then certain decommissioning expenses will be incurred and has recorded an asset retirement obligation for these expenses 

table of contents the company records contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  the company does not believe any probable legal proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
under this method  the company provides deferred income taxes for temporary differences that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years based on the reporting of certain costs in different periods for financial statement and income tax purposes 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment of the change 
on july   the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no

common stock equivalents  including warrants and options to purchase the company s common stock  are excluded from the calculations when their effect is antidilutive 
at june  and  the calculation of diluted weighted average shares does not include preferred stock  common stock warrants or options that are potentially convertible into common stock as those would be antidilutive due to the company s net loss position

year ended june  compared to year ended june  product sales 
sales for the year ended june  were  compared to sales of  for the year ended june  the increase of  or was due to increased sales volume of the company s proxcelan cs brachytherapy seeds 
during the year ended june  the company sold its cs seeds to different medical centers as compared to centers during the fiscal year ended june  cost of product sales 
cost of product sales were  for the year ended june  which represents an increase of  or compared to cost of product sales of  for the year ended june  the major components of the increase were depreciation  materials  preload expenses  occupancy costs  and expenses related to the transition to the company s new production facility and decommissioning the company s old production facility 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in consulting and shipping expenses 
depreciation increased approximately  due to moving operations into a new production facility and purchasing new production equipment 
this new production facility allowed the company to increase its available capacity by approximately using its current production techniques and should fulfill the company s production needs for the near future 
the cost of materials increased approximately  mainly due to higher sales volumes 
preload expenses increased approximately  due to higher sales volumes and due to the start up costs of the company s internal preload facility 
occupancy costs increased approximately  as the company entered into a lease for a new production facility in march and continued to pay rent on its old production facility through mid december the company also recorded an impairment charge of  in fiscal year for a hot cell that is not currently in use 
the company also experienced increases in cost of product sales expenditures directly related to the new facility that was opened in september to ensure a smooth transition with no missed order shipments  the company ordered an additional  of isotope in september that was not utilized as the removal and transportation of the isotope from the old facility to the new facility presented logistical challenges that made it cost prohibitive 
as part of opening the new facility  the company incurred approximately  of wages and related taxes for personnel to perform equipment set up and validation 
the company also expensed approximately  of production materials and small tools for the new facility  none of which individually exceeded the  threshold the company uses in determining whether to capitalize production equipment 

table of contents the company removed all radioactive residuals and tenant improvements from its old production facility and returned the facility to the lessor 
the company had an asset retirement obligation of  accrued for this facility but total costs incurred to decommission the facility were  resulting in an additional expense of  that is included in cost of products sold 
the additional expense was mainly due to unanticipated construction costs to return the facility to its previous state 
the company originally believed that the lessor would retain many of the leasehold improvements in the building  but instead required their removal 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in consulting expenses as the previous year included costs related to medical physics and equipment design and approximately  in shipping and freight as the company eliminated certain shipping services 
gross loss 
gross loss was  for the year ended june  this represents an increase of  or over the prior year s gross loss of  the increase is due to the increase in production costs more than offsetting the increase in revenues 
however  the company has worked to reduce its production costs over the past six months and is producing its proxcelan cs brachytherapy seeds more efficiently now 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  were  which represents an increase of  or over the research and development expenses of  for the year ended june  although the overall research and development expenses were consistent with the prior year  consulting expenses increased approximately  due to the company s ongoing project to increase the efficiency of isotope production and travel expenses increased approximately  due to work in russia regarding isotope efficiencies 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately  in legal expenses as the company continues to focus on its key patents and trademarks in strategic countries and deemphasized the protection of patents and trademarks in less strategic countries 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  for the year ended june  this represents an increase of  or compared to the year ended june  sales and marketing expenses of  the change is mainly due to increased personnel costs and consulting expenses partially offset by a decrease in conventions and tradeshows 
personnel costs increased approximately  due to higher commissions paid on increased revenues and an increase in the average headcount 
consulting expenses increased approximately  mainly due to payments to consultants to develop technical publications and other materials  to represent the company at professional society meetings  to serve as members of the company s cesium advisory group  and increased expenses for a lobbying group 
conventions and tradeshows decreased approximately  as the company has reduced its budgets for many of the tradeshows  particularly the smaller tradeshows 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were  compared to general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended june  the decrease of  or is primarily due to a decrease in share based compensation  personnel costs  and travel 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses 
share based compensation decreased approximately million due to reduced option awards in fiscal year and the reversal of expense for unvested and forfeited options for roger girard  the former ceo 
personnel costs decreased approximately  mainly due to the resignation of mr 
girard in february travel decreased approximately  legal expenses increased approximately  due to costs to draft contracts regarding the company s interest in uraldial  llc  a new russian entity  the ibt strategic global alliance agreements  and mediation costs related to negotiations to settle a dispute with the lawrence family trust 

table of contents operating loss 
the company continues to focus its resources on marketing and sales and retaining the administrative infrastructure to increase the level of demand for the company s product 
these costs  coupled with product revenues not covering production costs  and significant research and development expenditures  have resulted in operating losses since its inception 
for the year ended june   the company had an operating loss of  which is a decrease of  or below the operating loss of  for the year ended june  interest and investment income 
interest and investment income was  for the year ended june  compared to interest income of  for the year ended june  interest and investment income is mainly derived from excess funds held in money market and investment accounts 
the increase of  or was due to the higher average cash and short term investment balances during the year ended june  partially offset by decreasing interest rates 
loss on short term investments 
the loss of  for the year ended june  is due to the recent uncertainties in the credit markets particularly for certain auction rate securities held by the company 
the loss represents the amount to write down these securities to their estimated fair market value 
the company has recognized these losses as other than temporary and recorded them in the statement of operations rather than in other comprehensive income as the company may need access to these funds before the uncertainties in the credit markets are fully resolved 
financing expense 
financing expense for the year ended june  was  or a decrease of  or compared to financing expense of  for the year ended june  included in financing expense is interest expense of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources 
we have historically financed our operations through the sale of common stock and related warrants 
during fiscal year  the company s primary source of cash was the exercise of common stock warrants and options for  and the company used existing cash reserves to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of approximately  cash used by operating activities is net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities in  the company invested its excess cash generated from shareholder investments 
during  the company purchased approximately million of various short term investments mainly commercial paper and municipal auction rate securities and sold approximately million of short term investments 
as of june   short term investments held by the company amounted to approximately million 

table of contents cash expenditures for fixed assets were approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase is mainly due to construction to complete our new production facility and equipment purchases for the new facility 
cash flows from financing activities the company issued  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of common stock options and warrants 
the company received  in cash pursuant to these exercises 
projected liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and cash equivalents amounted to  and short term investments amounted to  compared to  of cash and cash equivalents and  of short term investments at june  the company had approximately million of cash and million of short term investments as of september  as of that date management believed that the company s monthly required cash operating expenditures were approximately  management believes that approximately  to  will be spent on capital expenditures during fiscal year  but there is no assurance that unanticipated needs for capital equipment may not arise 
if the company is able to complete its major research and development project to develop a proprietary separation process to manufacture enriched barium  this process should improve isotope production efficiency during fiscal year regardless of whether the company is ultimately successful in developing this process  the remaining project costs are anticipated to be approximately  during fiscal year  the company intends to continue its existing protocol studies and is currently budgeting approximately  for protocol expense in fiscal year assuming operating costs expand proportionately with revenue increases  other applications are pursued for seed usage outside the prostate market  protocols are continued supporting the integrity of our product and sales and marketing expenses remain steady  management believes the company will reach breakeven with revenues of approximately million per month 
this is a decrease from the previous estimate of million in monthly revenue based on actions taken by new management that have over the past six months begun to improve the company s production operating efficiencies and its cost structure 
based on the foregoing assumptions  management believes cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments on hand at june  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
management s plans to attain breakeven and generate additional cash flows include increasing revenues from both new and existing customers and maintaining cost control 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will attain profitability or that the company will be able to attain its aggressive revenue targets 
if we do not experience the necessary increases in sales or if we experience unforeseen manufacturing constraints  we may need to obtain additional funding 
the company expects to finance its future cash needs through the sale of equity securities and possibly strategic collaborations or debt financing or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
if the company needs to raise additional money to fund its operations  funding may not be available to it on acceptable terms  or at all 
if the company is unable to raise additional funds when needed  it may not be able to market its products as planned or continue development and regulatory approval of its future products 
if the company raises additional funds through equity sales  these sales may be dilutive to existing investors
