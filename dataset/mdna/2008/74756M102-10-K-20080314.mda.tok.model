table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward looking statements  see forward looking statements and certain considerations contained in the introduction to this report 
overview we operate the largest for hire chemical bulk tank truck network in north america based on bulk service revenues  and we believe we have more than twice the revenues of our closest competitor in our primary chemical bulk transport market in the us the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists primarily of liquid and dry bulk chemicals which includes plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we primarily transport a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with tank wash facilities  logistics and other value added services 
we are a core carrier for many of the fortune companies engaged in chemical processing  including dow chemical  procter gamble  dupont and ppg industries  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with us operations 
our revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  the number of miles driven per load  our market share  and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products is  in turn  affected by many other industries  including consumer and industrial products  automotive  paints and coatings  and paper  and tends to vary with changing economic conditions 
additionally  we provide leasing  tank cleaning  logistics and transloading services 
our bulk service network consists primarily of company operated terminals  independently owned third party affiliate terminals and independent owner operator drivers 
affiliates are independent companies we contract with to operate trucking terminals and tank washes exclusively on our behalf in defined markets 
the affiliates provide the capital necessary to service their contracted business and are also responsible for most of the operating costs associated with servicing the contracted business 
owner operators are generally individual drivers who own or lease their tractors and agree to drive exclusively for us and our affiliate partners 
we believe the use of affiliates and independent owner operators provides the following key competitive advantages to us in the marketplace locally owned and operated affiliate terminals can provide superior  tailored customer service 
affiliates and independent owner operators are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue for each load they transport creating a variable cost structure that provides protection against cyclical downturns 
reliance on affiliate and independent owner operators creates an asset light business model that generally reduces our capital investment 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth are the ability to i obtain additional business from existing customers  ii acquire existing transportation related businesses in strategic markets  iii add new customers  and iv recruit and retain drivers 
revenue has been partially driven by pricing increases and we expect pricing increases to continue to positively impact our revenue growth 
however  the trucking industry has experienced a slowdown in recent months due to slowing economic conditions 
while a number of our customers operate their own private tank truck fleets and many of our customers source some of their logistics needs with rail  we expect our customers to continue to outsource a greater proportion of their logistics needs to full service tank truck carriers 
as a result of our leading market position  strong customer relationships and flexible business model  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from customers seeking consolidation of their shipping relationships and those opting to outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers 

table of contents to facilitate this growth  in december we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of boasso america corporation boasso for an aggregate purchase price of i million in cash less the outstanding long term indebtedness of boasso  subject to a working capital adjustment  and ii a million promissory note with a two year maturity for the benefit of boasso s principal stockholder  walter j 
boasso the boasso note excluding fees and direct costs 
boasso is the leading provider of international organization for standardization  or iso  tank container transportation and depot services in north america 
the iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
the iso tank container transportation market has experienced significant recent growth as chemical manufacturers move towards greater utilization of iso tank containers to efficiently transport their products around the world via sea  land and air 
in addition to further enhancing our scope of services  we believe there are synergies to be achieved from the boasso acquisition  including lower insurance cost for the boasso business and reduction of duplicative overhead and facilities 
beginning in under the direction of a new senior management team  we implemented several major strategic initiatives designed to enhance our operating flexibility  upgrade and standardize our business processes  improve customer service and increase profitability 
opportunistic affiliate conversions 
we intend to continue to focus on a less capital intensive business model based on affiliates and owner operators 
however  we continually evaluate our mix of affiliate and company terminals to optimize customer service  revenue growth  profitability and return on investment 
in situations where we can more efficiently operate facilities than the relevant affiliate  we may endeavor to purchase this affiliate s business to enhance our profitability and position us for better growth in key markets while maintaining our asset light structure through the use of owner operators at company owned terminals 
continued focus on safety and training 
we have made safety the main focus of our organization 
we have developed comprehensive programs to further focus our safety procedures and benchmark us against the best in the industry 
tangible results of this focus have already manifested themselves in decreasing at fault accident frequencies 
we also instituted a training program for terminal  field and headquarters personnel to augment our existing driver training and have began providing extensive technical and interpersonal training to all dispatchers  terminal managers  and supervisors 
focus on driver recruitment and retention 
our recruitment and retention effort is focused on providing drivers a welcoming opportunity with competitive compensation  an emphasis on professional development and an understanding that most drivers first priority is getting home safely to their families 
over the past four years we reduced driver turnover from to approximately  which we believe is well below the truckload industry average 
we are committed to being a driver focused company that provides both technical support and personal respect to these professionals 
we offer competitive compensation  encourage input from our drivers when making business decisions  and utilize full time customer service professionals who conduct both in bound and out bound calls to ensure driver satisfaction 
our driver organization contains field based recruiters who augment the friendly  small business environment provided by our business model 

table of contents expand scope of service capabilities 
we plan to continue to expand the scope of our service capabilities in order to serve the growing needs of our customer base 
as our customers continue to focus on their core businesses  we believe that they will increasingly rely on primary service transportation companies to provide value added services such as intermodal  tank cleaning and logistics services 
two initiatives to expand our service capabilities include the following strengthen our tank wash business over the past year  we have substantially improved our company owned tank wash facilities  installed new senior managers  trained staff and upgraded our safety program 
we are focused on expanding this business by motivating our drivers  our affiliates drivers and third party carriers to utilize our tank wash facilities and lessen usage of third party wash businesses 
in  we acquired brite clean  a tank wash operation that is expected to contribute approximately million in revenue in this acquisition further strengthened our leading market position in the tank wash business 
expand iso tank container business we currently participate in the iso tank container business by providing transportation services and with the boasso acquisition  we are now the market leader in the iso tank container transportation and depot services business in north america 
we believe that growing our iso tank container depot business offers us the opportunity to expand our service offerings to many of our existing customers and to capitalize on this fast growing segment which is being driven by the recent trend towards the globalization of petro chemical manufacturing capacity 
optimize network 
we are in the process of implementing several initiatives expected to increase profitability by minimizing the number of empty miles driven by our drivers 
we do this by encouraging our affiliates and owner operators to pursue additional revenue opportunities in their respective markets thereby increasing asset utilization 
for example  we intend to move our pricing towards a revenue per mile compensation structure with our owner operators instead of the existing percentage of revenue structure 
we believe this change will help align owner operators interests with ours and encourage them to increase load counts and improve backhaul rates resulting in increased revenue and operating income 
additionally  where necessary and when economically appropriate  we have expanded our company owned transportation capacity by investing in new trailers through various methods  including purchases and leases 
targeted acquisitions 
our industry is highly fragmented  providing us with the opportunity to grow our distribution network and further develop our tank wash business through acquisitions 
smaller chemical bulk transport operators are seeking to strengthen their competitive position by becoming part of a larger service network 
we believe that we are favorably positioned to benefit from this trend 
in early  we acquired two transportation companies for million 
in  we acquired brite clean for million  a small tank truck carrier for million  and boasso for million 
we expect these acquired businesses to generate approximately million in revenue in we intend to continue pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities that augment our position in key markets at attractive multiples 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
the asset lives used are presented in the following table average lives in years buildings and improvements tractors and terminal equipment trailers furniture and fixtures other equipment tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service 
any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales of disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
we identified three reporting units transportation operations  insurance operations and foreign operations 
we allocated goodwill to the transportation operation as it principally resulted from the acquisition of chemical leaman corporation in if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill within the reporting unit is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill 
we performed our annual assessment during the second quarter of fiscal year we used a combination of discounted cash flows and valuation of our capital structure to estimate the fair value 
projections for future cash flows were based on our recent operating trends and projected average growth rate for revenue of approximately over years 
the discount rate used to discount cash flows was based on our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 
even if our revenue projections were to decline by  we would not have an impairment of our goodwill 
if actual cash flows turn out to be significantly less than projections  then the impairment analysis could change  possibly resulting in future impairment charges 
deferred tax asset we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by sfas no 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance that is recorded or released against our deferred tax assets 
during  we released approximately million of our deferred tax valuation allowance based on our assessment that it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realizable based on income projections of future taxable income and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents these estimates of projected taxable income include price and volume increases as well as expected expansion of market share 
these projections are based on assumptions which management believes to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results although the actual results achieved may differ materially from these projections 
we continue to evaluate quarterly  the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
included in this assessment are estimates of projected future taxable income 
significant management judgment is required in this process and although realization is not assured  based on our assessment  we concluded it is more likely than not  such assets will continue to be realized 
at december  positive evidence included having achieved profitability for financial reporting purposes for eight consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter of fiscal additionally  we were no longer in a us cumulative loss position at the third quarter of fiscal we determine cumulative losses on a rolling thirty six months basis 
we project both aggregate us pre tax income as well as aggregate us taxable income for the years through sufficient to absorb million of the million existing net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  we had estimated million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  million in alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million in foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years through  while the alternative minimum tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely and the foreign tax credits may be carried forward for ten years 
we do not have a history of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  however  we have determined based on the weight of available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion of our million foreign tax credits may not be realized 
as a result we have established a valuation allowance of million against our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset 
we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable because we are projecting positive future taxable income through sufficient to absorb million of our million net operating loss carryforwards 
we will continue to review our forecast quarterly in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information 
accident claims reserves we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  owner operators and affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and million for workers compensation for periods after september  as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease  and for cargo losses 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own safety department personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency 
table of contents in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 
revenue recognition transportation revenues  including fuel surcharges and related costs are recognized on the date the freight is delivered 
other service revenues  consisting primarily of lease revenues from affiliates  owner operators and third parties  are recognized ratably over the lease period 
tank wash revenues are recognized when the wash is completed 
service revenues on insurance policies are recorded as a contractual percentage of premiums received ratably over the period that the insurance covers 
we have recognized all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted by our customers 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators and affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
absent a change in our collection efforts  a million increase in our receivables aged less than days resulting from transportation billings would increase our allowance for uncollectible receivables by less than million 
stock compensation plans stock compensation is determined by the assumptions required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair values of stock option grants are based upon the black scholes option pricing model and amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
restricted stock awards are issued and measured at market value on the date of grant and related compensation expense is recognized over time using graded vesting  which accelerates compensation expense into the first two years of the four year vesting period 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was million and million  respectively  for fiscal year as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our stock based awards 
the recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost is approximately four years 
for further discussion on stock based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain full time salaried employees and certain other employees under a collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates to and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current investment policy target asset allocation differs between our two plans  but it is between to for equities and to for bonds 
the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 

table of contents assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan 
at december   our projected benefit obligation pbo was million 
our projected net periodic pension expense is  a decrease in our assumed discount rate would increase our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense to  a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense to  a decrease in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would increase our net periodic pension expense to  a increase in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would decrease our net periodic pension expense to a credit of  change in accounting policy during the fourth quarter of  we changed our accounting policy for tires 
prior to this change  the cost of original and replacement tires mounted on equipment was reported as prepaid tires and depreciated based on estimated usage 
under the new policy  we capitalize the cost of tires mounted on purchased revenue equipment as a part of the total equipment cost and depreciate the cost over the useful life of the related equipment 
subsequent replacement tires are expensed at the time those tires are placed in service similar to other repairs and maintenance costs 
we believe that this new policy is preferable under the circumstances because it provides a more precise and less subjective method for recognizing expenses related to tires that is consistent with industry practice 
under sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  we are required to report a change in accounting policy by retrospectively applying the new policy to all prior periods presented  unless it is impractical to determine the prior period effect 
accordingly  we have adjusted our previously reported financial information for all periods presented 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for the financial impact of this change

fuel surcharge revenue increased million from as a result of higher average fuel prices 
approximately of the fuel surcharge revenue is reflected in purchased transportation and was paid to our affiliates and company owner operators during while the remaining company costs offset by the fuel surcharge are reflected in fuel  supplies and maintenance 
we managed a total of approximately  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to  trailers and  tractors at december  the decrease in tractors and trailers is the result of management s decision to sell off older models and equipment that would require significant repair 
we expect to either purchase or lease additional tractors and trailers in operating expenses totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in fuel  supplies and maintenance  a million increase in compensation  a million increase in insurance claims  a million increase in selling and administrative expenses and million losses from the disposals of terminal assets and sales of tractors compared to million net gains that resulted in  partially offset by a decrease of million in purchased transportation 
the decrease over the prior year in purchased transportation is primarily due in part to a shift of our transportation business from affiliates to company operations 
we pay our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue while we pay company owner operators approximately of the transportation revenue 
since we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  our purchased transportation costs will decrease more as revenues generated by affiliates decrease as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
our affiliates generated of our transportation and fuel surcharge revenue in compared to for the prior year 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue decreased to versus for the prior year due to this shift in our revenue mix 
compensation expense increased million  or primarily due to new or converted company terminals added over the prior year  and company wide compensation increases 
this increase was offset in part by a million decrease in stock compensation expense due to stock units being fully recognized in 
table of contents fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million or due primarily to fuel costs associated with the shift of revenue from affiliates to company owned terminals  increased lease costs as we fund the expansion of our tractor and trailer fleet through the use of operating leases  costs associated with the purchase of tires as we expand our fleet  increased maintenance as we increase the capacity of our equipment and increased costs to clean of our trailers 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  due primarily to increased depreciation for assets acquired in affiliate conversions and amortization of intangible assets resulting from increased acquisition activity in selling and administrative expenses increased million  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in bad debt expense due to credit adjustments as a result of a reduction in days sales outstanding in  a million increase in qci and qsi expenses due to affiliate conversions and new tank wash terminals and an increase in travel costs as we add more company operations in addition to increased driver recruitment costs and increased building rental and maintenance costs associated with corporate and terminal buildings 
insurance claims expense increased million  or  due primarily to the settlement of three large claims in the fourth quarter of during  we recorded a million reduction in claims on insurance policies retained by our insurance subsidiary  and million of insurance reimbursement 
loss on disposal of property and equipment was million in as compared to a gain of million in  primarily due to the disposal of terminal assets and the sale of tractors and trailers at a loss compared to the sale of several real properties that generated million of gain with the remaining net gain generated from the sale of tractors and trailers in the impairment loss on property and equipment was million and million in and  respectively

the benefit from income taxes was million in as compared to a benefit from income taxes of million in the effective rate for the year ended december  was  this rate is lower than our anticipated effective rate in large part due to recording a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset for foreign tax credits 
the company s effective rate would have been if this valuation allowance had not been recorded 
this change was primarily due to the release of approximately million of our million deferred tax valuation allowance in this release was due to improved operating results and the determination that it is more likely than not that expected future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets 
net loss was million for versus net income of million for for the reasons outlined above 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  compared to revenues 
transportation revenue increased by million or compared to the increase in transportation revenue is primarily attributable to rate increases and an increase in the number of miles driven offset in part by a reduction in the total number of loads from the prior year 
the decreased load count was spread across most of our customer base 
other service revenue decreased by million or in versus this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in rental revenues resulting from reduced trailer rental revenue generated from our affiliates  partially offset by a million increase in revenues at our qsi subsidiary 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million from as a result of higher average fuel prices and an increase in the number of miles driven during the year 
approximately of the fuel surcharge revenue is reflected in purchased transportation and was paid to our affiliates and company owner operators during fiscal year while the remaining company costs offset by the fuel surcharge are reflected in fuel  supplies and maintenance 
we managed a total of approximately  trailers and  tractors at the end of compared to trailers and  tractors at december  the increase in trailers is primarily due to our purchase or lease of additional trailers during fiscal year the increase in tractors is partially the result of acquiring affiliates and new businesses and expanding the number of owner operators through our tractor lease program 
we expect to either purchase or lease additional tractors and trailers in operating expenses totaled million in  an increase of million or from the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a million increase in purchased transportation  a million increase in fuel  supplies and maintenance and a million increase in compensation 
the increase over the prior year in purchased transportation is primarily due to a majority of the million of additional fuel surcharges being passed through to our affiliates and owner operators offset in part by a shift of our transportation business from affiliates to more company operations 
we pay our affiliates approximately of the transportation revenue while we pay company owner operators approximately of the transportation revenue 
since we pay our affiliates a greater percentage of revenues generated by them than is paid to company owner operators  our purchased transportation costs will decrease more as revenues generated by affiliates decrease as a percentage of total transportation revenue 
our affiliates generated of our transportation and fuel surcharge revenue in compared to for the prior year 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue decreased to versus for the prior year due to this shift in our revenue mix 
compensation expense increased million  or primarily due to new or converted company terminals added over the prior year  company wide compensation increases and an increase in stock based compensation expense offset in part by decreases from the prior year for pension  severance and hiring costs for senior executives 
the increase in stock based compensation expense is due in part to the implementation of sfas r on january  fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million or due primarily to fuel costs associated with the shift of revenue from affiliates to company owned terminals  increased lease costs as we fund the expansion of our trailer fleet through the use of operating leases  costs associated with the purchase of tires as we expand our fleet and an increase in the number of miles driven  increased maintenance as we increase the capacity of our equipment and increased cleaning of our trailers 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  due primarily to the sale of tractors in the prior year and the use of more leased trailers versus purchasing trailers as well as a number of assets becoming fully depreciated throughout and 
table of contents selling and administrative expenses increased million  or

liquidity we believe that  based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolver  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  make required payments of principal and interest on our debt  including obligations under our credit agreement  and satisfy other long term contractual commitments for the next twelve months 
however  for periods extending beyond twelve months  if our operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolving portions of the abl facility are not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures  debt service and other long term contractual commitments  we would be required to seek alternative financing 
these alternatives would likely include another restructuring or refinancing of our long term debt  the sale of a portion or all of our assets or operations  or the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives were not available in a 
table of contents timely manner or on satisfactory terms  or were not permitted under our existing agreements  we might default on some or all of our obligations 
if we default on our obligations and the debt under the indentures for the notes and notes were to be accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our indebtedness  and we might be forced into bankruptcy 
other issues we have historically sought to acquire smaller local operators as part of our program of strategic growth 
we continue to evaluate potential accretive acquisitions in order to capitalize on the consolidation occurring in the industry and expect to fund such acquisitions from available sources of liquidity  including borrowings under the revolving portion of our abl facility 
while uncertainties relating to environmental  labor and other regulatory matters exist within the trucking industry  management is not aware of any trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or the accompanying financial statements 
our credit rating is affected by many factors  including our financial results  operating cash flows and total indebtedness 
as a holding company with no significant assets other than ownership of of qd llc s membership units  qdi also depends upon qd llc s cash flows to service our debt 
qd llc s ability to make distributions to qdi is restricted by the covenants contained in the revolving portion of our abl facility and the indentures governing the notes and notes 
however  apollo as our controlling shareholder may have an interest in pursuing reorganizations  restructurings or other transactions involving us that  in their judgment  could enhance their equity investment even though those transactions might involve increasing qd llc s leverage or impairing qd llc s creditworthiness in order to decrease qdi s leverage 
while the restrictions in the revolving portion of our abl facility cover a wide variety of arrangements that have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions  the abl facility and the indentures may not afford the holders of our debt protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  restructuring  merger or similar transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from i interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  ii foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and iii increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our variable rate borrowings under the abl facility and the notes 
with regard to the abl facility at qd llc s option  the initial applicable margin for borrowings under the current asset tranche will be with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings

table of contents at december   a point increase in the current per annum interest rate for each would result in million of additional interest expense during the next year 
the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous one percentage point increase in the rates of all of our indebtedness and that the principal amount of each is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness are based  our various options to elect the lower of two different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were positively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our inter company loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
in  diesel fuel prices rose to near record levels 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
in and  a majority of fuel price fluctuations were covered through fuel surcharges
