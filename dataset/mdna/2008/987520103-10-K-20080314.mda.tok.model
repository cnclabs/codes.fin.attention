all statements other than statements of historical facts included herein are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature  which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and which include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  or similar expressions 
these statements are not guaranties of future performance  and the company makes no commitment to update or disclose any revisions to forward looking statements  or any facts  events or circumstances after the date hereof that may bear upon forward looking statements 
because such statements involve risks and uncertainties  actual actions and strategies and the timing and expected results thereof may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those disclosed in this annual report and other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company makes no commitment to update these factors or to revise any forward looking statements for events or circumstances occurring after the statement is issued 
at any time when the company makes forward looking statements  it desires to take advantage of the safe harbor which is afforded such statements under the private securities litigation reform act of risk factors we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below  together with the cautionary statement under the caption forward looking statements described above and other information contained in this annual report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission before purchasing our securities 
our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations 
if any of these risks occur  our business  results of operations or financial condition could suffer  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy  failure to consummate acquisitions could limit our growth and failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely impact our results 
our business strategy includes continued growth through strategic acquisitions  which depends upon our ability to identify potential acquisitions  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and the availability of financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to negotiate and consummate acquisitions and effectively integrate the acquisitions into our business 
acquisitions involve integrating product lines  employees and manufacturing facilities and include risks relating to employee turnover and sales channel tension 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully manage all of these challenges and risks in the future and there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions will be successful 
failure to consummate appropriate acquisitions would adversely impact our growth and failure to successfully integrate them would adversely affect our results 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we compete with manufacturers of both branded and private label dental products 
some of our competitors have greater financial  research  manufacturing  marketing and other resources which could allow them to compete more successfully 
as a result we may not be able to achieve  maintain or increase market share or margins  or compete effectively against these companies 
in addition  new competitors are constantly entering the markets in which we participate 
we rely heavily on key distributors  and if any of them stop doing business with us it would significantly impact our operating results 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales were made through two distributors 
if either of these two distributors were to materially change the timing of their order patterns  our financial results in any given short term period could be adversely affected 
additionally  the loss of either distributor as a customer  or a material change in our relationship with either distributor would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition until we find an alternative means to distribute our products 
if we are unable to successfully manage growth  our results could be materially adversely affected 
our future performance will depend  in large part  upon our ability to implement and manage our growth effectively 
our growth in the future will continue to place a significant strain on our management  administrative  operational  and financial resources 
we anticipate that  if we are successful in expanding our business  we will be required to recruit and hire a substantial number of new managerial and support personnel 
failure to retain and attract additional management personnel who can manage our growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on our performance 
to manage our growth successfully  we will also have to continue to consolidate our operations and improve and upgrade operational  financial and accounting systems  controls and infrastructure as well as expand  train and manage our employees 
our failure to manage the future expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our future performance is materially dependent upon our senior management 
our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management  particularly alfred e 
brennan  chief executive officer  and arthur l 
herbst  jr  president and chief financial officer  among others 
the loss of the services of either mr 
brennan or mr 
herbst could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have employment agreements with each of messrs 
brennan and herbst 
we do not currently have key man life insurance policies on any of our employees 
competition for senior management is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
difficulty in obtaining goods and services from our vendors and suppliers could adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on certain of our vendors and suppliers 
we believe we have good relationships with and are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from our vendors and suppliers 
when possible  we attempt to have multiple sources for key materials and supplies 
if our vendors and suppliers were no longer able to supply product  we could face difficulty in immediately obtaining needed goods and services  which could adversely affect our business for a temporary period 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results due to factors outside of our control 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results caused by a number of factors  including business and industry conditions  the timing of acquisitions  the buying patterns of our largest customers  technology changes  timing of sales promotions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and other factors beyond our control 
all these factors make it difficult to predict operating results for any particular period 
certain of our products and manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation  and our failure or the failure of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and obtain or maintain the required regulatory approvals for these products could hinder or prevent their sale and increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
in addition  there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully reintroduce any products that may have been recalled 
our ability to continue manufacturing and selling those of our products that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  the environmental protection agency  state  local or foreign laws or other federal  state or foreign governmental bodies or agencies is subject to a number of risks  including the promulgation of stricter laws or regulations  or the withdrawal of the approval needed to sell one or more of our products 
we are also subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration and the securities and exchange commission  among others 
with respect to certain products we purchase  our ability to sell such products to our customers is dependent upon the supplier complying with all applicable laws and regulations 
the failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
the costs of complying with these regulations and the delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or new laws  regulations  or regulatory requirements adverse to our business may force us to recall products  increase our costs of regulatory compliance  prevent us from selling a product or hinder our growth 
to the extent that we recall products  there can be no assurance that we will be able to timely and successfully reintroduce any products that may have been recalled into the market 
changes in standard of care relating to dental health may impact future results 
the demand for dental products is impacted by the dental health care standards 
if the industry standards were to shift to a standard of care that changed the frequency or type of procedures performed or if third party insurance coverage were to substantially change  the market for our company s products could be adversely affected 
technological change could result in loss of market share  product obsolescence and dependence on new products 
our future success depends on the ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology  industry standards and customers changing demands 
if we do not timely acquire  develop  complete testing  obtain regulatory approval and sell commercial quantities of new products in response to a technological change or the changing demands of customers  we could lose market share and our products could become obsolete 
prices and availability of raw materials may fluctuate which may adversely affect our margins 
if our raw material products  such as resin  were to increase in price significantly  the cost of manufacturing products would increase 
if we were unable to pass the increased cost along to customers  this could adversely affect our business 
in addition  if our raw materials were not available for a period of time  this would impair our ability to obtain necessary materials which could adversely affect our revenue 
overall economic conditions could have a material effect on our results 
our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions  primarily in the us changing economic conditions  including unemployment  a decline in dental insurance coverage  health care reform  or government regulation could result in a lower demand for our products 
loss of intellectual property protection and related disputes could negatively affect our results 
our company utilizes copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  licenses and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken to protect our intellectual property or proprietary technology will be adequate or enforceable to prevent misappropriation 
in addition  the cost of prosecuting and defending such actions can be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results 
we rely upon others to assist in the education and promotion of our products  and the loss of the participation of these individuals could adversely affect our net sales 
changes in the rules governing promotion of our products might likewise adversely affect our net sales 
we work with various dental clinicians to educate the dental community on the features and benefits of our products 
some clinicians are a key component to our strategy for growing our sales 
the inability or unwillingness of one or more of these clinicians to continue to assist us could negatively impact the sales of certain significant products 
if new laws are enacted or new regulations promulgated that restrict promotional communications about medical products  this may likewise adversely affect our net sales 
we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design  manufacture and marketing of our products 
claims alleging product liability may involve large potential damages and significant defense costs 
we currently maintain insurance coverage for such claims but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by our insurance 
a product liability claim could adversely affect our reputation 
a successful claim against us in excess of the available insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results

the company markets its products primarily in the us the company also markets its products in several international markets  including canada  europe  south america  central america  and the pacific rim 
international sales represented less than of the company s total net sales in and less than of the company s total net sales in and critical accounting policies the sec has requested that all registrants include in their md a a description of their most critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition allowance for doubtful accounts the company has of its december  accounts receivable balance with two large customers see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item with the remaining balance comprised of amounts due from numerous customers  some of which are international 
accounts receivable balances are subject to credit risk 
management has reserved for expected credit losses  sales returns and allowances  and discounts based upon past experience  as well as knowledge of current customer information 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be impacted by unforeseen circumstances 
we continuously review our reserve balance and refine the estimates to reflect any changes in circumstances 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out fifo basis 
inventory values are based upon standard costs  which approximate historical costs 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a write down for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated product demand and other information related to the inventory including planned introduction of new products and changes in technology 
if demand for the company s products is significantly different than management s expectations  the value of inventory could be materially impacted 
inventory write downs are included in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  effective january   goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed by management for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  the determination of the amount of impairment would be based on management s judgment as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from the assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
contingencies the company and its subsidiaries from time to time are subject to various contingencies  including legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
management  with the assistance of external legal counsel  performs an analysis of current litigation  and will record liabilities if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes the reserve is adequate  however  it cannot guarantee that costs will not be incurred in excess of current estimates 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations the company periodically acquires businesses 
all business acquisitions completed subsequent to were accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method 
the purchase method requires the company to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the allocation of acquisition cost to assets acquired includes the consideration of identifiable intangible assets 
the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the company s measurement of fair values and certain preacquisition contingencies may impact the company s cost allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed for a period of up to one year following the date of an acquisition 
the company utilizes a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities 
for larger acquisitions  third party appraisers are utilized to assist the company in determining the fair value and useful lives of identifiable intangibles  including the determination of intangible assets that have an indefinite life 
the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities and the useful lives assigned by the company will impact the determination of future operating performance of the company

recent financial accounting standards board statements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements 
this statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements  it does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   but was amended on february  to defer the effective date for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement as it relates to our financial assets and financial liabilities will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands 
market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  the company finances acquisitions  capital expenditures and its working capital needs with borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
due to the variable interest rate feature on the debt  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s average debt balance  a theoretical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately   and of additional interest expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales of the company s products in a given foreign country can be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate 
however  the company sells less than of its products outside the united states 
of these foreign sales  are denominated in euros and in canadian dollars with the remainder denominated in us dollars 
the company does not feel that foreign currency movements have a material impact on its financial statements 
the company does not use derivatives to manage its interest rate or foreign exchange rate risks
