critical accounting estimates and judgments the significant accounting policies requiring our estimates and judgments are discussed below 
such estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  changes in laws and regulations  observance of industry trends and information received from third parties 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported consolidated financial statement amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
valuation of investments 
we complete a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether any decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is deemed other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed 
unless other factors cause us to reach a contrary conclusion  investments with a fair market value significantly less than cost for more than days are deemed to have a decline in value that is other than temporary 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is charged to earnings based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
risks and uncertainties are inherent in our other than temporary decline in value assessment methodology 
risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about financial condition or liquidity  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about future prospects  unfavorable changes in economic or social conditions and unfavorable changes in interest rates or credit ratings 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs mainly commission  underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and charged to operations over periods in which the related premiums are earned 
ceding commissions from reinsurers  which include expense allowances  are deferred and recognized over the period premiums are earned for the underlying policies reinsured 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and expected investment income on those unearned premiums  as computed on a product line basis 
we routinely evaluate the realizability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
at december  and  there was no premium deficiency related to deferred policy acquisition costs 
goodwill 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which we adopted as of january   goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
we completed our last annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
methods for estimating reporting unit values include market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
with the exception of market quotations  all of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions 
deferred tax assets 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred federal income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for tax rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided against our deferred tax assets to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be adequate to realize these future tax benefits 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established for claims which have already been incurred by the policyholder but which we have not yet paid 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through each balance sheet date 
the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
these reserves are revised periodically and are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
see  item business analysis of losses and lae and analysis of loss and lae reserve development 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  the actual ultimate amounts may differ from the recorded amounts 
a small percentage change could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a change in december  reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would have produced a million change to pretax earnings 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
an actuarial range of ultimate unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is developed independent of management s best estimate and is only used to check the reasonableness of that estimate 
there is no exclusive method for determining this range  and judgment enters into the process 
the primary actuarial technique utilized is a loss development analysis in which ultimate losses are projected based upon historical development patterns 
the primary assumption underlying this loss development analysis is that the historical development patterns will be a reasonable predictor of the future development of losses for accident years which are less mature 
an alternate actuarial technique  known as the bornhuetter ferguson method  combines an analysis of loss development patterns with an initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
this approach is most useful for recent accident years 
in addition to assuming the stability of loss development patterns  this technique is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
consequently  the bornhuetter ferguson method is primarily used to confirm the results derived from the loss development analysis 
the range of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses estimated by our actuary as of december  was million to million 
our best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  is million 
our carried reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  is comprised of million in case reserves and million in incurred but not reported reserves 
in setting this estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  we have assumed  among other things  that current trends in loss frequency and severity will continue and that the actuarial analysis was empirically valid 
in the absence of any specific factors indicating actual experience at either extreme of the actuarial range  we have established a best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses which is approximately million higher than the midpoint of the actuarial range 
it would be expected that management s best estimate would move within the actuarial range from year to year due to changes in our operations and changes within the marketplace 
due to the inherent uncertainty in reserve estimates  there can be no assurance that the actual losses ultimately experienced will fall within the actuarial range 
however  because of the breadth of the actuarial range  we believe that it is reasonably likely that actual losses will fall within such range 
our reserve requirements are also interrelated with product pricing and profitability 
we must price our products at a level sufficient to fund our policyholder benefits and still remain profitable 
because claim expenses represent the single largest category of our expenses  inaccuracies in the assumptions used to estimate the amount of such benefits can result in our failing to price our products appropriately and to generate sufficient premiums to fund our operations 
recognition of profit sharing commissions 
profit sharing commission is calculated and recognized when the loss ratio  as determined by a qualified actuary  deviates from contractual targets 
we receive a provisional commission as policies are produced as an advance against the later determination of the profit sharing commission actually earned 
the profit sharing commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the standard commercial segment to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance in thousands 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio estimated ultimate loss ratio booked to at december  effect of actual above estimated loss ratio at december  effect of actual below estimated loss ratio at december  the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the specialty commercial segment for the effective quota share treaty with republic at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance in thousands

during fiscal  our total revenues were million  representing an approximately increase over the million in total revenues for fiscal increased retention of business produced by our specialty commercial segment and standard commercial segment and increased production by our personal segment were the primary causes of the increase in revenue 
specialty commercial segment revenues increased million during as compared to revenues from our personal segment increased million during  due largely to geographic expansion into new states 
the retention of business produced by the standard commercial segment that was previously retained by third parties was the primary reason for that segment s million increase in revenue during net gain on investments of million for the period ended december   as compared to a net loss on investments of million for  was the primary reason for an increase in revenue for corporate 
we reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  net income was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal during the period ended december   we recorded million of interest expense from amortization attributable to the deemed discount on convertible promissory notes issued in january  and subsequently converted to common stock during the second quarter of the increase in net income was also attributable to increased revenue as discussed above  including additional investment income from a larger investment portfolio  primarily resulting from increased retention of premiums 
prior year favorable loss reserve development of million during as compared to million of prior year favorable development recognized during also contributed to the increase in net income

standard commercial segment 
gross premiums written for the standard commercial segment were million for the year ended december   which was slightly less than the million reported for the same period in net premiums written were million for the year ended december  as compared to million reported for the same period in increased competition and rate pressure challenged premium volume growth by the standard commercial segment throughout total revenue for the standard commercial segment of million for the year ended december  was million more than the million reported during the year ended december  this approximately increase in total revenue was primarily due to increased net premiums earned of million and increased net investment income of million 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million  in both cases due to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure 
increased contingent commission adjustments related to adverse development on prior accident years of million also partially offset the increases in revenue 
pre tax income for our standard commercial segment of million for the year ended december  increased million  or approximately  from the million reported for the same period of increased revenue as discussed above was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and additional operating expenses of million  mostly due to the earning of increased premium retention 
the net loss ratio for the year ended december  was as compared to the reported for the same period of the net loss ratio was unfavorably impacted by lower ceded losses of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the gross loss ratio before reinsurance was for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period the prior year 
the gross loss results for the year ended december  included million of favorable prior year development as compared to million of favorable prior year development for the year ended december  absent prior year development  the gross incurred losses and loss adjustment expense before reinsurance for the standard commercial segment were higher by million primarily due to competitive market conditions in the current accident year 
the standard commercial segment reported net expense ratios of and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the net expense ratio for was slightly higher primarily due to costs to assume from clarendon national insurance company the unearned premium previously produced by the standard commercial segment 
specialty commercial segment 
the million of total revenue for the year ended december  was million over the million reported for this approximately increase in revenue was largely due to increased net premiums earned of million as a result of the increased retention of business 
the specialty commercial segment recognized million of contingent ceding commission under quota share agreements for treaty effective  due to improved underwriting results 
increased net investment income contributed an additional million to the increase in revenue 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million due to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure  as well as a decrease in finance charges of million 
pre tax income for the specialty commercial segment of million was million higher than the million reported in increased revenue  discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and increased operating expenses of million due mostly to production related expenses that are directly related to increased earned premium 
the specialty commercial segment reported a net loss ratio of for as compared to for favorable prior year development of million for the year ended december  was the primary cause for the decrease in the net loss ratio 
the specialty commercial segment reported a net expense ratio of for as compared to for personal segment 
net premium written for our personal segment increased million during the year ended december  to million compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in premium was due mostly to continued geographic expansion that began in total revenue for the personal segment increased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million the prior year 
higher earned premium of million was the primary reason for the increase in revenue for the period 
increased finance charges of million were offset by lower investment income of million due to the reallocation of capital to other segments for their increased retention of premium and lower third party commission and processing fee revenue of million 
pre tax income for the personal segment was million for the year ended december  as compared to million the prior year 
the increased revenue  as discussed above  was offset by increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and increased operating expenses of million due mostly to production related expenses attributable to the increased earned premium 
the personal segment reported a net loss ratio of for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
a competitive pricing environment and the new business impact associated with geographic expansion were the primary reasons for the increase in the net loss ratio 
we recognized million of favorable prior accident year development during the year ended december  and the personal segment reported a net expense ratio of for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in the net expense ratio was mainly due to increased finance charges in relation to earned premium  as well as fixed overhead allocations to piic in each period 
corporate 
total revenue for corporate increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to million of net gains on our investment portfolio during as compared to million of net losses recognized during corporate pre tax loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
the decreased loss was mostly due to the absence of the million of interest expense incurred in from amortization attributable to the deemed discount on convertible promissory notes issued in january  these notes were converted to common stock during the second quarter of also contributing to the decreased loss was the net gain on investments of million in compared to a net loss on investments of million in interest expense was also million lower due to the permanent financing of debt used to acquire the subsidiaries comprising the specialty commercial segment in most of this debt was either converted to equity in the second quarter of or repaid with proceeds from our public equity offering in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting these improvements were increased operating expenses of million for due mostly to increased consulting costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley section requirements and new employees 
comparison of years ended december  and december  management overview 
during fiscal  our total revenues were million  representing a increase over the million in total revenues for fiscal the acquisition of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment in the first quarter of contributed million to the increase in total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the following table provides additional information concerning the increases in revenue contributed by these acquisitions 
year ended december  in thousands earned premium on retained business third party commission revenue investment income  finance charges and other revenue items revenue contributions from acquisitions the retention of business produced in the standard commercial segment that was previously retained by third parties also contributed million to the increase in revenue  but was partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million primarily attributable to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure 
earned premium from the personal segment contributed million and additional finance charges contributed million to the increase in revenue  but were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million attributable to increased retention of the policies produced 
the investment of funds derived from the implementation of our capital plan and a trust account to secure the future guaranteed payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries contributed another million to revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by realized losses on our investment portfolio of million in we reported net income of million for the year ended december   which is the same as the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  net income was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in diluted earnings per share was partially due to issuing an additional million shares during fiscal in addition  during fiscal we recorded million of interest expense from amortization attributable to the deemed discount on convertible promissory notes issued in january  and converted to common stock during the second quarter of in the absence of this non cash expense  our net income for the year ended december  would have been million representing an approximately increase over the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of our net income without such interest expense to our reported results

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the widely used industry calculation that offsets expenses with agency fee income 
prior period comparative expense ratios have been restated 
net combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio 
standard commercial segment 
net written premium for the standard commercial segment was million for the year ended december   or approximately more than the million for the year ended december  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the standard commercial segment began retaining written premium through ahic that was previously retained by third parties 
on july   the standard commercial segment assumed million of in force policies previously produced for clarendon 
the total revenue for the standard commercial segment of million for the year ended december  was million more than the million reported the prior year 
this approximately increase in total revenue was primarily due to an increase of million in net premiums earned 
increased net investment income contributed an additional million to the increase in total revenue 
these increases were partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million primarily due to the shift from a third party agency structure to an insurance underwriting structure and also affected by lower than expected profit sharing commission 
the increase in total revenue was also partially offset by lower processing and service fees of million attributable to the change to an insurance underwriting structure 
pre tax income for the standard commercial segment of million for the year ended december  increased million  or approximately  over the million reported for the prior year 
increased revenue  as discussed above  was the primary reason for the increase in pre tax income  partially offset by increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and additional operating expenses of million  mostly due to increased premium production 
the standard commercial segment reported a net loss ratio of for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss ratio of for the prior year 
the loss ratios gross of reinsurance were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in the gross loss ratio was partially impacted by million of favorable reserve development from prior accident years recognized during there was no prior year reserve development recognized during the year ended december  as we began retaining this business during the third quarter of the standard commercial segment reported net expense ratios of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net expense ratio for was higher primarily due to costs to assume from clarendon the unearned premium previously produced by the standard commercial segment 
specialty commercial segment 
all of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment were acquired effective january  the million of total revenue was derived mostly from million of earned premium on produced business that was assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries and third party commission revenue of million on the portion of business produced by the specialty commercial segment that was retained by third parties 
the remaining million of revenue was primarily derived from investment income and finance charges 
pre tax income for the specialty commercial segment of million was primarily due to revenue as discussed above less i million in operating expenses  comprised mostly of commission expense and salary related expenses  ii incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of million on the portion of business assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries  iii million of amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of the subsidiaries included in the specialty commercial segment  and iv million in interest expense personal segment 
net premium written in the personal segment increased million during the year ended december  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in premium was due mostly to new state expansion during total revenue for the personal segment increased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million the prior year 
higher earned premium of million and higher finance charges of million was partially offset by lower ceding commission revenue of million and lower processing and service fees of million due to the assumption of the texas non standard automobile premium beginning late in pre tax income for the personal segment decreased million  or approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in pre tax income for the year ended december  was increased losses and loss adjustment expenses of million as evidenced by an increase in the net loss ratio to versus reported in the increase in the net loss ratio was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment and favorable reserve development of million recognized during as compared to million recognized during in addition  new business written as a result of new programs and expansion into new states had not yet benefited from the reduced loss ratios typically associated with renewals of seasoned business 
the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses was partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above 
the personal segment reported net expense ratios of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net expense ratio was primarily a function of increased earned premium and policy fees income in without corresponding increases in expenses 
corporate 
total revenue for corporate decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to million in realized losses on our investment portfolio in this was partially offset by million in interest earned on a trust account established in the first quarter of securing the guaranteed future payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries 
see note  accounting policies and note  structured settlements 
corporate pre tax loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increased pre tax loss was primarily due to million in interest expense from amortization attributable to the deemed discount on convertible promissory notes issued in january  this interest expense had no impact on our cash flow or book value 
also contributing to the increased corporate pre tax loss was additional interest expense of million comprised of i million from the trust preferred securities issued in the second quarter of see note  notes payable  ii million of amortization of the discount on the future guaranteed payments to the sellers of acquired subsidiaries see note  structured settlements  iii million from a related party promissory note issued in january  iv million from borrowings under our revolving credit facility in january see note  notes payable and note  credit facilities  and v million from the convertible notes issued in january also contributing to the increase in pre tax loss was increased salary and related expenses of million  professional services of million  decreased revenue discussed above and travel expenses of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that interest rate risk  credit risk and equity risk are the types of market risk to which we are principally exposed 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to these securities is interest rate risk 
in general  the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million 
the effective duration of our portfolio as of december  was years 
should interest rates increase  our fixed income investment portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by  or million  representing the effective duration multiplied by the change in market interest rates 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in a  or million  increase in the market value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
credit risk 
an additional exposure to our fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage the credit risk by investing primarily in investment grade securities and limiting our exposure to a single issuer 
as of december   our fixed income investments were in the following us treasury bonds  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us treasury bills and other short term 
as of december   of our fixed income securities were rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurers to whom we have ceded underwriting risk 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage it assumes  we remain obligated to our policyholders in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
in order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies  we use financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a excellent or better 
equity price risk 
investments in equity securities which are subject to equity price risk made up of our portfolio as of december  the carrying values of equity securities are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the fair value of our equity securities as of december  was million 
the fair value of our equity securities would increase or decrease by million assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices as of the balance sheet date 
this would increase or decrease stockholders equity by 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what should be considered the best or worse case scenario
