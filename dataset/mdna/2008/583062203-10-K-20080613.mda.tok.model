company overview and recent developments meade instruments corp 
is engaged in the design  manufacture  marketing and sales of consumer optics products  primarily telescopes and binoculars 
we design our products in house or with the assistance of external consultants 
most of our products are manufactured overseas by contract manufacturers in asia while our high end telescopes have historically been manufactured and assembled in our us and mexico facilities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our us manufacturing operations and the transition of high end telescope production to our mexico facilities 
sales of our products are driven by an in house sales force as well as a network of sales representatives throughout the us we currently operate out of three primary locations irvine  california  tijuana  mexico  and rhede  germany 
our california facility serves as the company s corporate headquarters and us distribution center  our mexico facilities perform manufacturing  assembly  repair  packaging  research and development  and other general and administrative functions 
our germany location is primarily engaged in the distribution of our finished products in europe 
our business is highly seasonal and our financial results vary significantly on a quarter by quarter basis throughout each year 
we believe that the company holds valuable brand names and intellectual property that provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
the meade brand name is ubiquitous in the consumer telescope market  while the coronado brand name represents a unique niche in the area of solar astronomy 
our bresser brand covers a variety of optical and other products and is primarily recognized in europe 
during fiscal we sold our simmons  weaver and redfield sports optics brands for gross proceeds of million 
the company hired a new chief executive officer in may with extensive experience in turnaround situations in an effort to restructure the company and return it to profitability after two years of financial losses 
in the ensuing months  the company replaced a significant number of its executives  including its senior officer over operations and its chief financial officer 
the company embarked on a number of initiatives to resolve supply chain constraints  to reduce the company s cost structure  to reduce the number of skus and required level of inventory  and to increase investment for new product innovations and introductions 
during the fiscal year ended february   our results were negatively impacted by the closure and consolidation of four us facilities into one  related headcount reductions and severance costs  aggressive reductions in inventory  and legal and accounting fees associated with the company s restatement of historical results due to errors in accounting for stock options and deferred rent 
during fiscal  our results have been negatively impacted by further headcount reductions and severance costs and further reductions in inventory 
however  the overall turnaround of the company is a continuing effort  and we will continue to evaluate long term opportunities to further reduce our cost structure  these opportunities  if executed upon  may result in additional short term costs that must be recognized in our current consolidated financial statements 
in august  we completed a private placement of million shares of the company s common stock for gross proceeds of million that improved the company s liquidity 
however  due to the seasonality of the company s business  we continue to rely on our domestic credit facility to meet much of our liquidity needs 
while the company was in compliance with the restrictive covenants in the credit facility agreement as of the end of fiscal  from time to time in recent history the company has not been in compliance with certain of the restrictive covenants 
while we have historically been able to obtain amendments and or waivers from our lender  there is no guarantee that the company will be in compliance with the restrictive covenants in the future  and in the event of noncompliance  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain an amendment or waiver 
if no amendment or waiver is obtained  the company may be in default under the provisions of the credit facility and the company s lender may accelerate repayment 
in this event  we may need to raise funds to repay our lender and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of director s formed a special committee that has engaged an investment bank to assist the company in exploring strategic alternatives 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we sold our simmons  weaver and redfield sport optics brands for gross proceeds of million 
the exploration of strategic alternatives has been ongoing 
such alternatives may involve a financial restructuring of the company s capital structure or potentially the sale of all or a portion of the company 
at this time there can be no assurance that the company will be able to execute on any strategic alternatives 
the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended february  were prepared assuming the company would continue as a going concern  however  the company s recurring losses and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt as a result of a declining sales trend  recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit and is subject to the company s ability to increase revenue  restructure the company by significantly reducing its cost structure and or consummating a strategic transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to assist users in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy complies with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically at the time of shipment  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  including a fixed price  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically at the time of shipment  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is not recognized at the time of shipment if these criteria are not met 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts product returns or offers markdown incentives 
material management judgments must be made and used in connection with establishing sales returns and allowances estimates 
the company continuously monitors and tracks returns and allowances and records revenues net of provisions for returns and allowances 
the company s estimate of sales returns and allowances is based upon several factors including historical experience  current market and economic conditions  customer demand and acceptance of the company s products and or any notification received by the company of such a return 
historically  sales returns and allowances have been within management s estimates  however  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from management s estimates depending on actual market conditions at the time of the return 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets 
the company also evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete product 
these evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of the company s products  and current market and economic conditions 
inventory may be written down based on such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than its cost 
however  if the company is not able to meet its sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate significantly from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of the company s inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
as required by sfas no 
 we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 
any impairment losses will be reflected in operating income 
income taxes a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is necessary in the determination of the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability and the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company assesses the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment  the company is required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  the value of that asset will be reduced to its expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
if it is determined that a deferred tax asset that had previously been written down will be realized in the future  the value of that deferred tax asset will be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when the determination is made 
actual results may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the evidence used to assess the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on march  as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognized no material increase in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
at both the adoption date of march  and as of february   unrecognized tax benefits  all of which affect the effective tax rate if recognized  were million 
management does not anticipate that there will be a material change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
as of the adoption date of march  and as of february   accrued interest related to uncertain tax benefit was less than million 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
results of operations the nature of the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  sales in the third quarter ended november th each year have been higher than sales achieved in each of the other three fiscal quarters of the year 
thus  expenses and  to a greater extent  operating income may significantly vary by quarter 
therefore  caution is advised when appraising results for a period shorter than a full year  or when comparing any period other than to the same period of the previous year 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling expenses general and administrative expenses restructuring costs esop contribution expense research and development expenses goodwill impairment total operating expenses loss from operations interest expense loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss the following table summarizes our net sales by product category 
fiscal years ended february  february  telescopes related products riflescopes binoculars other net sales fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal from is due to several factors 
first  discovery channel stores  formerly one of the company s top customers  announced during the first quarter of that it was closing all of its retail locations 
net sales to the discovery channel stores decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal second  the company shut down its us manufacturing operations during the third quarter of fiscal and transferred those operations to mexico  which constrained the supply of higher end telescope products during the latter portion of the year 
third  the telescope category increasingly competes with other forms of entertainment 
however  management believes that as the company introduces new and innovative products into the telescope markets some of which are slated for introduction during fiscal that demand for some of the company s products may be stimulated 
management believes that demand for the company s less expensive telescope and binocular products can be enhanced with new product introductions  targeted marketing and competitive pricing 
gross profit decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of percentage points 
the decrease in gross profit margin was largely due to over million in inventory write downs  most of which was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the company announced a restructuring that involved the closure of its manufacturing operations in irvine  california  where the company had been performing manufacturing and assembly of high end telescopes 
production previously done in irvine  california has now been transferred to the company s manufacturing facilities in tijuana  mexico 
in conjunction with this restructuring  the company determined that it would eliminate certain skus as a means of streamlining operations and increasing efficiency and at the same time determined that certain parts in inventory would not be physically moved to other locations and would be scrapped 
the write down of inventory was largely related to these decisions 
in addition  during the fiscal year  the company sold certain inventory at lower margins as part of the company s ongoing campaign to reduce inventory levels 
the company also experienced an increase in warranty claims for which it adjusted its reserve for warranties accordingly 
selling expenses decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of percentage points 
this decrease was largely due to lower headcount costs in both the sales and marketing groups of approximately million due to the company s restructuring  reduced spending for advertising and promotions of approximately million  and million of lower bad debt expenses 
the balance of the decrease was due to savings related to the facility consolidation that occurred in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased from million of net sales in fiscal to million of net sales in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to two factors 
first  compensation costs decreased million over the prior year due to the headcount reductions and the consolidation of facilities that occurred in fiscal and second  fiscal included approximately million in non recurring legal and accounting fees associated with the prior year s restatements of the company s consolidated financial statements  these costs did not recur in fiscal the balance of the decrease was due to other savings related to the facility consolidation that occurred in fiscal esop related expenses are non cash charges related to the company s common shares that reside within the esop that are allocated to participants 
changes in this expense are principally due to changes in the average market value of the company s common stock 
the non cash esop contribution expense may fluctuate as the number of shares allocated and the market value of the company s common stock changes 
research and development expenses increased slightly from approximately million in fiscal and to approximately million in fiscal  as the company continued to invest in new product development at a relatively constant rate 
at february   the company completed its evaluation of goodwill in accordance with sfas with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm 
the company revised its long term forecast due to certain asset sales  generally lower revenue and cash flow expectations due to the recessionary pressures facing the us economy and the discretionary nature of the company s products and other specific knowledge of some of its customer s plans for the coming year 
the analysis resulted in the company s determination that the goodwill associated with the meade us reporting unit was fully impaired 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million as of february  interest expense increased million due to higher debt balances and fees related to amendments to its domestic revolving line of credit 
the tax provision was million on consolidated pre tax losses of million for fiscal the tax provision relates almost exclusively to the company s distribution subsidiary located in germany 
the tax provision for fiscal was driven in part by a reduction in the company s tax rate in germany from to  which resulted in a revaluation of the company s deferred tax liabilities in germany 
in addition  during fiscal the company sold an excess building and land located in germany 
the deferred tax liability associated with the building and land was reversed through the tax provision in conjunction with the sale 
the company did not recognize any tax benefits on its domestic pre tax losses due to the uncertainty of realizing those benefits in accordance with sfas liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended february  were prepared assuming the company would continue as a going concern  however  the company s recurring losses and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern is a result of a declining sales trend  recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit and is subject to the company s ability to increase revenue  restructure the company by significantly reducing its cost structure and or consummating a strategic transaction 
the company incurred net losses of million and million in the years ended february  and february   respectively 
net sales during fiscal decreased approximately from fiscal levels 
for the fiscal year  sales were negatively affected by the loss of the discovery channel stores  which had been a key customer in fiscal during the year ended february   the company funded its operations principally by borrowing on its bank lines of credit  net proceeds of approximately million from a private placement of  shares of its common stock and by utilizing its cash on hand 
cash flow from operating activities was negatively affected principally by losses for the period and an increase in inventories 
the increase in inventories from the prior year is due to improvements in the company s supply chain of riflescope and foreign sourced and domestically produced telescopes  as well as new products 
the company had million in cash at february  compared with million at february  the company s cash is swept on a daily basis to pay down the company s bank lines of credit 
the company utilizes its availability on its bank lines of credit to fund operations 
availability under the us revolving loan which is subject to a borrowing base with standard advance rates against eligible accounts receivable and inventories at february  was approximately million 
during fiscal  operations used approximately million in cash  offsetting million in net proceeds from a private placement of  shares of the company s common stock and million of net borrowings on its bank lines of credit 
excluding the company s write down of approximately million  inventories increased approximately million due to the company s improvements in the company s supply chain of riflescope and foreign sourced and domestically produced telescopes  as well as the company s new products 
inventories at february  were million compared to million at february  the lowest level at a year end reporting period since february  overall inventory turns increased to times during fiscal compared with times during fiscal working capital requirements fluctuate during the year due to the seasonal nature of the business 
these requirements are typically financed through a combination of internally generated cash flow from operating activities and short term bank borrowings 
cash flow projections developed by management indicate the company believes that it will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to support current operations through fiscal the company continues to depend on operating cash flow and availability under its bank lines of credit to provide short term liquidity 
the company s us credit facility expires in september  is collateralized by substantially all of the domestic assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries and contains certain financial covenants including  but not limited to  minimum ebitda levels  minimum tangible net worth targets  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and certain limits on capital expenditures 
amounts outstanding under the us revolving loan bear interest at the bank s base rate or libor rate plus applicable margins at february  
on may   the company executed the eleventh amendment to amended and restated credit agreement the eleventh amendment 
the eleventh amendment made the following key changes to the us credit agreement extended the expiration date to september   reduced the facility to  adjusted the pricing grid based on the company s calculated fixed charge coverage ratio  removed the million reserve previously established in the fifth amendment  set minimum ebitda  tangible net worth and capital expenditure requirements measured on a rolling four quarter basis beginning with the quarter ending may  and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenants measured on a rolling four quarter basis beginning with the quarter ending on may   required payment of an intercompany loan to the company s european subsidiary in the amount of approximately  by not later than july   and established prepayment penalties 
the fee for the amendment was  upon execution of the eleventh amendment the company was in compliance with all of its bank covenants 
the company repaid its intercompany loan of approximately  in july during the quarter ended august   the company was not in compliance with the ebitda based restrictive covenant in the credit facility agreement 
on october   the company obtained a day waiver from its lender related to this covenant 
on november   the company executed the twelfth amendment to amended and restated credit agreement the twelfth amendment 
the twelfth amendment made the following key changes to the us credit agreement reduced the facility to million  adjusted the pricing grid based on the company s financial performance  established a million reserve against the borrowing base with provisions for a reduction in the reserve for meeting future covenants  set minimum ebitda  tangible net worth and capital expenditure requirements measured on a monthly basis for the next twelve months and a rolling four quarter basis thereafter and set minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenants measured on a rolling four quarter basis beginning in february  and allowed for inter company debt between the company and its european subsidiary subject to certain limits and conditions 
under the twelfth amendment  bank of america  na also waived the company s non compliance with the minimum ebitda covenant under the credit agreement as of august  as a result  the company became in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into the thirteenth amendment to amended and restated credit agreement  which modified the terms of intercompany debt between the company and its european subsidiary 
subsequent to fiscal the company sold its simmons  weaver and redfield sport optics brands for gross proceeds of million 
in connection with this sale  the company executed the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to amended and restated credit agreement  which released the security interest of bank of america  na s in the collateral that was sold 
these amendments had the effect of reducing the facility to million 
as of february  the company was in compliance with its financial covenants 
for reasons described above  the company received an opinion from its independent auditors raising substantial doubts about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
this constitutes a technical default under the us credit agreement 
while the company is working with its lender to amend the covenants and cure the default  there can be no assurance that such amendments will be made 
in the event the company s plans require more capital than is presently anticipated  or in the event the company requires amendments to the covenants or other terms and conditions of the credit agreement that it is unable to secure from its bank  additional sources of liquidity such as debt or equity financings will be required to meet its capital needs 
there can be no assurance that such additional sources of capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
however  management believes that operating cash flow  net proceeds from asset sales and bank borrowing capacity in connection with the company s business should provide sufficient liquidity for the company s obligations for at least the next twelve months 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company announced that the board of director s had formed a special committee that has engaged an investment bank to assist the company in exploring strategic alternatives 
subsequent to fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal  the company announced that it had sold its weaver and redfield sport optics brands for gross proceeds of million 
however  the review of strategic alternatives is continuing 
such alternatives may involve a financial restructuring of the company s capital structure or potentially the sale of all or a portion of the company 
at this time there can be no assurance that the company will be able to execute on any strategic alternatives 
capital expenditures  including financed purchases of equipment  aggregated million and million for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at february  in  the company s european subsidiary purchased a building for cash of approximately million approximately million at that date 
the approximately  sq 
ft building  located in rhede  germany  is being used as office and warehouse space 
in addition to an already existing long term loan with its bank european term loan no 
the european subsidiary obtained a million approximately million at february  long term loan commitment european term loan no 
toward the purchase of the building 
european term loan no 
bears interest fixed at with monthly principal payments due of approximately  approximately  usd at february  for ten years 
on september   the european subsidiary drew down the million european term loan no 
approximately million at that date 
the european subsidiary renegotiates the terms of its short term revolving lines on an annual basis 
currently  the european line is million approximately million at february  increasing to a maximum of million approximately million at february  during fiscal the line bears interest at euribor plus 
the aforementioned lines of credit are provided on the condition that the intercompany loan of million be repaid to the company s european subsidiary 
the company plans on repaying substantially all of the intercompany loan during the first two quarters of fiscal the european line of credit and term loans are collateralized by all of the principal assets of the subsidiary  are further collateralized by a guarantee from the us parent company in the amount of million approximately million at february   and require a minimum capitalization of million approximately million at february  at the subsidiary 
contributions to the company s employee stock ownership plan esop are accounted for as a contribution expense on the company s statement of operations and are accrued quarterly based upon the expected annual contribution amount 
as quarterly contributions are accrued  the corresponding number of shares is added to the weighted average common shares outstanding and unearned esop shares on the company s balance sheet are reduced 
the esop uses the contributions to repay amounts due on the esop loan 
the esop contribution expense is a net non cash charge which is added back to net income to arrive at cash flows provided by operating activities 
as the company makes these non cash contributions to the esop to fund the repayment of the esop loan  the company will realize cash tax savings equal to the product of the tax basis of the contributions  multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rates in effect at the time 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal and beyond
