risk factors 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts due to  among other things  the one of a kind nature of most of our contracts  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that revenue recognition is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period  which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can change the estimate of total contract revenue  cost and profit include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the failure of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the performance of subcontractors  unusual weather conditions  our productivity and efficient use of labor and equipment and the accuracy of the original bid estimate 
because we have a large number of contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without affecting overall profitability 
however  significant changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue from change orders on contracts that have been approved as to scope but not price  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount that we currently expect to recover from customers in relation to costs incurred by us for changes in contract specifications or designs  or other unanticipated additional costs 
revenue relating to change order claims is recognized only if it is probable that the revenue will be realized 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
to minimize increases in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors 
after we are advised that our bid is the winning bid  we enter into firm contracts with our materials suppliers and sub contractors  thereby mitigating the risk of future price variations affecting those contract costs 
such quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we therefore have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
the principal remaining risks under fixed price contracts relate to labor and equipment costs and productivity levels 
as a result  we have rarely been exposed to material price or availability risk on contracts in our contract backlog 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 

table of contents we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to finish uncompleted contracts 
our cost estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our contracts can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a large number of contracts of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a more significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather related delays  subcontractor performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the contract and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 
valuation of long term assets 
long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
in addition  we had goodwill with a value of approximately million at december   which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas the impairment testing required by sfas requires considerable judgment  and an impairment charge may be required in the future 
we completed our annual impairment review for goodwill during the th quarter of  and it did not result in an impairment 

table of contents income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  where necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
reflecting management s assessment of expected future operating profitability and expectation that the company would utilize all remaining net operating loss carry forwards nols  we eliminated our valuation allowance in we are subject to the alternative minimum tax amt 
because we are still utilizing our nols to offset taxable income  payment of amt results in a reduction of our deferred tax liability 
an ownership change  which may occur if there is a transfer of ownership exceeding of our outstanding shares of common stock in any three year period  may lead to a limitation in the usability of  or a potential loss of some or all of  the nols 
in order to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change occurring  our restated and amended certificate of incorporation  as amended  prohibits transfers of our common stock resulting in  or increasing  individual holdings in excess of of our common stock  unless such transfer is made by us or with the consent of our board of directors 
because the regulations governing nols are highly complex and may be changed from time to time  and because our attempts to prevent an ownership change from occurring may not be successful  the nols could be limited or lost 
we believe that the nols are currently available in full  however  and intend to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that they will remain available 
to the extent the nols become unavailable to us  our future taxable income and that of any consolidated affiliate will be subject to federal taxation  thus reducing funds otherwise available for corporate purposes 
although our nols do not expire until  if unused  we estimate that our deferred tax assets related to our nols will be fully utilized during after the expiration or utilization of our nols  we have available to us the excess tax benefit resulting from exercise of a significant number of non qualified in the money options amounting to million as of december  accordingly  because we will no longer have the significant offsets provided by the nols  a comparison of our future cash flows to our historic cash flows may not be meaningful 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 fin which establishes the criteria that an individual tax position must meet for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recorded 
adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations 
in august  our board of directors authorized management to sell our distribution business 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we determined in the third quarter of that the distribution business became a long lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation 
in october  we sold the distribution business to an industry related buyer for gross proceeds of approximately million 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale in of approximately  equal to  after taxes

revenues increased million  or  from to reflecting the effect of continued expansion of our construction fleet  addition of a concrete plant and addition of crews 
our workforce grew by year over year  and we purchased over million in property  plant and equipment  including that acquired in the purchase of rhb  within the twelve month period ending december  the increased revenue came strictly from the state market resulting from the company being the successful low bidder in the state market which was assisted by an improved bidding climate in due to a large state highway program and increased total funding in the dallas and houston areas 
the improvement in the weather in the fourth quarter offset much of the lower than expected revenue of the first three quarters of due to heavy rainfall during those months 
due to seasonality of the nevada market  the contracts of rhb had only a modest effect on revenues for the two months they were included in revenues 
contract receivables are directly related to revenues and include both amount currently due and retainage 
the increase of million in contracts receivable to million at december  versus is due to the increase in revenue for the year the days revenue in contract receivables is approximately days and days at december  and  respectively 
gross profit 
the improvement in gross profits in was due principally to the increase in revenues 
the slight margin reduction was attributable to a decrease of margin in backlog  due to poor weather for the first three quarters of the year  and an increase in sales from the state contracts which have historically had lower gross margin than municipal contracts 
state highway contracts generally allow us to achieve greater revenue and gross profit production from our equipment and work crews  although on average the gross margins on this work tend to be slightly lower than on our water infrastructure contracts in the municipal markets 
the lower margins reflect proportionally larger material inputs in the state contracts as we typically receive lower margins on materials than on labor 
partially offsetting the margin reduction was our ability to continue to redesign some jobs  achieve incentive awards and maintain good execution levels during dry weather 
due to the large number of contracts in different stages of completion and in different locations  it is not practical to quantify the impact of each of these matters on revenues and gross profit 

table of contents contract backlog 
the increase in contract backlog is related to the nevada acquisition where backlog was million at december  there was million included in our year end backlog on which we were the apparent low bidder and have subsequently been officially awarded these contracts 
historically  subsequent non awards of such low bids have not materially affected our backlog or financial condition 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  or g a  in was principally due to higher employee expenses  including an increase in staff  and higher professional fees 
despite these increases in g a expenses in support of our growing business  our ratio of g a expenses to revenue remained essentially unchanged from to  at 
operating income 
the increase in operating income resulted principally from the higher revenues and gross profits as discussed above 
interest income net of interest expense 
the interest income net of interest expense remained virtually unchanged from to given the high cash and short term investments maintained throughout the year and the offering completed in december a total of  of interest expense was capitalized as part of our office and shop expansion 
minority interest 
as discussed in part i  item business  on october   the company acquired a interest in rhb 
the minority interest s share of rhb s income before income taxes was  for the two months ended december  that was included in the consolidated results of operations 
income taxes 
income taxes increased due to increased income  the texas margin tax and increases in the statutory tax rate 
net income from continuing operations 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was the result of the various factors discussed above 
discontinued operations  net of tax 
discontinued operations for and represent the results of operations of our distribution business  which was operated by steel city products  llc

our revenue increase of million  or  from to included a substantial increase in revenues from state highway work of million  or  to million as we took advantage of the very strong bidding climate in this sector and the resultant increase in the proportion of state highway contracts in our backlog 
in particular  we saw a near tripling of revenues in the dallas market  where we won several major contracts in early  and also good growth in the san antonio market 
state highway contracts generally allow us to achieve greater revenue and gross profit production from our equipment and work crews  although on average the gross margins on this work are slightly lower than on our water infrastructure contracts in the municipal markets because of the cost of larger material inputs into the state contracts 
at the same time there was a decrease in our municipal revenues of million  or  to million due to a decrease in the market for large diameter water line infrastructure construction 
the overall revenue expansion was facilitated by an increase of over two hundred employees in  and a significant increase in our equipment fleet 
the increase was achieved despite a generally wetter year in in most of our markets than in  which adversely affected production rates  and the impact of some significant delays in starting certain contracts in the first three quarters of  which were due to factors outside our control 
gross profit 
the improvement in gross profits in was due principally to the increase in revenues  combined with the higher gross margins 
this margin improvement was attributable principally to a better margin mix in backlog resulting from the improved bidding climate since  and to efficiencies resulting from the higher revenue levels achieved in these factors overcame the negative impact on gross margins of the wetter weather in and the delay in starting certain contracts  as described above 
they also helped offset the downward pressure on gross margins arising from the increased percentage of state highway work  from in to in in both years  we achieved a number of incentive awards upon the successful completion of contract milestones 

table of contents backlog 
the million increase in backlog in reflected the on going broadening of our service platform and the generally good bidding environment in our markets  especially in the dallas fort worth area where our backlog expanded significantly during the year 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  or g a  in was principally due to higher employee expenses  including an increase in staff  increased stock based compensation expense resulting from our higher share price in  and higher legal and accounting fees 
despite these increases in g a expenses in support of the growing business  our ratio of g a expenses to revenue remained essentially unchanged from to  at 
operating income 
the increase in operating income resulted principally from the higher revenues and gross profits  which led to an increase in operating margin from to 
interest expense net of interest income 
in  we invested cash raised in our public stock offering on which we earned over million of interest 
in  we paid million of interest expense primarily on related party debt which was repaid in january from the proceeds of our public offering 
income taxes 
in  we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset following management s review of the likelihood that tax loss carryforwards would be substantially utilized in the future 
this resulted in an effective tax rate of in in  we recorded a more normal tax charge at of income 
net income from continuing operations 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was the result of the various factors discussed above 
effect of income tax benefits 
although we have had the benefit of significant nols  which offset most of our income from federal income taxes  we are required to reflect a full tax charge in our financial statements through an adjustment to the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain adjustments resulting from our recovery of the deferred tax asset are recorded in the income statement 
those adjustments resulted in a benefit of million in assuming an income tax rate of  and disregarding adjustments to our deferred tax asset and other timing differences  net income would have been million for so that  on a comparative basis  the income from continuing operations level of million for represents an increase of approximately 
similarly  basic and fully diluted earnings from continuing operations per common share for  reflecting an effective tax rate of  would have been and  respectively  for a reconciliation of reported income from continuing operations for and to net income as if a tax rate had been applied is set forth in the table below

discontinued operations for and represent the results of operations of our distribution business  which was operated by steel city products  llc 
the increase in the net income from discontinued operations was primarily due to increases in gross margins from in to in through the date of sale 

table of contents the distribution business was sold on october  we recorded proceeds from the sale of approximately million and paid million to retire the steel city products  llc revolving line of credit 
we recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of  and recorded  in income tax expense related to that gain 

table of contents historical cash flows the following table sets forth information about our cash flows for the years ended december   and year ended december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents at end of period net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations operating activities investing activities financing activities supplementary information capital expenditures working capital at end of period operating activities 
significant non cash items included in operating activities were depreciation and amortization  which totaled million  an increase of million from  which was million  an increase of million over  as a result of the continued increase in the size of our construction fleet  deferred tax expense was million in  an increase of million over we accelerate the depreciation of our fixed assets for tax purposes 
the significant additions to fixed assets in and increased our deferred tax liability and certain other timing differences are recorded in the income statement 
such tax expense in increased million over due to the increased depreciation and a reduction in the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset 
significant components of the changes in working capital are as follows contracts receivable increased by million in and million in  principally reflecting the revenue increase and related level of customer retentions  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by million in  while in there was an increase of million 
these changes principally reflect fluctuations in the timing and amount of mobilization payments to assist in the start up on certain contracts  trade payables increased by million in compared with a decrease of million in  reflecting an increase in our volume of business  and there was a decrease of million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in compared with an increase of million in these changes reflect timing differences as contracts progress 
investing activities 
expenditures to expand our construction fleet were million in compared with million in the much enlarged contract backlog required a significant expansion and upgrade of our fleet in and additionally  in october  we purchased a interest in rhb which we acquired for million in order to expand our construction operations into nevada 
in connection with the acquisition  we incurred million of direct costs of the acquisition 
in january  we purchased certain assets of rathole drilling  inc for million also in order to expand our construction capabilities 
in and  we invested a portion of the funds raised in our public sale of common stock in cash and cash equivalents and short term auction rate securities  respectively 

table of contents financing activities 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in and was principally due to the sale of common stock to the public in december and january  in which our net proceeds were approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  we received proceeds of approximately  and  in and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
funds received from the exercise of warrants by north atlantic smaller companies investment trust plc  or nascit  and the exercise of options by employees and directors totaled million during in and we used approximately million and million  respectively  to pay long term debt  which included payments on notes to related parties in and during  and  there were net increases in borrowings under the lines of credit of million  million and million  respectively  because capital expenditures  long term debt repayments and working capital requirements exceeded cash provided by operations 
liquidity the level of working capital for our construction business varies due to fluctuations in the levels of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings  the size and status of contract mobilization payments  levels of customer receivables and contract retentions  and the level of amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 
some of these fluctuations can be significant 
the significant increase in our working capital level in and has been an important element in enabling us to expand our bonding facilities and therefore to continue to bid on larger and longer lived projects 
the company believes that it has sufficient financial resources to fund its requirements for the next twelve months of operations 
sources of capital in addition to cash provided from operations  we use our revolving lines of credit to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
lines of credit we have a credit facility with comerica bank entered into on october  which replaced a similar million revolver that had been renewed in april the credit facility has a maturity date of october   borrowing capacity of million and is secured by all assets of the company  other than proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts which are pledged to our bond surety 
borrowings under the credit facility were used to finance the rhb acquisition  repay indebtedness outstanding under the revolver  and finance working capital 
at december   the aggregate borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were million  and the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the new credit facility was million  which reduces availability under the credit facility 
at our election  the loans under the new credit facility bear interest at either a libor based interest rate or a prime based interest rate 
the unpaid principal balance of each libor based loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
the pricing leverage ratio is determined by the ratio of our average total debt  less cash and cash equivalents  to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda that we achieve on a rolling four quarter basis 
the pricing leverage ratio is measured quarterly 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable libor margins will be  and  respectively 
interest on libor based loans is payable at the end of the relevant libor interest period  which must be one  two  three or six months 
the new credit facility is subject to our compliance with certain covenants  including financial covenants relating to fixed charges  leverage  tangible net worth  asset coverage and consolidated net losses 

table of contents the unpaid principal balance of each prime based loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to comerica s prime rate plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable prime margins will be  and 
the interest rate on funds borrowed under this revolver during the year ended december  ranged from to 
in december  comerica syndicated the credit facility with three other financial institutions under the same terms discussed above 
management believes that the new credit facility will provide adequate funding for the company s working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  including seasonal fluctuations at least through december  as discussed above  the credit facility contains restrictions on the ability to make distributions and dividends  incur liens and encumbrances  incur further indebtedness  guarantee obligations  dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party  incur negative income for two consecutive quarters 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  other debt mortgages 
in we completed the construction of a new headquarters building on land owned by us adjacent to our equipment repair facility in houston 
the building was financed principally through an additional mortgage of million on the land and facilities at a floating interest rate which at december  was per annum  repayable over years 
this mortgage is cross collateralized with a prior mortgage on the land and equipment repair facilities  which were purchased in  in the original amount of  repayable over years with an interest rate of per annum 
in addition  we have available to us a long term facility of up to million repayable over years to finance the expansion of our office building and maintenance facilities 
uses of capital contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our fixed  non cancelable obligations at december  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years amounts in thousands credit facility operating leases mortgages our obligations for interest are not included in the table above as these amounts vary according to the levels of debt outstanding at any time 
interest on our credit facility is paid monthly and fluctuates with the balances outstanding during the year  as well as with fluctuations in interest rates 
in interest on the credit facility and revolver was approximately  the mortgages are expected to have future annual interest expense payments of approximately  in less than one year   in one to three years   in four to five years and  for all years thereafter 

table of contents to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts  we generally obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures during were million  including property  plant and equipment acquired with the purchase of rhb  and during were million including the purchase of the rdi equipment  and consisted almost exclusively of expenditures to purchase heavy construction equipment 
in we expect that our capital expenditure spending will be less than the level 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosure about the information used to measure fair value 
the statement applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value accounting in any new circumstances 
in february  the fasb delayed the effective date by which companies must adopt the provisions of sfas the new effective date of sfas defers implementation to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

 business combinations sfas r 
this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
also  under sfas r  all direct costs of the business combination must be charged to expense on the financial statements of the acquirer at the time of acquisition 
sfas r  revises previous guidance as to the recording of post combination restricting plan costs by requiring the acquirer to record such costs separately from the business combination 
this statement is effective for acquisitions occurring on or after january   with early adoption not permitted 
the effect of sfas r on future financial statements cannot be determined at this time  however  had this statement been in effect for  the charge of million to additional paid in capital related to the acquisition of rhb would have instead been in the costs allocated to nets assets acquired  including goodwill  and million of direct costs related to such acquisition would have been charged to expense instead of being included in the costs of the acquisition 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes in fair value recognized in the results of operations 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas clarifies previous guidance on how consolidated entities should account for and report non controlling minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries 
the statement standardizes the presentation of non controlling interests for both the consolidated balance sheet and income statement 
the statement also standardizes the accounting for changes in a parent company s interest in a subsidiary for situations where the change results in a deconsolidation and for situations where it does not result in a deconsolidation 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year ending december   and all interim periods within that fiscal year  with early adoption not permitted 
when this statement is adopted by the company  the minority interest in rhb and any similar subsequent acquisitions will be a separate component of stockholders equity instead of a liability and earnings per common share will be segregated between eps per common share and eps of minority interest 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates are our primary sources of market risk 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness was at floating interest rates 
based on our average debt outstanding during  we estimate that an increase of in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  in
