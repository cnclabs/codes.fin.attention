item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is committed to leveraging our innovative signaling pathway drug technologies in seeking to create new medicines  primarily for cancer 
in expanding our drug development efforts in the field of cancer through our targeted cancer drug development platform  we are building upon our past experiences in targeting signaling pathways in the areas of cancer  neurological disease and cardiovascular disease 
we seek to conduct research programs both internally and through strategic collaborations 
our most advanced program is our hedgehog antagonist program that is under collaboration with genentech 
in january  genentech began a phase i clinical trial to test gdc  a systemically administered hedgehog antagonist  in cancers 
the primary objectives of the phase i clinical trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of gdc and to establish the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities 
in october  genentech notified us that these initial objectives were achieved and that genentech had initiated a phase i clinical trial expansion cohort to enroll additional patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma to assess preliminary signs of biological activity as well as to continue the accumulation of phase i safety data 
genentech has indicated that it expects to present more comprehensive phase i data at an upcoming scientific conference 
genentech also has indicated that it plans to initiate three phase ii clinical trials of gdc in  which include a phase ii trial in metastatic colorectal cancer during the first quarter of and trials in advanced basal cell carcinoma and in an undisclosed advanced solid tumor of epithelial origin during the second half of our internal drug development efforts are focused on our proprietary targeted cancer drug development platform 
this platform focuses on the development of single agent drug candidates targeting one or more molecular components within the signaling pathways associated with certain cancers 
these programs are primarily focused on developing a number of proprietary  small molecule  single agent  multi targeted inhibitor drug compounds  including cudc  the first drug candidate selected as a development candidate from this platform 
each proprietary compound is being designed to inhibit validated cancer targets  including the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr  heat shock protein hsp  epidermal growth factor her and in combination with inhibition of histone deacetylase  or hdac  which is a validated non kinase cancer target 
we are also seeking to use this platform to develop proprietary single agent  single target drug candidates for cancer indications  including an hsp inhibitor 
cudc  our lead drug candidate under internal development  is being designed as a first in class therapeutic to inhibit hdac  egfr and her in preclinical studies  we have demonstrated that cudc inhibits all three molecular targets resulting in the potent killing of a wide range of cancer cell lines that are representative of a variety of human cancer types  many of which have demonstrated resistance to various approved targeted agents 
we have been actively working toward our goal of filing an ind for cudc  and expect to do so early in the second quarter of in furtherance of the development of our targeted cancer drug development platform  since may  we have outsourced certain medicinal chemistry based research functions to a leading provider of such services in shanghai  china 
more recently  we have engaged another provider in beijing  china to perform certain biology based research functions 
we have developed these relationships with chinese providers to support our us operations and we are currently engaging a total of chemists and six biologists in china 

table of contents since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our strategic collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we believe that key drivers to our success will include our ability to successfully file an ind and advance cudc into clinical testing in advance the preclinical development of other small molecule cancer drug candidates that we are developing under our targeted cancer drug development platform  commence and complete clinical trials  both for our internally developed programs  our hedgehog small molecule antagonist program being studied in phase i clinical trials by our collaborator  genentech  and any future programs we may pursue in collaboration with others in the future  and successfully commercialize products on the basis of our and any current or planned collaborators drug development programs 
going forward  we intend to add clinical development and regulatory capacities in and we will seek to advance one or more of our proprietary multi targeted cancer programs into early stages of clinical testing 
we also plan to continue to seek corporate collaborators for the further development and commercialization of at least one of our multi targeted cancer programs from our targeted cancer drug development platform 
when evaluating potential collaborative opportunities  we plan to seek to retain significant rights and involvement or control in at least the early stages of clinical development 
strategic collaborations since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from collaborations and other research and development arrangements with third parties 
we are currently a party to a june collaboration with genentech relating to our hedgehog signaling pathway antagonist technologies and to an april collaboration with genentech relating to the wnt signaling pathway 
our current collaboration agreements are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog antagonist collaboration 
in june  we established a collaboration with genentech that included continued development of our systemically administered hedgehog antagonist drug candidates for the treatment of cancer 
genentech is a biotechnology company with broad expertise in the development of cancer therapeutics 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive  royalty bearing license  with the right to sublicense  to make  use  sell and import  small molecule and antibody inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway  for applications in cancer therapy 
we had responsibilities to perform certain funded preclinical research activities and  to the extent relevant  co fund clinical development costs for certain products 
genentech has primary responsibility for clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  genentech made up front payments of  which consisted of a  non refundable license fee payment and a payment of  in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
genentech also made license maintenance fee payments totaling  over the first two years of the collaboration 
we have entered into three amendments to the june collaboration agreement 
pursuant to the amendments  genentech increased its funded research commitment and extended its funding obligation through december as part of these amendments  genentech provided us with  in incremental research funding over the period from december to december all 
table of contents research funding ended in december  and we do not expect to receive additional future research funding from genentech or incur any material research costs related to this program 
in october  genentech filed an ind application for which we received a  cash payment 
assuming that genentech proceeds with three phase ii clinical trials in as planned  in connection with the treatment of the first patient in the phase ii colorectal cancer trial  we have the right to receive a  cash payment from genentech 
we also have the right to receive an additional  cash payment upon initiation of the phase ii testing of the undisclosed advanced epithelial solid tumor 
we have already received a  cash payment for the initiation of phase ii testing in advanced basal cell carcinoma 
genentech had determined that it was obligated to make this payment since the phase i clinical trial expansion cohort in advanced basal cell carcinoma  which was initiated in october  satisfied the criteria for a phase ii clinical trial under the parties collaboration agreement 
we are eligible to receive additional payments upon the achievement of further development milestones in this indication 
in addition to these payments  we will be eligible to receive cash payments from genentech only upon the achievement of additional specified clinical development objectives as well as royalties on product sales if any hedgehog systemic antagonist products are successfully developed and commercialized 
should the current drug candidate successfully continue its development into subsequent stages of clinical testing and regulatory approval  we would be eligible to receive additional cash milestone payments 
as a result of our licensing agreements with various universities  we are obligated to make payments to these university licensors when we receive certain payments from genentech 
to date  we have made an aggregate of  in such payments 
genentech wnt pathway collaboration 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech for discovery and development of small molecule compounds that modulate the wnt signaling pathway 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive royalty bearing license to make  use and sell the small molecule compounds that are modulators of the wnt pathway 
genentech paid us an up front license fee of  and has also funded  for research and development activities during the two year research term  which ended in march beginning april  genentech assumed further responsibility for any future development of this program 
genentech has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain research  development  clinical and drug approval objectives 
genentech has also agreed to pay us royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully commercialized 
if genentech does not advance drug candidates generated under this collaboration beyond the discovery research stage  we are not entitled to receive any future cash payments under this collaboration 
we can not predict whether genentech will continue to pursue the development of drug candidates under the agreement or whether any development objectives for which we may be entitled to a cash payment will be achieved 
stryker corporation bmp assignment and sale in december  we sold and assigned our bone morphogenetic protein  or bmp  technologies to stryker corporation 
under the agreement  stryker paid us  in exchange for the sale and assignment of all of our remaining bmp assets 
as a result of the transaction  stryker will assume all future costs subsequent to the december  effective date related to future development activities  as well as to the maintenance and prosecution of the patent portfolio 
under the terms of the agreements  we are entitled to contingent cash payments related to certain clinical development and sales objectives  if achieved 
we can not predict whether any development objectives under this agreement for which we may be entitled to a contingent cash payment will be achieved 
recent development wyeth pharmaceuticals on march   we announced that wyeth pharmaceuticals has decided that it will no longer pursue its development efforts on our hedgehog agonist program and will terminate its january collaboration 
table of contents agreement with us 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  we had licensed our hedgehog protein and novel small molecule hedgehog pathway agonists to wyeth 
wyeth paid us an up front license fee and provided research funding through february research efforts under the collaboration focused on the preclinical development of small molecule and protein hedgehog agonists  primarily for stroke and cardiovascular indications 
pursuant to the agreement  the collaboration will terminate on may  we intend to pursue other opportunities to enter into a new collaboration or licensing relationship with a third party relating to this technology 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  the timing of the receipt of payments from collaborators and the cost and outcome of any clinical trials then being conducted 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the second half of our ability to continue funding our planned operations is dependent upon the success of our current collaborations with genentech  our ability to successfully enter into one or more additional collaborations for our technologies  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other sources of financing 
a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth under part ii  item a risk factors 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our gross revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees 
for the year ended december   each of the following collaborators or former collaborators accounted for a portion of our total revenue as follows genentech   or  wyeth   or  and procter gamble   or 
wyeth s funding of five of our researchers concluded on february   and we currently have no third party funded research 
accordingly  for the majority of our programs under collaboration  our future revenues are limited to the amortization of previously received license payments from wyeth and strkyer  research funding from wyeth through the february research term  potential future cash payments  if any  that are contingent upon the successful completion principally of contractually defined development and regulatory approval objectives  and royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaboration 
in the future  we will seek to generate revenues from a combination of license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties resulting from strategic collaborations relating to the development of products that incorporate our intellectual property  and from sales of any products that we successfully develop and commercialize  either alone or in collaboration 
we expect that any revenues we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments  if any  to be received under our existing and any future strategic collaborations and license arrangements  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent that any are successfully commercialized 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel including stock based compensation expense for employee share based payments beginning january  research and development expenses also include the costs of supplies and reagents  outside service costs including medicinal chemistry  consulting  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in as compared to prior years as we continue to progress our drug product candidates under our targeted cancer drug development platform into clinical trials 
product candidate primary indication collaborator licensee status hedgehog systemic antagonist gdc small molecule cancer genentech phase i expansion cohort small molecule and antibody cancer genentech preclinical targeted cancer drug development platform cudc hdac  egfr  her inhibitor cancer internal development development candidate other targeted cancer programs cancer internal development preclinical hedgehog agonist stroke and cardiovascular disease on march   wyeth provided us with written notice that it intends to terminate this collaboration agreement on may  on the termination date  the licenses granted by us to wyeth shall terminate and we intend to pursue other collaboration or lecturing opportunities for this program 
in the chart above  phase i expansion cohort means that our collaborator is currently treating human patients in an expanded phase i clinical trial  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate the safety and biological activity of the compound being tested in a specific solid tumor type 
development candidate means that from our testing in several preclinical models of human disease of various compounds from a particular compound class  we have selected a single lead candidate for potential future clinical development and are seeking to complete the relevant safety  toxicology  and other data required to submit an ind application with the fda seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial 
preclinical means we are seeking to obtain evidence of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of human disease of one or more compounds within a particular class of drug candidates 
because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of any collaborators and licensors to successfully complete preclinical and clinical studies of these drug product candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs which may affect our and any collaborators future results  including the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or any collaborators  the results of future preclinical and clinical trials  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and 
table of contents the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our drug product candidates 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our research and development programs on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth above in part i  item a risk factors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
these expenses include stock based compensation expense for employee share based payments beginning january  other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
license fees and multiple element arrangements 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single 
table of contents unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
substantive milestone payments 
our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  
table of contents the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and  a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and therefore the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
reimbursement of costs 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
payments from curis as a vendor to a collaborator as a customer 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the provisions of eitf eitf addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and of probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 
deferred revenue 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
significant judgments are required in the application of revenue recognition guidance 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  by december  amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our operating plan as of december  and on our estimated performance periods under the collaboration in which we have recorded deferred revenues 
if our operating plan or our estimated performance period should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the twelve month period from january  through december  as of december   we have short term deferred revenue of  related to our collaborations 
as of december   we have no remaining long term deferred revenue related to our collaborations 

table of contents the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations in accounting for share based payments and had elected the disclosure only alternative under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  when options granted to employees had an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we also adopted the modified prospective transition method for recognizing expense 
we have recorded employee stock based compensation expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
employee stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended december  was recorded applying apb for the options outstanding as of december   we estimate that we will record approximately  to  in stock based compensation expense under sfas r in we expect that we will issue additional options in that will increase the amount of stock based compensation ultimately recognized 
the amount of the incremental employee stock based compensation expense attributable to employee stock options will depend primarily on the number of stock options issued to employees in  the fair market value of our common stock at the respective grant dates  and the specific terms of the stock options 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used a black scholes pricing model for a majority of our stock awards and  for a small subset of our awards that contained a market condition  a lattice model 
both of these models require the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price the expected term of the option the grant date price of our common stock the expected volatility of our common stock the expected dividends on our common stock  which we do not anticipate paying for the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term of the variables above  we believe that the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
approximately of the employee stock compensation expense recorded in the year ended december  relates to continued vesting of stock options that were granted prior to january  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  as filed with the sec 

table of contents upon adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur  and record compensation expense only for those awards that we ultimately expect will vest 
accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate for each of the quarterly periods in and this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary to reflect the actual forfeitures for the reporting period 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
long lived assets long lived assets consist of property and equipment  equity securities held in privately held companies and goodwill 
in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs related to property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
if it were determined that the carrying value of our other long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on application of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during  we initiated a realignment of our research programs  shifting our focus on later stage preclinical drug development programs and de emphasizing our earlier discovery research programs 
as a result  in we recorded an impairment charge of  related to certain of our equipment that was no longer used in our discovery or other programs 
in addition  we revised our estimates of the depreciable lives on the remaining equipment currently being used in our discovery research programs as a result of the conclusion of two of our discovery screening programs in late and early in march  our bmp small molecule screening agreement with centocor a johnson johnson subsidiary concluded in accordance with the terms of contract 
under the terms of the screening agreement  centocor maintained an option to exclusively negotiate a broader bmp screening agreement 
however  during the second quarter of  centocor notified us that it would not opt to negotiate a further bmp small molecule agreement 
the bmp small molecule screening program was the only remaining program utilizing the majority of our existing discovery screening equipment 
we determined that we would not fund the bmp small molecule program internally 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded additional property and equipment impairment charges of  because this discovery equipment could not be used on other ongoing programs 
in addition  the net proceeds of  from the sale of these impaired equipment was applied to our outstanding debt obligations with the boston private bank trust company 
we will continue to review our estimates of remaining useful lives related to assets currently being used on our remaining programs 
any future changes to the estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of december   we hold equity investments in two privately held former collaborators  aegera therapeutics and es cell international  or esi 
equity investments in privately held companies are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at cost  as adjusted for impairment 
on a quarterly basis  we re evaluate our investments in privately held companies to determine if the carrying values have been impaired 
during the year ended december   we determined that the carrying value of esi s stock recorded at our consolidated balance sheet was in excess of the fair value of the asset 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of  by writing down the carrying value of our investment in esi equity securities to from  to  in september  we were notified that aegera was trying to secure additional financing at a value that was significantly less than the current carrying value of aegera stock we had recorded 
we believed that the terms of aegera s planned financing adversely affected the carrying value of our equity investment in aegera 
as a result  during the third quarter of the year ended december   we wrote down the carrying value of our investment in aegera equity securities by  from  to  
table of contents we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually 
since january   we have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  and the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues are summarized as follows for the year ended december  percentage increase decrease revenues research and development contracts genentech wyeth procter gamble centocor spinal muscular atrophy foundation other subtotal license fees genentech wyeth procter gamble micromet subtotal substantive milestones gross revenues contra revenues from co development with genentech net revenue gross revenues decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the net decrease is due to decreases in research funding and substantive milestone revenues offset by an increase in license revenues 
the decrease in research and development contracts of  was the result of the conclusion of research funding in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of under four collaborations  including the conclusion of the research funding portion of our hedgehog and wnt collaborations with genentech  a sponsored research agreement with the sma foundation and a screening agreement with centocor 
the termination of research funding under these arrangements accounted for 
table of contents  of the decrease in research and development contract revenues 
in addition  during the first quarter of wyeth decreased from eight to five the number of our researchers supported by wyeth under our hedgehog agonist program 
all wyeth related research funding concluded in february as a result of the foregoing  we expect that revenues under our research and development contracts will continue to decline for license revenues increased  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the recognition of  in revenue under our june hedgehog antagonist collaboration with genentech 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we could not estimate the performance period related to our ongoing joint steering committee obligation under this collaboration and therefore deferred  in payments that we had received from genentech in prior years 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of changed facts and circumstances  we concluded that our joint steering committee performance obligation had become inconsequential and perfunctory to the agreement 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of we recorded as licensing revenues the  in previously deferred revenues as well as  from a contingent cash payment that we received in october in addition  we accelerated recognition of license fee revenue related to our september collaboration with procter gamble  since procter gamble terminated this collaboration effective november this termination resulted in a decrease in our estimated performance period under this collaboration  resulting in additional revenue of  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in license fee revenues under our june hedgehog collaboration with genentech and our september collaboration with procter gamble were partially offset by decreases in license fee revenues for two of our programs 
we recorded  in license revenue during under our april wnt collaboration with genentech  as compared to  for the prior year period 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recognized  in license fee revenue as part of a settlement agreement with a former collaborator  micromet 
we did not record any license fee revenue under this agreement in we also recorded  in substantive milestone revenue during the year ended december  under our june collaboration with genentech 
in addition  we did not record contra revenues for the year ended december  compared to contra revenues of  for the year ended december  on august   we ceased our participation in a co development arrangement with genentech of a basal cell carcinoma drug candidate pursuant to which we had been recording contra revenues

these previously funded programs decreased by  from the prior year period and included i the conclusion in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of of the research funding under our ongoing hedgehog antagonist and our wnt signaling pathway collaborations with genentech  ii the termination by procter gamble of a september hedgehog agonist collaboration agreement for hair loss  and iii the conclusion of a sponsored research agreement with the sma foundation and a bmp small molecule screening agreement with centocor  both to conduct discovery research activities 
spending on our collaborator funded program with wyeth decreased  as a result of fewer researchers supporting the respective program 
funding on this program concluded in february in accordance with the terms of the agreement  and we expect that we will not incur any material costs subsequent to february as wyeth notified us that it was terminating our collaboration effective may  stock based compensation expense also decreased  as a result of a decline in the grant date fair value of stock options issued in as compared to  which resulted in lower compensation expense 
as the research funding concluded on programs under collaboration and as we shifted our research focus  we reallocated certain of these resources to our internal targeted cancer drug development programs  including cudc  which we initiated in the first half of these programs accounted for  or  of our research and development expense compared to  for the same prior year period  an increase of  we expect that these cancer programs will consist of a majority of our ongoing future research and development expenses for the foreseeable future

these decreases included our receipt in of  in proceeds under an april settlement agreement entered into with a former subtenant that had defaulted on a sublease of our moulton street facility 
we recorded  of this amount as a reduction of expense 
in addition  our lease on our moulton street facility concluded on april   which reduced our overall occupancy costs 
professional and consulting services decreased  as a result of expenses incurred for the restatement of our prior financial statements during the first quarter of and costs incurred during associated with the formation of our chinese subsidiary  including technology evaluations and review of business development opportunities in china

other general and administrative costs are comprised of travel costs  temporary help  and computer and office supplies 
these costs increased  primarily due to increased travel costs and higher nasdaq filing fees resulting from our august private placement

the decrease resulted from lower outstanding debt obligations during the year primarily due to the conversion of a note payable to becton dickinson in january net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through license fees and research and development funding from our collaborators and licensors  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding restricted long term investments of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions and short term commercial paper 
we also maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances because the balances are invested in highly rated securities 
our marketable securities are investments with expected maturities of greater than three months  but less than twelve months  and consist of commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and government obligations 
the use of our cash flows for operations primarily consists of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees and legal fees 
to date  the primary source of our cash flows from operations has been payments received from our collaborators and licensors 
recently  however  a majority of our research and development effort and expense has shifted from our programs that are funded under collaborations relating to the hedgehog pathway and various discovery programs to the development of programs under our targeted cancer drug development platform 
while we are seeking a corporate collaborator for one or more of the programs in this platform  we are currently 
table of contents progressing the research and development of these programs on our own 
we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in as we expect to initiate phase i clinical testing for cudc  the first development candidate from our proprietary platform  as well as to select at least one additional development candidate from our proprietary platform during should we begin clinical evaluations of cudc or another of these drug candidates  we expect that our research and development costs would increase significantly in in general  our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments from new collaborations  if any  contingent cash payments for the achievement of development objectives  if any are met  and funded research and development that we may receive under collaboration agreements 
except for five researchers who were funded by wyeth through february   substantially all of our research staff is working on developing drug candidates from our targeted cancer drug development platform 
the timing of or entrance into any new collaboration agreements and any contingent cash payments under existing collaboration agreements are not assured  cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
potential future cash payments  if any  are contingent upon the successful completion principally of contractually defined development and regulatory approval objectives under existing collaboration agreements  and royalty payments are contingent upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaboration 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities affected operating cash during the year ended december   including a decrease in deferred revenue of  as a result of accelerated license fee amortization under our genentech and procter gamble collaborations 
offsetting this decrease  and increasing our cash position  our accounts receivables decreased  primarily related to our microment settlement  and our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased  finally  several noncash items further offset our net loss  including stock based compensation expense of  depreciation of  and impairment of assets of  cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  partially offset by non cash charges including stock based compensation of  and depreciation of  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities offset these increases in operating cash during year ended december  specifically  our accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased  primarily as a result of the cessation on august  of our co development arrangement with genentech and our deferred revenue decreased  as a result of license fee amortization under our various collaborations 
we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to research and develop our existing product candidates and advance our targeted cancer drug development platform programs through preclinical development and  we expect  into clinical development 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
investing activities used  of cash for the year ended december   resulting from  in net investment purchases primarily related to investment of funds received from our august private placement 
in addition  for the year ended december   we received  in net proceeds from the sale of certain of our assets used to pay down our outstanding principal obligations to the boston private bank trust company 
we currently do not expect to undertake any significant capital projects during investing activities generated cash of  for the year ended december   resulting from  in net investment sales offset by  in fixed asset purchases 

table of contents financing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from  received in issuances of common stock  including net proceeds of  from our august private placement of common stock and  received upon the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
offsetting these increases in cash  we repaid  of our term debt with the boston private bank trust company 
financing activities used  of cash for the year ended december   resulting from debt repayments of  on our notes offset by proceeds of  received upon stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
on august   we completed a private placement of units  each with a purchase price of per share and comprising one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock 
as a result  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
we intend to use the  in net proceeds from the private placement primarily to support our clinical and research and development efforts  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire on august  we can require the mandatory exercise of the warrants in the event that our stock closing price on nasdaq exceeds per share for a period of days 
we filed a resale registration statement in form s  which was declared effective by the sec on september   to register for resale the shares of common stock  and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants  held by the investors 
on march   we converted  financed under an amended loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company into a month term note that bears interest at a fixed rate of for the repayment period 
under the terms of the note payable  we are required to make equal monthly payments of  plus any accrued interest beginning on may  extending through april  unless the outstanding principal is paid in full earlier 
on december   we converted  financed under a separate loan agreement with the boston private bank trust company into a month term note that bears interest at a fixed rate of for the repayment period 
during the year ended december   we sold certain of our assets and lab supplies for which we received  in gross proceeds for the assets and  for lab supplies that were not collateralized by this note 
the total proceeds of  were remitted to boston private bank trust and were applied to the principal obligation outstanding under this loan agreement 
none of the terms of the loan were changed as a result of the sale of assets collateralized under this agreement 
under the terms of the note payable  we are required to make equal monthly payments of  plus any accrued interest beginning on january  extending through the repayment period  which is april after giving effect to the  in additional principal payments  which resulted from our sale of certain of our pledged assets during these loans are collateralized by all of our property and equipment assets  except for fixtures 
the loan collateral also excludes and property or equipment that are purchased after march  under purchase money arrangements with equipment lenders  however  we have not completed any such purchases 
as of december   we were in compliance with the sole covenant under each of these financing agreements 
the covenant requires us to maintain a minimum working capital ratio 
should we fail to pay amounts when due or fail to maintain compliance with the covenant under the agreements  the entire obligation becomes immediately due at the option of the boston private bank trust company 

table of contents contractual obligations in addition to our loan agreement with boston private bank trust company  we also have contractual obligations including an operating lease related to our facility  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by the period indicated at december  amounts in s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years debt obligations under note payable  including interest operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
these potential future obligations are not included in the above table 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   excluding any cash payments that are contingent upon the achievement of defined development objectives under our ongoing collaborations with genentech and our assignment agreement with stryker corporation  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into second half of we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials  for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue funding planned operations beyond second half of is dependent upon  among other things  the success of our collaborations  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also anticipate that we will seek to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
due to our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
additional financing may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  the sale of additional debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if substantial additional funding is not available  our ability to fund research and development and other operations will be significantly affected and  accordingly  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a further discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our current cash balances in excess of operating requirements are invested in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  generally money market funds and corporate debt securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because of the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would materially impair the principal amount of our investments 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income 
as of december   we held chinese yuan renminbi denominated assets on our balance sheet of  the underlying assets are expected to have a holding period of one year or less 
the value of these assets could fluctuate based on changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and chinese yuan renminbi 
we have not entered into any hedging agreements relating to this risk 
we do not believe that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material impact on the fair value of these assets or our net income loss
