the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  introduction we are an exploratory stage mining company  that is  we have option agreement on claims to numerous mining concessions in mexico  peru  argentina and chile 
we have not proven that they contain precious metals having commercial value 
both internally and using independent laboratories  we have conducted numerous tests on the surface assays and core samples from drilling 
comparison of operating results for the year ended june  as compared to june  revenues we are an exploratory mining company with no revenues from operations to date 
all of our revenues to date represent interest income which we have earned as a result of our cash holdings 
our cash holdings were generated from the sale of our securities 
interest income for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the year ended june  interest income since inception totaled  interest income increased significantly this past year as a result of the completion of our million financing 
these funds are deposited in an interest bearing account subject to transfer to our operating account to meet ongoing expenses 
we intend to utilize our cash reserves for ongoing exploration activities  land acquisitions and general working capital expenditures 
as a result  we anticipate a significant decline in our interest income absent a significant capital infusion 
operating expenses we incurred expenses totaling  and  for the year ended as compared to  an increase of approximately 
the significant increase in our expenses is primarily attributable to the exploratory costs and geology expenses 
other areas where we incurred significantly higher expenses were for professional fees  marketing  corporate communications and office and administrative expenses 
during our last fiscal year  we incurred exploratory costs of  professional fees of  geologist fees and expenses of  marketing fees of  and office and administrative expenses totaling  these fees compare to exploratory fees of  professional fees of  geologist fees and expenses of  marketing fees of  and office and administrative expenses of  for the year ended june  the significant increase in all of these expenses as well as the other expenses identified in our consolidated statement of operations is the result of increased exploratory costs  costs incurred with respect to the acquisition of mineral properties as well as increased costs incurred with respect to the oversight of these operations 
we continue to rely on stock based compensation 
however  during our latest fiscal year stock based compensation declined from  to  shares were issued for services rendered and to be rendered by consultants 
in addition we issued shares of our common stock to our directors for services rendered for serving on the company s board of directors 
additional shares of common stock were issued in lieu of services rendered 
we also issued shares of our common stock valued at  for the acquisition of mineral properties in as compared to  in the value of the common stock was determined based upon the closing bid price of our common stock on the date of grant 
net income loss our net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net loss of  in our prior year 
our net loss per share was as compared to a net loss per share of for the comparable periods in the decline in our net loss per share is directly attributable to an increase in the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for was  as compared to  for until such time as we are able to identify mineral deposits which we believe can be extracted in a commercially reasonable manner  of which there can be no assurance  we anticipate that we will continue to incur ongoing losses 
liquidity and capital resources assets and liabilities at june  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  as compared to  as of june  the significant decrease in our cash reserves is directly attributable to expenses we have incurred since the completion of our primary financing in march amounts receivable totaled  as compared to  and prepaid expenses and deposits totaled  as compared to  we had total current assets of  as compared to our mineral properties were valued as of june  at  as compared to  the increase in the value of our mineral properties this past year is directly attributable to an increase in the size of our holdings 
see footnote we also have a long term receivable of  which is non redeemable until may  and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
fixed assets totaled  as compared to  our long term assets at june  totaled  as compared to  as of june  total assets as at june  were  as compared to  as at june  the primary reason for this significant drop in our total assets is a decline in our cash position 
our current liabilities as of june   as compared to  as of june  the significant increase in our accounts payable is primarily attributed to drilling costs 
we have a working capital surplus of  as compared to a working capital surplus of  as of june  unless we receive a significant cash infusion from either debt or equity financing  of which there can be no assurance  we will have to significantly reduce our drilling and land acquisition programs during the upcoming year 
results of operation for the year ended june  with respect to our short term liquidity  our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities as of june  was as compared to as of june  the current ratio is a commonly used as a measure of a company s liquidity 
our management believes  however  that with a company still in the exploratory stage  the ratio may not be as significant as with an ongoing business in comparing the company with others in the industry 
in analyzing our liquidity  we look at actual dollars  we compare our cash on hand and other short term assets with our bills payable and other short term obligations 
since our only source of funds has been from the periodic sale of securities  it will be very difficult for us to meet our current and anticipated obligations for a significant period of time without raising additional capital 
if we are not able to raise adequate capital and to do so in a timely manne r  we will not be able to fully implement our business plan or sustain ongoing operations 
if and when we are able to begin production  which is highly uncertain  we will make an evaluation to determine whether cash reserves should be established or other steps taken to minimize possible adverse consequences due to environmental matters 
such evaluation will consider  among other factors  the land or other sources from which the raw materials are taken and the land upon which the processing is done  the nature of any chemicals used in the processing  and the nature  extent  and means of disposition of the residue from the processing 
since our inception  we have funded our activities by issuing stock 
although we will continue periodically to seek external sources of funds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations 
if we do raise equity capital  depending on the number of shares issued and the issue price of the shares  current shareholders interests may be diluted 
the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes that the company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business 
the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company s ability to generate profitable operations in the future  to maintain adequate financing  and to achieve a positive cash flow 
there is no assurance it will be able to meet any or all of such goals 
andean gold alliance peru we have terminated our agreement with teck cominco and written off the asset known as the andean gold alliance 
we have also terminated our drilling program in peru as we have not been able to identify viable precious metal deposits 
plan of operation exploration our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to focus our exploratory efforts on the san miguel groupings 
it is very difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty the extent of our drilling program for unless we receive additional financing or enter into some type of joint venture agreement whereby exploratory expenses will be borne by both parties  we will have to significantly reduce our exploratory program to preserve capital 
further exploration programs will also be dependent upon drill rig availability and weather 
at june  we had two drill rigs active at the property 
however  we have since returned both drill rig pending further assay results in an attempt to maximize further drilling opportunities and identify a proven reserve 
in order to enhance shareholder value  increase the number of mineral concessions which we own and to further increase the likelihood of identifying a joint venture partner we have entered into an agreement with tara gold resources corp 
tara gold to acquire all of the remaining equity ownership of the joint venture previously entered into between the parties on february  in consideration for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest owned by tara gold resources corp 
in the joint venture  paramount will issue to tara gold a total of  shares of its legended common stock 
in addition  assuming the closing of the transaction  all invoices previously submitted by paramount for tara gold s contribution to the exploration and development of the san miguel property which totaled  as of june  will be cancelled 
in addition to the issuance of the shares of our common stock  we wil l pay to tara gold for the transfer of the mining concessions a total of  mxn 
closing of the transaction will be subject to approval of the stock issuance by both the american stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange as well as registering the transaction with the bureau of mines in mexico 
in the event that this transaction does not close  a total of  was due from tara gold as of june  these expenses represent tara gold s proportionate contribution to the joint venture 
as collection is not reasonably assured  as of june   we have not recorded amounts receivable from tara gold 
any amounts recovered will be recorded as a recovery of exploration expenditures in the period received 
in addition to the tara gold acquisition  on june  we signed a letter of intent with garibaldi resources corp 
for grant of an option and joint venture to acquire approximately  hectares of property adjoining our san miguel interest 
we have made an initial  payment under this agreement 
in order to earn a interest  we will be required to make an additional payment of  issue  shares of our common stock and spend  in exploration expenses 
there are also provisions in the letter of intent which give us the opportunity to increase our interest in the joint venture to 
the foregoing will be subject to execution of a definitive agreement 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission the sec  encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
use of estimates management s discussion and analysis or plan of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long lived assets 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and according to the provision of statement of financial accounting no 
sfas  accounting and reporting for development stage enterprises  as it were devoting substantially all of its efforts to acquiring and exploring mineral properties 
it is industry practice that mining companies in the development stage are classified under generally accepted accounting principles as exploration stage companies 
until such properties are acquired and developed  the company will continue to prepare its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with entities in the exploration or development stage 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
under the modified prospective method  we are required to recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
for periods prior to adoption  the financial statements are unchanged  and the pro forma disclosures previously required by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 will continue to be required under sfas no 
r to th e extent those amounts differ from those in the statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements during the next months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure 
our major commodity price risk exposure relates to the then current market value of any silver or gold reserves which we choose to exploit 
a dramatic drop in the price of gold or silver would make commercial exploitation of any of our properties less likely than if prices remained at their current level 
we are also subject to currency fluctuations between the united states  mexico and canada 
we do not plan on entering into any hedging transactions 
rather  management will continue to evaluate the market risks and address these issues should they become material to the company s ongoing operations
