item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction 
fonar was formed in to engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling mri scanners 
in  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  health management corporation of america  also referred to as hmca  formerly known as us health management corporation  in order to expand into the physician and diagnostic management services business 
fonar s principal mri products are its stand up r upright r mri and fonar tm mri scanners 
the stand up r mri allows patients to be scanned for the first time under weight bearing conditions 
the company has been aggressively seeking new sales 
the stand up r mri is the only mri capable of producing images in the weight bearing state 
at tesla field strength  the upright r mri and fonar tm magnets are among the highest field open mri scanners in the industry  offering non claustrophobic mri together with high field image quality 
fonar s open mri scanners were the first high field strength mri scanners in the industry 
hmca commenced operations in july  and generates revenues from providing comprehensive management services  including development  administration  accounting  billing and collection services  together with office space  medical equipment  supplies and non medical personnel to its clients 
revenues are in the form of fees which are earned under contracts with mri facilities and physical rehabilitation practices 
since april  hmca has not engaged in the management of primary care medical practices 
since july  hmca has engaged only in the management of mri facilities  having sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation practices 
for the fiscal years ended june   june   and  respectively  of hmca s revenues were derived from contracts with facilities and practices owned by dr 
raymond v 
damadian  the president of fonar and hmca and principal stockholder of fonar 
the agreements with the mri facilities are for one year terms which renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated 
the fees for fiscal were based on the number of procedures performed and ranged from to per mri scan 
commencing with fiscal  the mri facilities were charged a flat fee  pursuant to new contracts executed in connection with the sale of the mri facilities by dr 
raymond damadian to dr 
robert diamond at the end of fiscal the fees will be reviewed and if appropriate  adjusted on an annual basis by mutual agreement 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue from sales contracts for our mri scanners  under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize revenue and related costs of revenue  as each sub assembly is completed 
amounts received in advance of our commencement of production are recorded as customer advances 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our deferred tax assets to equal our deferred tax liability 
we amortize our intangible assets  including patents  purchased management agreements and capitalized software development costs  over the shorter of the contractual legal life or the estimated economic life 
our amortization life for patents and capitalized software development costs is to years and years  respectively 
we periodically assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and management agreements  when there are indications of potential impairment  based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of impairment is calculated by comparing anticipated discounted future cash flows with the carrying value of the related asset 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  and future prospects  in addition to other economic factors 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a net loss of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represents an increase in revenues of 
this was due mostly to increased unrelated party sales and service revenues  which increased by and respectively 
related party product sales and management fees decreased by and respectively 
in addition  total cost and expenses decreased by 
in fiscal and the beginning of fiscal we have made significant cuts to reduce losses and negative cash flow 
our consolidated operating results improved by million to an operating loss of million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  with product sales revenues remaining constant at million in fiscal and fiscal  but service revenue increasing by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in sales of our upright r mri to unrelated parties and increased service revenues  notwithstanding the decrease in related party sales 
we attribute the lower sales volumes in fiscal and primarily to a concern on the part of potential customers about mri scan reimbursements from medical insurance  no fault insurance  worker s compensation and federal and state programs  most significantly medicare and medicaid 
even in our own management of mri facilities by hmca  we have noticed an increasing resistance to paying claims by insurers 
also of concern is the deficit reduction act which is reducing medicare funding available for mri imaging 
we anticipate an improvement in our upright r mri sales because the upright r mri is unique in that it permits mri scans to be performed on patients upright in the weight bearing state and in multiple positions that correlate with symptoms 
an important event in our ongoing effort to educate both the medical community and payors about the benefits  if not necessity  of utilizing upright r mri scanning  occurred in fiscal when we sold an upright r mri scanner to the largest orthopedic hospital in the netherlands  st 
maartenskliniek 
upon placing the order  the chairman of spine surgery at st 
maartenskliniek expressed the view that for their hospital to continue to engage in spine surgery without fonar s upright r mri technology  now that it was available was unacceptable and that owning the scanner was not optional  but mandatory 
he further stated that once our active research program has discovered the benefits of this new fonar technology for patients  we intend to publish the results in a lot of peer reviewed scientific journals 
in addition  significant progress is being made in developing the fonar tm mri scanner so that it can be used in interventional procedures 
at the oxford nuffield site in the united kingdom  where we installed the first fonar tm mri  fonar software engineers have completed and installed our nd generation tracking software  which is designed to enable the surgeons to insert needles into the patient and accurately advance them under direct visual image guidance to the target tissue  such as a tumor  in order to inject therapeutic agents directly into the tissue 
the increase in service revenue is a result primarily of our increase scanner base  as scanners sold in previous years become service customers after the warranty period expires 
product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties decreased by in fiscal from  in fiscal to in fiscal we believe that one of our principal challenges in achieving greater market penetration is attributable to the better name recognition and larger sales forces of our larger competitors such as general electric  siemens  hitachi  philips and toshiba and the ability of some of our competitors to offer attractive financing terms through affiliates  such as ge capital 
nevertheless  no other competitor offers a whole body weight bearing mri scanner such as the upright r mri  and the general electric medical systems division of general electric acts as a manufacturer s representative for the stand up r mri 
we believe that our aggregate product sales to unrelated parties of upright r scanners shows that we are successfully meeting that challenge 
the operating results for the medical equipment segment improved by million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this improvement is attributable most significantly to an increase in service revenue and to an increase in our scanner sales 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our upright r mri scanners in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of upright r mri scanners 
sales of mri scanners to related parties  consisting of professional corporations and other entities in which dr 
damadian or members of his family have an interest  represented none of our revenues in fiscal  as compared to  or  of our revenues in fiscal we believe concerns about payor reimbursements adversely affected these sales as well as sales to unrelated parties 
license and royalty revenue in fiscal increased to million as compared to in fiscal research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  decreased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse tm and new surface coils to be used with the stand up r mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues reflects a change in management fees charged from a per procedure charge to a flat fee on of the mri centers 
this was offset by a reduction of income in the mri center located in orlando  florida in which hmca sold its partnership interest in july hmca manages only mri facilities 
presently  of the mri facilities managed by hmca have upright r mri scanners and additional upgrades are planned 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment decreased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  this resulted from our inability to benefit from reduced costs per scanner that would have resulted if there had been a higher volume of sales in fiscal operating results of this segment improved from an operating loss of million in fiscal to operating loss of million in fiscal we attribute the improvement to a slight increase in revenue along with a decrease in our cost of revenues 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal interest and investment income decreased in compared to we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing an decrease of 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
notwithstanding that revenue increased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compensatory element of stock issuances also decreased from approximately  in fiscal to in fiscal this reflected fonar s decision not to use its stock bonus plans to pay employees and others  in order to prevent dilution of its outstanding stock 
the higher provision for bad debt of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  reflected an increase in reserves of certain indebtedness by our physician and diagnostic services management segment 
service and repair fees also have steadily increased  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal continuing our tradition as the originator of mri  we remain committed to maintaining our position as the leading innovator of the industry through aggressive investing in research and development 
in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our new mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development   of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment  and of total revenues  in and of medical equipment segment revenues  and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a decrease in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues decreased  from million in fiscal to in fiscal and then to million in fiscal this is primarily attributable to the sale of hmca s physical therapy and rehabilitation facility management business  which had generated revenues of million in fiscal we have been taking steps to improve hmca revenues by closing unprofitable facilities and continuing our program of replacing the mri scanners at the mri facilities we manage with upright r mri scanners and opening new facilities equipped with upright r mri scanners 
marketing expenditures are likely to increase  as the company continues its efforts to promote sales 
in the beginning of fiscal  in july of  hmca sold the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities to health plus management services  llc for a purchase price of million  payable pursuant to a promissory note payable in monthly installments 
the first twelve installments were interest only and the remaining payments were to consist of equal installments of principal and interest in the amount of  each 
the note was secured by a first lien on all of the assets of health plus  including its accounts receivable 
the note was subject to prepayment provisions to the extent health plus resells all or part of the assets and business or utilizes the assets sold as collateral in any debt financing 
pursuant to a modification agreement dated august   health plus made a prepayment of  on the note and received a discount of  in return 
a new note was executed for the balance of the indebtedness remaining  in the amount of  providing for consecutive equal monthly payments of principal and interest of  each 
the security agreement and the mandatory prepayment provisions applicable to the original note are also applicable to the replacement note 
hmca had recognized revenue from the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities of approximately million during both fiscal and  but only  in fiscal due to the sale of this portion of hmca s business in july  in fiscal and  hmca received no revenue from the physical therapy and rehabilitation business 
hmca recognized a diminimus loss during the quarter ended september  in addition  hmca recorded a one time charge to earnings during the quarter ended september  of million related to the termination of the employment contracts of the two principal individuals involved in the management of the physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced net loss of million on revenues of million  as compared to a net loss of million on revenues of million for fiscal this represented an increase in revenues of 
this was due mostly to increased unrelated product sales and service revenues which increased by and respectively 
related party product sales and management fees decreased by and respectively 
in addition  total cost and expenses decreased by only 
we were reluctant at the time to make drastic cuts because we anticipated that our sales results would improve and we wanted to maintain our manufacturing capacity 
our consolidated operating results improved by million to an operating loss of million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal discussion of operating results of medical equipment segment fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting an increase in product sales revenues of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and an increase in service revenue of  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline in revenues was attributable to a reduction in sales of our upright r mri 
the increase in service revenue was a result primarily of our increased scanner base  as scanners sold in previous years became service customers after the warranty period expired 
product sales to unrelated parties increased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales to related parties decreased by in fiscal from million in fiscal to  in fiscal the operating results for the medical equipment segment improved by million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal this improvement was attributable most significantly to an increase in service of revenue and an increase in our scanner sales 
we recognized revenues of million from the sale of our upright r mri scanners in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized revenues of million from the sale of upright r mri scanners and the balance of  from the sale of our first fonar tm mri scanner 
sales of mri scanners to related parties  consisting of professional corporations and other entities in which dr 
damadian or members of his family have an interest represented approximately  or  of our revenues in fiscal  as compared to  or million  of our revenues in fiscal we had no license and royalty revenue in fiscal and fiscal research and development expenses  net of capitalized costs  decreased by to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our expenses for fiscal represented continued research and development of fonar s scanners  fonar s new hardware and software product  sympulse r and new surface coils to be used with the upright r mri scanner 
discussion of operating results of physician and diagnostic services management segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues attributable to the company s physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues reflected decreases resulting from sale of hmca s physical therapy and rehabilitation facility management business and delayed collections 
following the sale  hmca managed only mri facilities 
cost of revenues as a percentage of the related revenues for our physician and diagnostic services management segment increased from million or of related revenues for the year ended june  to million  or of related revenue for the year ended june  this resulted from our inability to benefit from reduced costs per scanner that would have resulted if there had been a higher volume of sales in fiscal operating results of this segment declined from an operating loss of million in fiscal to an operating loss of million in fiscal we attributed the decline to hmca s sale of its physical therapy and rehabilitation facility management business 
discussion of certain consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized interest income of  in as compared to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
interest expense of  was recognized in fiscal increasing from  in fiscal and representing a increase of 
the increase was attributable primarily to new capital lease obligations 
notwithstanding that revenue decreased by  selling  general and administrative expenses  exclusive of compensatory element of stock issuances  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in compensatory element of stock issuances from approximately million in fiscal to  in fiscal reflected the continued but reduced use of fonar s stock bonus plans to pay certain highly compensated employees and others in stock rather than in cash 
the higher provision for bad debt of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  reflected an increase in reserves and write offs of certain indebtedness by our physician and diagnostic services management segment 
service and repair fees also increased  as reflected by the increase in service and repair fees from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal we continued our investment in the development of our mri scanners  together with software and upgrades  with an investment of  in research and development   of which was capitalized  as compared to   of which was capitalized  in fiscal the research and development expenditures were approximately of revenues attributable to our medical equipment segment  and of total revenues  in and of medical equipment segment revenues  and of total revenues in fiscal this represented a decrease in research and development expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal the physician and diagnostic services management segment  hmca  revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was primarily attributable to the sale by hmca of the portion of its business engaged in the management of physical therapy and rehabilitation facilities in july of to health plus management services  llc liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by from million at june  to million at june  marketable securities approximated million as of june   as compared to million as of june  at june   we decreased our investments in us government obligations from approximately  at june  to approximately  decreased our investments in corporate and government agency bonds from approximately million at june  to approximately million and decreased our investments in certificates of deposits  notes and equivalents from  at june  to cash used in operating activities for fiscal approximated million 
cash used in operating activities was attributable substantially to the net loss of million and an increase in customer advances of million and an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of million  offset by an increase in accounts and management fee receivable of million 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal approximated million 
the principal uses of cash from investing activities were purchases of property and equipment of  costs of capitalized software development of  and costs of patents and copyrights of  the principal source of cash provided by investing activities was the proceeds of approximately million from the sale of a consolidated subsidiary 
cash used in financing activities for fiscal approximated  the principal sources of cash in financing activities were proceeds from the long term debt of  and proceeds of  from repayment of notes receivable from employee stockholders  offset by the repayment of borrowings and capital lease obligations of  and distributions to holders of minority interests of  total liabilities increased by during fiscal  from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  the increase in total liabilities reflected principally an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of from million at june  to million at june  and a increase in customer advances of from million at june  to million at june   resulting from our increased backlog 
our contractual obligations and the periods in which they are scheduled to become due are set forth in the following table contractual due in less due in due in due after obligation total than year years years years long term debt    capital lease obligation     operating leases  total cash obligations  as at june   our obligations included approximately million in various state sales taxes 
at june   however  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million as compared to a working capital deficit of million at june  and a stockholders deficiency of million at june  as compared to a stockholders equity of million at june  for the year ended june   we incurred a net loss of million  which included non cash charges of approximately million 
our principal source of liquidity has been derived from revenues  as well as cash provided by previous debt and equity financing 
in addition we have funded our cash flow deficit for fiscal through cash provided by the sale of marketable securities  other assets and debt financing 
in july  we sold our interest in a consolidated subsidiary and our interest in a non consolidated subsidiary  and received proceeds of approximately million 
effective september   subsequent to the end of fiscal  a wholly owned subsidiary of hmca sold its equity interest in an entity providing management services to a scanning center in bensonhurst  new york for approximately million 
in august  the company entered into a modification agreement with regards to the asset purchase agreement with health plus management services  llc 
the company received a  payment on the note issued by health plus 
our business plan includes an aggressive program for manufacturing and selling our upright r mri scanners 
in addition  we are enhancing our revenue by participating in the physician and diagnostic services management business through our subsidiary  hmca and are upgrading the facilities which it manages  most significantly by the replacement of existing mri scanners with new upright r mri scanners 
presently  of the mri facilities managed by hmca  are equipped with upright r mri scanners 
our business plan also calls for a continuing emphasis on providing our customers with enhanced equipment service and maintenance capabilities and delivering state of the art  innovative and high quality equipment upgrades at competitive prices 
fees for on going service and maintenance from our installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  in order to reduce our net losses and demands on our cash and other liquid reserves  we instituted an aggressive program of cost cutting during and following the end of fiscal these measures included consolidating hmca s office space with fonar s office space  reductions in the size of our workforce  compensation and benefits  as well as across the board reduction of expenses 
the cost reductions were intended to enable us to withstand periods of low volumes of mri scanner sales  such as we have experienced in fiscal and  by keeping expenditures at levels which  if necessary  can be supported by service revenues and hmca revenues 
the effect of these measures will be reflected for the most part in fiscal and are for the most part not reflected in the results for fiscal and estimates that the annualized savings related to these cost cutting measures approximates million 
we are also seeking equity and debt financing and have been engaged in discussions with several possible sources 
although sales levels remained weak in fiscal  we are continuing to focus our efforts on increased advertising and marketing campaigns  and distribution programs to strengthen the demand for our products and services 
management anticipates that fonar s capital resources will improve if fonar s mri scanner products gain wider market recognition and acceptance resulting in increased product sales 
if we are not successful with our marketing efforts to increase sales and weak demand continues  we will experience a shortfall in cash  and it will be necessary to further reduce operating expenses in a manner or obtain funds through equity or debt financing in sufficient amounts to avoid the need to curtail our operations subsequent to june  current economic credit conditions have contributed to a slowing business environment 
given such liquidity and credit constraints in the markets  the business may suffer  should the credit markets not improve in the near future 
the direct impact of these conditions is not fully known 
however  there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure additional funds if needed and that if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
in such case  the reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to generate positive cash flow to sustain our operations 
if we are unable to meet expenditures with revenues or financing then it will be necessary to reduce expenses further  or seek other sources of funds through the issuance of debt or equity financing in order to conduct operations as now conducted subsequent to fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal approximated  capitalized software costs were  and capitalized patent costs were  fonar has not committed to making capital expenditures in the fiscal year other than its plans to continue research and development expenditures at current levels 
we believe that the above mentioned financial resources  anticipated cash flows from operations and potential financing sources  will provide the cash flows needed to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support our operations
