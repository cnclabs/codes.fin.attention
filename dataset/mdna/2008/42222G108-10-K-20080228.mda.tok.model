managed health care operations we offer a full spectrum of managed health care products and services 
our strategy is to offer to employers and individuals a wide range of managed health care products and services that  among other things  provide comprehensive coverage and manage health care cost increases 
our health plans offer members a wide range of health care services including ambulatory and outpatient physician care  hospital care  pharmacy services  behavioral health and ancillary diagnostic and therapeutic services 
our health plans include a matrix package  which allows members to select their desired coverage from a variety of alternatives 
our principal commercial health products are as follows hmo plans our hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally through contracts with participating network physicians  hospitals and other providers 
when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans  he or she may select a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network 
pcps generally are family practitioners  general practitioners or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care  and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services  including making referrals to participating network specialists 
we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co payments that result in different levels of premium rates 
in california  participating providers are typically contracted through medical groups 
in those cases  enrollees in hmo plans are generally required to secure specialty professional services from physicians in the group  as long as such services are available from group physicians 
ppo plans our ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider  with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and co payments or coinsurance 
indemnity plans our indemnity plans offer the member the ability to select any health care provider for covered services 
some care management features may be included in these plans  such as inpatient precertification  disease management programs and benefits for preventive services 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and coinsurance 
pos plans our pos plans blend the characteristics of hmo and indemnity plans 
members can have comprehensive hmo style benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower co payments particularly within the medical group  but also have coverage  generally at higher co payment or coinsurance levels  for services received outside the network 
over the past five years  we have expanded all of our product lines  which has enabled us to offer greater flexibility to employer groups and individual insureds

the pricing of our products is designed to reflect the varying costs of health care based on the benefit alternatives in our products 
we provide employers and employees the ability to select and enroll in products with greater managed health care and cost containment elements 
in general  our hmos provide comprehensive health care coverage for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member 
ppo enrollees choose their medical care from a panel of contracting providers or choose a non contracting provider and are reimbursed on a traditional indemnity plan basis after reaching an annual deductible 
pos enrollees choose  each time they receive care  from conventional hmo or indemnity like in network and out of network coverage  with payments and or reimbursement depending on the coverage chosen 
we assume both underwriting and administrative expense risk in return for the premium revenue we receive from our hmo  pos and ppo products 
we have contractual relationships with health care providers for the delivery of health care to our enrollees in each product category

the primary care physicians and ppgs assume overall responsibility for the care of members 
medical care provided directly by such physicians includes the treatment of illnesses not requiring referral  and may include physical examinations  routine immunizations  maternity and childcare  and other preventive health services 
the primary care physicians and ppgs are responsible for making referrals approved by the hmo s or ppg s medical director as required under the terms of our various plans to specialists and hospitals 
certain of our hmos offer enrollees open access plans under which members are not required to secure prior authorization for access to network physicians in certain specialty areas  or open panels under which members may access any physician in the network  or network physicians in certain specialties  without first consulting their primary care physician 
ppo plans generally do not require prior authorization for specialty care 
ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures 
in california  ppgs generally receive a monthly capitation fee for every member assigned to it 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
in these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists

depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims

these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered inpatient hospital care for our hmo members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
hmo or ppg nurses and medical directors are actively involved in discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 
ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology and home health  primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals 
additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  legislative reform and market pressures brought about by a better informed and better organized customer base 
our health plans face substantial competition from for profit and nonprofit hmos  ppos  self funded plans including self insured employers and union trust funds  blue cross blue shield plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  some of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
the development and growth of companies offering internet based connections between health care professionals  employers and members  along with a variety of services  could also create additional competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to user demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors vary by market 
over the past several years  a health plan s 
table of contents ability to interact with employers  members and other third parties including health care professionals via the internet has become a more important competitive factor 
to that end  we have made technology investments to enhance our electronic interactions with third parties 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants in the states in which we operate 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  blue cross of california  unitedhealth group  inc and blue shield of california 
together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
kaiser is the largest hmo in california based on number of enrollees and blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california based on number of enrollees 
there are also a number of small  regional based health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
their respective commercial full risk market share is not as significant as our primary competitors in california and we believe that each remains in california primarily to serve their national  self funded accounts california employees 
our largest competitor in arizona is blue cross blue shield of arizona 
our arizona hmo also competes with unitedhealth group inc  cigna  aetna and humana inc our oregon health plan competes primarily against kaiser  unitedhealth group  providence  regence blue cross blue shield  pacificsource and lifewise 
in the northeast  our connecticut health plan competes for business with aetna  wellpoint  inc anthem bcbs  connecticare  inc  unitedhealth group  inc unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  and cigna 
our main competitors in new york are unitedhealth group  inc unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  wellpoint  inc empire blue cross blue shield  aetna  hip ghi and cigna 
our main competitors in new jersey are unitedhealth group  inc unitedhealthcare oxford health plans  horizon blue cross blue shield  aetna and cigna 
marketing and sales we market our products and services to individuals and employer groups through inside sales staff  independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
for our group health business  we market our products and services utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups  group insurance brokers and consultants 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled by their employer based on the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecasted by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable regulations that in certain circumstances prohibit experience rating of group accounts ie  setting the premium for the group based on its past use of health care services and by state regulations governing the manner in which premiums are structured 
in some of our markets we sell individual policies  which are generally sold through independent brokers and agents 
in some states  carriers are allowed to individually underwrite these policies ie select applicants to whom coverage will be provided and others who are denied  although in other states there may be a requirement of guaranteed issue that restricts the carrier s discretion 
in guaranteed issue states  exclusions for preexisting 
table of contents conditions are generally permitted 
where individual underwriting is permitted  the carrier may rescind the policy coverage if the individual misrepresents his or her medical history in the application process 
see item a 
risk factors proposed federal and state legislation affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us and regulatory activities and litigation relating to the rescission of coverage  if resolved unfavorably  could adversely affect us for additional information on health plans right to rescind coverage 
we believe that the importance of the ultimate health care consumer or member in the health care product purchasing process is likely to increase in the future  particularly in light of advances in technology and online resources 
accordingly  we are focusing our marketing strategies on the development of distinct brand identities and innovative product service offerings that will appeal to potential health plan members 
for example  we introduced decision power sm  which is a series of programs designed to more directly involve patients in their health care decisions 
these programs allow our members to access information and consult with health coaches as they are making decisions regarding health care issues 
in addition  in we added a number of enhancements on the it s your life sm wellsite on the company s website 
the wellsite gives commercial and medicare members easy access to information they need to make smarter choices about their health and about their health care and health care costs 
as more employers begin to offer consumer directed health plans such as health savings accounts hsas and health reimbursement accounts hras  we believe consumers need to be able to learn  plan and make complex decisions regarding their health care 
our new wellsite combines access to current health net and vendor content and tools 
consumer directed health care plans  health savings accounts and health reimbursement accounts health savings accounts were created in as part of the mma 
hsas are individually owned accounts  similar to an ira or a k retirement plan  that generally allow employees or individuals to make contributions to the account on a pretax basis 
funds in hsas can be used to pay for certain qualified medical expenses such as plan deductibles  copayments and coinsurance on a tax free basis 
hsa funds can be invested and earnings on the investments are generally tax free 
hsas must be used in conjunction with high deductible health plans 
high deductible health plans provide in and out of network benefits and cover a wide range of health care services 
our northeast and arizona health plans launched hsa programs in and our california and oregon health plans launched hsa programs in our hsa programs and other consumer driven health care products provide our members with tools to determine what health care services they may need and to estimate how much those services would cost 
we support our consumer directed programs with web based services that assist members in educating themselves about health care 
the web based program includes webmd s subimo estimator tools  decision power sm  prescription drug and hospital comparison tools 
in  we expanded our consumer driven health care initiative by offering a health net health reimbursement account at our health plan in california 
an hra is a health reimbursement arrangement funded solely by an employer where the employer reimburses an employee for health expenses not covered by the group health insurance plan such as deductibles and coinsurance amounts 
employees are reimbursed tax free for qualified medical expenses that the employer agrees to reimburse  up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period 
subject to the employer s discretion  up to of any unused amounts in the hra at the end of a plan year can be carried forward for reimbursement in subsequent years 
see item a 
risk factors the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our products competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
health net systems consolidation project as discussed in previous years  we continue to work on a number of systems and operational initiatives designed to improve our customer service  realize operational cost efficiencies and improve our decision making capability 
in  we completed our migration to a single medical management platform 
this platform 
table of contents provides operational efficiency in clinical operating units  allows for better multi disciplinary communication amongst our clinicians  and delivers our clinicians improved decision making and patient support tools 
in the third quarter of  we also announced the next stage of our operational strategy 
this stage is a three year effort to consolidate claim platforms across the enterprise and to consolidate service centers and associated staff 
the completion of the projects will enable us to improve claim turnaround times  auto adjudication rates  electronic data interchange  and internet capabilities 
we anticipate that the benefits of these initiatives will begin to emerge in the second half of and build through however  there are risks associated with these systems efforts 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in referring cases to the most appropriate providers 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practices in the medical profession 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos and other healthcare organizations 
hmos that comply with review requirements and quality standards receive accreditation 
the commercial line of business of our arizona  california  connecticut  new jersey and new york hmo subsidiaries have all received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent  which is the highest score ncqa awards 
hn california s medicare line of business also received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent 
in addition  hn california s medicaid line of business known as medi cal received ncqa accreditation with a score of commendable  which is customary for first time accreditation 
our mhn subsidiary has received urac accreditation 
government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all current state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our businesses 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation 
on december   the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of mma was signed into law 
this complex legislation made many significant structural changes to the federal medicare program and added a voluntary prescription drug benefit  called a part d benefit  which was made available to medicare beneficiaries starting january  
table of contents the mma changed the methodology for payment to private plans to a competitive bidding process beginning in for the medicare advantage plans  the federal cms calculates county specific payment rates based on fee for service costs in the county and a legislated formula 
these rates then serve as a benchmark against which we must bid for providing the medicare package of services 
the projected savings from the benchmark rate is used to fund additional benefits to members 
the remaining is retained by cms 
cms then pays us a monthly rate for each enrollee  which is the bid amount  with risk adjustment for that member  plus the of savings if any in the bid 
the risk adjustment factor reflects the member s age  gender and health status 
the mma also authorized regional ppos to serve regions covering the us and its territories  and authorized other products designed to provide a private market option on a broader scale 
our medicare contracts are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit hmos and ppos operating under medicare contracts to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 
in january  we were notified by the cms that we were deficient in certain administrative procedures with respect to our stand alone pdp products  and were directed to cease the sale of such products until resumption of sale was approved by cms 
medicaid and related legislation 
federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government  such as the medicaid program known as medi cal in california and schip known as healthy families in california 
they are largely regulated and administered by state agencies and thus there are variations in these programs from state to state 
federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs 
federal law permits the federal government to oversee and  in some cases  to enact  regulations and other requirements that must be followed by the states 
medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms  schip is administered by the health resources and services administration  another arm of the department of health and human services 
privacy regulations 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors relating to the privacy and security of transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations  consisting of privacy regulations  transactions and codeset requirements and security regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
we are in compliance with the hipaa privacy regulations  the requirements relating to transactions and codesets and the security regulations 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 

table of contents erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor dol 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
other federal regulations 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and  in some instances  impose added costs on our business 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 
state laws and regulations our hmos  insurance companies and behavioral health plan are subject to extensive state regulation 
set forth below are the principal hmo regulatory agencies that govern our health plans and insurance companies 
company regulatory agency arizona hmo arizona department of insurance california hmo california department of managed health care connecticut hmo connecticut department of insurance  connecticut department of social services new jersey hmo new jersey department of banking and insurance  new jersey department of human services  division of medical assistance and health services new york hmo new york department of insurance  new york department of health oregon hmo oregon department of business and consumer services health net life insurance company california department of insurance generally  and the department of insurance of each state in which it does business health net insurance of new york  inc new york department of insurance mhn california department of managed health care  new york department of insurance  new jersey department of banking and insurance  connecticut department of insurance while there are state by state variations  hmo regulation generally is very comprehensive 
among the areas regulated by these regulatory agencies are adequacy of financial resources  network of health care providers and administrative operations  sales and enrollment requirements  disclosure documents and notice requirements  product offerings  including the scope of mandatory benefits and required offerings of benefits that are optional coverages  procedures for member grievance resolution and medical necessity determinations  accessibility of providers  handling of provider claims including out of network claims and adherence to timely and accurate payment and appeal rules  and linguistic and cultural accessibility standards  governance requirements and reporting requirements 

table of contents variations in state regulation also arise in connection with the intensity of government oversight 
variations include the need to file or have affirmatively approved certain proposals before use or implementation by the health plan  the degree of review and comment by the regulatory agency  the amount and type of reporting by the health plan to the regulatory agency  the extent and frequency of audit or other examination  and the authority and extent of investigative activity  enforcement action  corrective action authority  and penalties and fines 
insurance and hmo laws impose a number of financial requirements and restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries  which vary from state to state 
they generally include certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements  restrictions on dividends and other distributions to the parent corporations and affiliated corporations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
these financial requirements are subject to change  which may require us to commit additional capital to certain regulated subsidiaries or may limit our ability to move capital through dividends and other distributions 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to legal restrictions on our ability to price some of our products 
some products may be subject to regulatory approval of premium levels 
generally  insurance and hmo laws require premiums to be established at amounts reasonably related to our costs 
pending federal and state legislation there are a number of other legislative initiatives and proposed regulations currently pending or previously proposed at the federal and state levels which could increase regulation of  and costs incurred by  the health care industry 
these measures and other initiatives  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations 
see item a 
risk factors proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulation 
intellectual property we have registered and maintain various service marks  trademarks and trade names that we use in our businesses  including marks and names incorporating the health net phrase  and from time to time we apply for additional registrations of such marks 
we utilize these and other marks and names in connection with the marketing and identification of products and services 
we believe such marks and names are valuable and material to our marketing efforts 
employees as of december   health net  inc and its subsidiaries employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time or temporary basis 
these employees perform a variety of functions  including  among other things  provision of administrative services for employers  providers and members  negotiation of agreements with physician groups  hospitals  pharmacies and other health care providers  handling of claims for payment of hospital and other services  and provision of data processing services 
our employees are not unionized and we have not experienced any work stoppages since our inception 
we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 
dependence upon customers the federal government is the only customer of the company s government contracts segment  with premiums and fees accounting for of our government contracts revenue 
in addition  the federal government is a significant customer of the company s health plan services segment as a result of its contract with cms for coverage of medicare eligible individuals  including part d prescription plans  state agencies for federally subsidized medicaid and schip programs  and coverage of federal employees under the federal employees health benefits program 
medicare revenues accounted for of our total revenue in 
table of contents recent developments and other company information withdrawal from connecticut medicaid program the contract between hnct and the connecticut department of social services dss  under which our connecticut medicaid program has operated  expired on june  from june  to december   hnct and dss amended the contract to extend the term of the contract on a month to month basis 
on november   the managed care responsibilities of four contractors  including hnct  in the state s medicaid program were terminated by the state  effective december   over the issue of the contractors challenge to the state freedom of information commission s determination that medicaid managed care contractors should be subject to the state s freedom of information act ct foia and  as such  are required to disclose their commercial provider reimbursement rates and other proprietary and trade secret information 
in december  dss required  as a condition of contracting with dss for the provision of services under the connecticut medicaid program  that each contractor agree to a material change in the nature and scope of the contractor s obligations and  additionally  agree to a provision acknowledging that the contractor performs a government function subject to public disclosure under ct foia 
after careful review and consideration  hnct determined that agreement to such contractual provisions could have a material adverse effect on hnct s ability to contract with providers and vendors  as well as on hnct s ability to compete effectively in the connecticut medicaid and commercial markets 
based on dss s foia requirements and certain other factors  hnct made the decision to discontinue its participation in the connecticut medicaid program 
as part of a transition arrangement with dss  hnct has agreed to continue to perform administrative services for the connecticut medicaid program until at least february   though dss and hnct may mutually agree to extend the arrangement 
hnct is working with dss to develop and implement an appropriate transition plan so that all hnct medicaid members receive uninterrupted coverage and ongoing access to health care services 
we expect to have completely exited the connecticut medicaid program by the end of the first quarter of operations strategy on november   we announced that we are undertaking a company wide operations strategy intended to enable health net to streamline its operations  including consolidating technology platforms  combining duplicative administrative and operational functions and outsourcing certain operations where appropriate 
we are targeting annual g a expense savings of approximately million by and expect to incur pretax restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of between million and million over the course of purchase of the guardian s interest in healthcare solutions in  we entered into a marketing and risk sharing arrangements with the guardian covering primarily small group membership in the states of connecticut  new york and new jersey 
under these arrangements  our managed care and indemnity products were marketed to existing insureds of the guardian 
in addition  these products were distributed through the brokerage community in an integrated marketing effort under the trade name healthcare solutions  or hcs 
as part of these arrangements  the guardian generally had the exclusive right to market and sell our hmo  ppo and pos products to small employer groups  and we and the guardian each retained of the premiums and claims 
in addition  we recovered from the guardian a specified portion of the administrative expenses and the direct marketing costs  which were shared equally 
in  various new products were launched for the hcs product portfolio  including health savings accounts and our preferred line of products  called outlook

our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to our members 
the total health care costs we incur are affected by the number and type of individual services provided and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to 
table of contents accurately predict health care costs and to control future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors affecting health care costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  a large scale public health epidemic could affect our ability to control health care costs 
see large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for several years  one of the fastest increasing categories of our health care costs has been the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare and the constant pressure that places on rates from commercial health plans  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition caused by market concentration 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs and changes in discounts 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
the inability to forecast and manage our health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
our premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge or bid  factors such as competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  seasonality  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and insured population characteristics 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
in  our pricing was  we believe  generally consistent with that of our competitors but there can be no assurance that we will not institute higher premiums in the future 
in addition  we continue to see increases in our small group and individual business while our large group enrollment declines as we seek to improve margins by changing the mix of our commercial business to smaller accounts 
any future increase in premiums could result in the loss of members 
additionally  there is always the possibility that adverse risk selection could occur when 
table of contents members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
in the various states in which we do business  premium prices are also constrained by state laws and regulations which restrict the spread between premiums and benefits  such as laws and regulations that require a minimum loss ratio of a certain percentage 
these laws and regulations not only restrict our ability to raise our premiums but also create competitive pressure from some of our competitors who may have lower health care costs than we have and therefore price their premiums at relatively low levels in relation to our cost of care 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of incurred costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported and for claims received but not processed 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  it could have a negative impact on our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
if our actual liability is lower than estimated  it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
if we were to lose membership as a result of our premium prices being set too high  there can be no assurance that we would be able to regain that membership by reducing premiums 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation  which increases our cost of doing business and could adversely affect our ability to grow our businesses 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change  and may be interpreted in ways that differ from our understanding retroactively based upon the decisions of regulators or courts 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these regulations to interpret them and to impose substantial fines when they believe violations have occurred 
regulatory agencies have imposed substantial fines against us in the past  and may impose substantial fines against us in the future if they determine that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations 
see item legal proceedings miscellaneous proceedings for additional information 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  and or increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
further  individual associates may violate these laws and rules  notwithstanding our internal policies and compliance programs 
in particular  our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  approval of policy language and benefits  appeals and grievances with respect to benefit determinations  provider contracting  utilization management  issuance and termination of policies and a wide variety of other regulations relating to the development and operation of health plans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statutory capital requirements for additional information 

table of contents as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined  debarred and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
we are also exposed to other risks associated with us government contracting  including dependence upon congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in addition  laws or regulations adopted in the future could adversely affect our business 
see proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed care industry could adversely affect us 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
our efforts to capitalize on medicare business opportunities could prove to be unsuccessful 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our total revenue in and an expected in over the last several years we have significantly expanded our medicare health plans and restructured our medicare program management team and operations to enhance our ability to pursue business opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
for example  in we introduced private fee for service pffs medicare advantage plans  expanded our medicare part d prescription drug benefits plans to all states  and are in the process of enhancing our hmo ppo product offerings 
this growth requires substantial administrative and operational capabilities  which we have developed or for which we have contracted 
for example  we use third party vendors to administer the enrollment  claims and billing functions for stand alone pdp and pffs 
if the execution of these key operational functions is not successful  or we are unable to develop administrative capabilities to address the additional needs of our growing medicare programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business 
in january  we were directed by the cms to temporarily cease the sale of our stand alone pdp products due to certain administrative deficiencies relating to our ability to timely process stand alone pdp enrollment applications 
we do not believe that this temporary suspension will have a material adverse effect on our medicare business 
particular risks associated with our providing medicare part d prescription drug benefits under the mma include potential uncollectibility of receivables  inadequacy of pricing assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs  as well as the underlying seasonality of this business  and extended settlement periods for claims submissions 
in addition  in connection with our participation in the medicare advantage and part d programs  we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms 
this mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its medicare enrollees 
while we have historically recorded revenue and received payment for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements  there can be no assurance that we will receive payment from cms for the levels of the risk adjustment premium revenue recorded in any given quarter 
if the cost and complexity of the recent medicare changes exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives 

table of contents a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our annual revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid and tricare 
all of the revenues in our government contracts segment come from the federal government 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
contracts under these programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
currently  many states are experiencing budget deficits  and some states have reduced or have begun to reduce  or have proposed reductions in  payments to medicaid managed care providers 
any significant reduction in payments received in connection with medicaid could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  states can impose requirements on medicaid programs that make continued operations not feasible 
in connecticut  we are in the process of transitioning out of the medicaid program due to the state requiring medicaid contractors to publicly disclose certain proprietary and trade secret information and persistent underfunding of the program 
we expect to be out of the program completely by the end of the first quarter of for additional information on our withdrawal from the connecticut medicaid program  see item business recent developments and other company information withdrawal from connecticut medicaid program 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
health care operations under our tricare north contract are scheduled to conclude on march  in the second quarter of  we received a draft request for proposal from the department of defense for the next generation of tricare contracts 
we submitted our comments on the draft to the department of defense and are awaiting the release of the formal request for proposal 
we anticipate that the government will issue a formal request for proposal in the first half of and that proposals will be due approximately six months after the formal request for proposal is issued 
however  the department of defense has the authority to negotiate with health net for an extension of our tricare contract for the north region for up to two additional one year option periods 
if the department of defense elects to extend for two additional one year option periods and both option periods are exercised  the tricare contract for the north region would conclude on march  if the contract is not extended  and we are not awarded a new tricare contract  or if the terms and conditions of a new contract were significantly changed  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we may experience losses as a result of the regional concentration of our business 
our business operations are concentrated in the northeast in the states of connecticut  new york and new jersey and in the states of california  arizona and oregon 
our california operations represented approximately of our total revenue in due to this concentration in a small number of states  and  in particular  
table of contents california  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results arising from a significant economic downturn in one or more of these states 
if economic conditions in these states significantly deteriorate  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if any one of our health plans experiences significant losses  our consolidated results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
losses of accounts or deterioration in margins in any one of the states in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
proposed federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
the united states congress and federal and state regulatory agencies frequently consider legislative proposals and regulatory initiatives which  if enacted  could materially affect the managed health care industry and the regulatory environment 
these proposals have included initiatives which  if enacted  could have material adverse effects on our operations  including subjecting us to additional litigation risk  regulatory compliance costs and restrictions on our business operations 
such measures have proposed  among other things  to restrict or eliminate health insurers and health plans in the marketplace  restrict a health insurer or health plan s profitability or regulate the medical cost ratio  require health plans to pay significantly higher taxes  or reduce government funding of government sponsored health programs in which we participate  mandate certain benefits and administrative or other services that could increase the cost of healthcare or administrative services  or restrict our right to manage the member s care through authorization requirements  requirements of medical necessity  or formularies for covered pharmaceuticals  restrict our ability to contract with and manage access to providers and provider groups  enhance certain provider payments or appeal rights  or restrict our ability to select and terminate providers  mandate certain grievance and appeal rights for our members or providers  including establishment of third party reviews of certain care decisions  and regulate the individual coverage market by restricting or mandating premium levels  restrict our underwriting discretion  or restrict our ability to rescind coverage based on a member s misrepresentations and omissions 
recently  the issue of affordable health insurance and the challenge of insuring the uninsured have generated much public attention 
in states where we conduct business  governors and state legislatures are considering various proposals to cover the uninsured 
these proposals include  but are not limited to  restructuring the health insurance market to mandate coverage  guaranteeing insurance in the individual market  merging individual and small group markets  placing a cap on loss ratios or premiums or otherwise taking steps to expand access to health insurance in a manner that does not allow for management of risk 
we cannot predict the outcome of the legislative and regulatory proposals described above or any other such legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulations 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
we also cannot predict the outcome of the federal and state elections and the impact  if any  that the election outcomes will ultimately have on our operations 

table of contents regulatory activities and litigation relating to the rescission of coverage  if resolved unfavorably  could adversely affect us 
in our individual business in certain states  persons applying for insurance policies are required to provide information about their medical history as well as that of family members for whom they are seeking coverage 
these applications are subjected to a formal underwriting process to determine whether the applicants present an acceptable risk 
if coverage is issued and the health plan or insurer subsequently discovers that the applicant materially misrepresented their or their family members medical history  the health plan or insurer has the legal right to rescind the policy in accordance with applicable legal standards 
although rescission has long been a legally authorized practice  the decisions of health plans to rescind coverage and decline payment to treating providers  as well as the procedures used to do so  have recently generated public attention  particularly in california 
as a result  there has been both legislative and regulatory action in connection with this issue 
as of january   health plans and insurers in california  under certain defined circumstances  are obligated to pay providers for services they have rendered despite the rescission of a member s policy 
on october   the california department of managed health care dmhc and the california department of insurance doi announced that they would be issuing joint regulations that would restrict the ability of health plans and insurers to rescind a member s coverage and deny payment to treating providers 
the dmhc has issued draft proposed regulations and it is expected that the doi will do so as well in the near future 
on october   the dmhc initiated a survey of health net of california s activities regarding the rescission of policies for the period through this survey is similar to ones the dmhc has already conducted of other health plans in california  which have resulted in administrative penalties 
the results of the survey are expected to be made public some time in during the course of the survey  which is still ongoing  the dmhc alleged that health net of california had failed to timely provide information to the dmhc s survey team 
as a result of this allegation  health net of california and the dmhc agreed that health net of california would pay an administrative penalty of million  which it has paid 
the penalty does not affect the ongoing survey or the corresponding enforcement investigation of the dmhc  the results of either or both of which could result in further penalties and corrective actions 
the doi recently announced that it was imposing administrative penalties on another insurer relating to its rescission practices  and in the future we also may be subject to a survey by the doi relating to our rescission practices 
we are also party to arbitrations and litigation  including a putative class action  in which rescinded members allege that we unlawfully rescinded their coverage 
the lawsuits generally seek reimbursement for the cost of medical services that were not paid as a result of the rescission  and also seek to recover for emotional distress  attorneys fees and punitive damages 
one of these arbitrations was decided on february   and resulted in an award to the claimant of approximately million  including estimated attorneys fees  which amount has yet to be determined 
recent court of appeal decisions in california adverse to health plans and insurers have increased the risks associated with rescissions of policies based on applications containing material misrepresentations of medical history  and may make it more difficult to rescind policies in the future 
additionally  the los angeles city attorney recently filed a complaint against us relating to our underwriting practices and rescission of certain individual policies 
the complaint seeks equitable relief and civil penalties for  among other things  alleged false advertising  violations of unfair competition laws and violations of the california penal code 
these developments  together with increased media scrutiny of health plans and insurers rescission practices  may also increase the risk of additional litigation in this area 
we cannot predict the outcome of the anticipated regulatory proposals described above  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of those or other regulatory or legislative activities relating to rescissions 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
similarly  given the complexity and scope of rescission lawsuits  their final outcome cannot be predicted with any certainty 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate 
table of contents unfavorable resolution of these cases depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of these cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others pertaining to financial performance  market conduct and regulatory compliance issues 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  we are currently the subject of a regulatory investigation in new jersey that relates to the timeliness and accuracy of our claim payments for services rendered by out of network providers 
this investigation includes an audit of our claims payment practices for services rendered by out of network providers for through in new jersey 
the new jersey department of banking and insurance dobi has informed us that  based on the results of the audit  we will be required to remediate certain claims payments for this period and will be assessed a regulatory fine 
we have reached an agreement with dobi regarding the claims that will require remediation and have had preliminary discussions with dobi regarding the amount of the fine 
we expect to finalize an agreement with dobi on the amount of the fine  which could be substantial  and enter into a consent order in the near future 
a portion of the million charge that we recorded in the third quarter of relates to the remediation of the new jersey claims and the fine to be assessed by dobi 
in addition  on february   the new york attorney general nyag announced that his office is conducting an industry wide investigation into the manner in which health insurers calculate usual  customary and reasonable charges for purposes of reimbursing members for out of network medical services 
the nyag s office has issued subpoenas to health insurance companies  including us  in connection with this investigation 
as described by the nyag in a press conference on february   the threatened claims appear to be similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in the mccoy  wachtel and scharfman cases described above 
we intend to respond to the subpoena and cooperate with the nyag as appropriate in his investigation 
our new jersey  connecticut and new york health plans have also been subject to other investigations by dobi and the new york department of insurance on a variety of other matters and in some cases have entered into consent agreements relating to  and have agreed to pay fines in connection with  these practices 
similarly  health net of california  our california hmo  has entered into a consent agreement with the california dmhc regarding its prepayment line item review and repricing processes  and both the california and oregon plans are currently undergoing reviews relating to rescission practices 
in addition  from time to time  agencies of the us government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors 
government investigations of us  whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines or penalties being imposed upon us  or could lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracting  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions  including litigation  which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
some of these providers may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with specialists and other secondary providers  and may contract with primary care physicians  to provide services 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  the liability of our hmo subsidiaries for unpaid provider claims has not been definitively settled 
there can be no assurance that we will not be liable for unpaid provider claims 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds that have coverage for out of network services are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider  rather  the plan s obligation is to reimburse the member based upon the terms of the member s plan 
in some states and product lines  the amount of reimbursement is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is established by a standard set forth in the plan that is not clearly translated into dollar terms  such as usual  customary and reasonable 
in such instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
regulatory authorities in various states may also challenge the manner in which we reimburse members for services performed by non contracted providers 
for example  as described in more detail in item legal proceedings miscellaneous proceedings  the nyag recently announced that his office is in the process of conducting such an investigation 
as a result of litigation or regulatory activity  we may have to pay providers additional amounts or reimburse members for their out of pocket payments 
the uncertainty about our financial obligations for such services and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of our original payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  provider groups and hospitals that do contract with us have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for additional information regarding provider disputes  see item legal proceedings 

table of contents we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions to which any corporation may be subject  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  and intellectual property and real estate related disputes 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage and insufficient payments for out of network services  claims by employer groups for return of premiums  and claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business  and claims related to reinsurance matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
for example in the mccoy  wachtel  and scharfman cases described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the plaintiffs allege that the manner in which our various subsidiaries paid member claims for out of network services was improper 
plaintiffs also sought severe sanctions against us for a variety of alleged misconduct  discovery abuses and fraud on the court in connection with the litigation proceedings 
based on our assessment of developments in this litigation  during the three months ended december   we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in anticipation of our ongoing litigation defense expenses in these cases  as well as the probable award of attorneys fees 
in august  we reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs in mccoy  wachtel and scharfman to settle those cases 
a definitive settlement agreement has not yet been finalized and is subject to court approval 
during the three months ended september   we recorded a million pretax charge primarily related to the settlement in principle of mccoy  wachtel and scharfman and related matters 
until a definitive settlement agreement is executed and approved by the court  these matters will remain outstanding 
if we are unable to reach an agreement that is acceptable to all parties and the court  these proceedings will continue and an unfavorable resolution of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and or financial condition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the matters and the charges associated with these matters 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring material expenses in the defense of litigation matters  including without limitation  substantial discovery costs 
while we currently have insurance policies that may provide coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation matters  there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for any particular case or liability 
insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance could not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  certain liabilities such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
plaintiffs attorneys have increasingly used 
table of contents expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic 
responding to these requests  the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents  may require application of significant resources and impose significant costs on us 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described in note to our consolidated financial statements  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in an earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
although we have recorded litigation reserves which represent our best estimate on probable losses  both known and incurred but not reported  our recorded reserves might prove to be inadequate to cover an adverse result or settlement for extraordinary matters  such as the matters described in note therefore  costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our forecasts and other forward looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties 
our performance may not be consistent with these forecasts and forward looking statements 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our future results  including estimated revenues  net earnings and other operating and financial metrics 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
for example  during  gross margins in our commercial and medicare lines of business were somewhat less than expected  while pretax margins in our government contracts segment were higher than projected 
administrative expenses were lower than original expectations 
such variations from expectations could cause negative impacts on our financial and operating results 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report on form k  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure that our performance will meet any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize the entire mix of publicly available historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us  our services  and our industry when evaluating our forecasts and other forward looking statements relating to our operations and financial performance 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our products competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  superior provider and supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future  including emerging competitors in the medicare program 
we believe that increased funding provided by the mma will increase the number of competitors in senior health services and could affect our medicare advantage program 
for example  in  a large ppg in kern county  california was able to secure a knox keene license and a contract with cms and is now in direct competition with our medicare operations in that county 
in addition  financial services or other technology based companies could enter the market and compete with us on the basis of their streamlined administrative functions 
the addition of new competitors can occur 
table of contents relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
there is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies are frequently up for re bid and the loss of any significant government contract to a competitor could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
nearly every major managed care organization has launched  announced or is developing hsa compatible high deductible health plans 
we have launched hsa programs in our northeast  arizona  california and oregon health plans 
our hsa programs represented a very small percentage of our total revenue in some of our large competitors  such as aetna and blue cross blue shield plans  have made large investments in  and heavily marketed  their consumer directed health plans and have gained more enrollment in many markets across the country 
if their enrollment trend continues  it may widen the competitive gap between us over the next several years 
if we fail to design  maintain and effectively market consumer directed health care programs that are attractive to consumers and  as a result  are unable to achieve a competitive market share in the consumer directed care category  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically experienced significant turnover in senior management and are in the process of reorganizing our management structure 
if we are unable to manage the succession of our key executives  it could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced a high turnover in our senior management team in recent years and are in the process of reorganizing our management structure 
although we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with our key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us 
we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million in borrowings under our financing facility which will amortize over a period ending december for a description of our senior notes and our financing facility  see liquidity and capital resources capital structure 
in addition  to provide liquidity  we have a million five year revolving credit facility that expires in june as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
our existing indebtedness  and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

table of contents we continually evaluate options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
recently  credit markets have experienced unusual uncertainty  and liquidity and access to capital markets have tightened 
consequently  in the event we need to access the credit markets to refinance our debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
we are a holding company and a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
in addition  in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements  known as rbc 
these laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the national association of insurance commissioners 
failure to maintain the minimum rbc standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action  including increased reporting and or state supervision 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
our regulated subsidiaries are currently in compliance with the risk based capital or other similar requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and health net  inc s free cash flow

see liquidity and capital resources capital structure amortizing financing facility for additional information regarding our financing facility 
our revolving credit facility and our financing facility require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
in addition  our revolving credit facility and our financing facility require us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and our financing facility could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility  our financing facility  and  in some circumstances  under the indenture governing our senior notes  which  in any case  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems 
health net s operations strategy team is currently reviewing options for transitioning to a single technology platform companywide to gain operational and cost efficiencies 
we believe that by consolidating our current systems  we will gain operational and cost efficiencies 
transitioning to a single in house system and utilizing varying levels of system outsourcing are options currently under consideration by management 
see item business additional information concerning our business health net systems consolidation project for additional information regarding this consolidation project 
any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
in addition  we may  from time to time  obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties  which may make our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we contract with independent third party vendors who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
these third party vendors include  but are not limited to  information technology system providers  medical management providers  claims administration providers  billing and enrollment providers  call center providers and specialty service providers 
our arrangements with third party vendors may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data  as a result of our failure to adequately monitor and regulate their performance  changes in the vendors operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control 
violations of laws or regulations governing our business by third party vendors could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business 
in addition  to the extent we outsource selected services or selected functions to third parties in foreign jurisdictions  we could be exposed to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states  including international economic and political conditions  additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and fluctuations in currency values 
on november   we announced that we are undertaking a reorganization of our management structure  which is expected to include additional outsourcing of claims administration and certain other operations to third party vendors 
additional outsourcing projects such as those included as part of the reorganization could increase our exposure to the risks outlined above 
in addition  we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors  as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing or otherwise 
this could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our results of operations 

table of contents we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa 
in december  the department of health and human services promulgated regulations under hipaa related to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted phi 
the regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to safeguard phi  and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
in addition  the regulations could expose us to additional liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates  including the third party vendors involved in our outsourcing projects 
although we provide for appropriate protections in our contracts with our business associates  we have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with hipaa and other state and federal privacy regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
for example  the company and the managed health care industry have been subject to negative publicity surrounding practices in connection with the rescission of individual health insurance policies 
in addition  political campaigns frequently mention health care and related health care reform proposals 
such political discourse can often generate publicity that portrays managed care in a negative light 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or litigation that could adversely affect us 
if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and administrative expense increases are difficult to predict 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions  growth  membership declines or changes in business  difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  acquisitions  reliance on outsourced services  regulatory requirements  including compliance with hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
for example  in we spent approximately million in general and administrative expenses on medicare related opportunities 
in  our general and administrative expenses increased as a result of our focus on investing in commercial enrollment growth in targeted small group segments and for our ongoing investment in medicare as we prepared for entry into the private fee for service market 
in  our administrative expenses increased as we continued to support expected commercial growth 
on november   we announced that we are undertaking a reorganization plan to enhance efficiency and achieve general and administrative cost savings 
the reorganization is intended to enable us to streamline our operations  including consolidating technology platforms  combining duplicative administrative and operational functions and outsourcing certain operations where appropriate 
we are targeting annual savings of million in general and administrative expenses by in connection with the reorganization 
however  there can be no assurance that the reorganization will produce the anticipated savings or that the reorganization will not significantly disrupt operations thereby negatively impacting our financial performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our administrative expenses  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents if we are required to publicly disclose information regarding our reimbursement rates and preferred drug lists for our programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  a petition was submitted to the connecticut freedom of information commission the ct foic seeking  among other things  information regarding provider reimbursement rates and maintenance of preferred drug lists used by managed care organizations contracting with the connecticut department of social services in connection with the connecticut medicaid program 
in response to the petition  the ct foic ruled that the connecticut department of social services dss must furnish the information requested and had to amend its existing contracts with managed care organizations participating in the connecticut medicaid program making them subject to the connecticut freedom of information act 
health net of connecticut and two other managed care organizations appealed the ct foic decision to the connecticut superior court  which upheld the ct foic s decision 
on february   we learned that the attorneys representing the appellees in this appeal notified the managed care companies that responded to dss s request for proposals with respect to connecticut s combined husky a  schip and charter oak insurance plan that they would all be subject to the broadest interpretation of the connecticut freedom of information act  and therefore  pursuant to a freedom of information act request  would be required to disclose information concerning their commercial businesses  even in states other than connecticut 
consumer activists in connecticut therefore appear to be supporting the extension of the state s freedom of information act into non medicaid programs  such as those for the uninsured 
the situation in connecticut  where an expansive reading of the state s freedom of information act is being adopted in state agencies  the attorney general s office  the legislature and the courts  poses the risk that similar expansive readings of state freedom of information statutes could spread to other states  particularly new york and new jersey 
if we are required to publicly disclose information regarding our reimbursement rates  preferred drug lists or other trade secret information as a result of the expansion of the scope of state freedom of information statutes  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to contract with providers and compete effectively in the marketplace 
changes in the value of our investment assets could have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
substantially all of our investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
these securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments  such as our debt securities  and a worsening of credit market disruptions or sustained market downturns could have additional negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative affect on our stockholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of 
table of contents independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
there have been a number of investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers over the last several years regarding allegedly inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
for example  cms has increased its scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurers regarding allegedly improper sales and marketing practices in connection with the sale of medicare products 
while we are not aware of any unlawful practices by the company or any of our agents or brokers in connection with the marketing and sales of our products and services  current investigations by the new york attorney general  new york department of insurance  cms and other regulators  as well as regulatory changes initiated in several states in response to allegedly inappropriate broker conduct and broker payment practices  could result in changes in industry practices that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to volatility 
in  the morgan stanley healthcare payor index the hmo index  an index comprised of managed care organizations  including health net  recorded an approximate rise in its value  while the per share value of our common stock decreased by less than 
there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will vary in a manner consistent with the variation in the hmo index or the standard poor s mid cap index of which our common stock is also a component 
the market prices of our common stock and the securities of certain other publicly traded companies in our industry have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  litigation or threatened litigation  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings  receivable collections or membership reports of particular industry participants  and market speculation about or actual acquisition activity 
additionally  adverse developments affecting any one of the leading companies in our sector could cause the price of our common stock to weaken  even if those adverse developments do not otherwise affect us 
there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease and or future terrorist activities  including bio terrorism  could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  a large scale public health epidemic or future acts of bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services  disruption of information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to increased in patient and out patient hospital costs and the cost of any anti viral medication used to treat affected people 
natural disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
natural disasters such as fire  flood  earthquake  tornado  power loss  virus  telecommunications failure  break in or similar event could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan which is intended to provide us with the ability to maintain fully redundant systems for our operations in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 

table of contents however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
current unfavorable economic conditions could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
recent events  including fallout from problems in the us subprime mortgage market  rising oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  indicate a potential near term recession in the us economy 
an economic downturn may impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs and the profitability of our operations

health net  inc et al  wachtel v 
health net  inc  et al and scharfman  et al v 
health net  inc  et al 
these three lawsuits are styled as nationwide class actions 
mccoy and wachtel are pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of a class of subscribers in a number of our large and small employer group plans 
the wachtel complaint initially was filed as a single plaintiff case in new jersey state court on july  subsequently  we removed the wachtel complaint to federal court  and plaintiffs amended their complaint to assert claims on behalf of a class of subscribers in small employer group plans in new jersey on december  the mccoy complaint was filed on april  and asserts claims on behalf of a nationwide class of health net subscribers 
these two cases have been consolidated for purposes of trial 
plaintiffs allege that health net  inc  health net of the northeast  inc and health net of new jersey  inc 
violated the employee retirement income security act of erisa in connection with various practices related to the reimbursement of claims for services provided by out of network onet providers 
plaintiffs seek relief in the form of payment of additional benefits  injunctive and other equitable relief  and attorneys fees 
in september  the district court in mccoy wachtel certified two nationwide classes of health net subscribers who received medical services or supplies from an out of network provider and to whom the defendants paid less than the providers billed charges from through august  class notices were mailed and published in various newspapers at the beginning of july on january   counsel for the plaintiffs in the mccoy wachtel actions filed a separate class action against health net  inc  health net of the northeast  inc  health net of new york  inc 
and health net life insurance co 
captioned scharfman  et al 
v 
health net  inc  et al  cv fsh ps united states district court for the district of new jersey 
on march   the scharfman complaint was amended to add mccoy and wachtel as named plaintiffs and to add a non erisa claim 
the scharfman complaint now alleges both erisa and racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico claims based on conduct similar to that alleged in mccoy wachtel 
the alleged claims in scharfman run from september  until the present 
plaintiffs in the scharfman action seek relief in the form of payment of additional benefits  civil penalties  restitution  compensatory  and consequential damages  treble damages  prejudgment interest and costs  attorney s fees and injunctive and other equitable relief 
on april   we filed a motion to dismiss all counts of that complaint  which is pending 
on july   the magistrate issued her recommendations to the court on this motion  recommending denying the motion to dismiss with respect to the erisa claims  granting the motion to dismiss with respect to the state rico claims  and dismissing the federal rico claims with leave to file an amended complaint and a direction to file a rico case statement 
in the mccoy wachtel actions  on august   plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court seeking sanctions against us for a variety of alleged misconduct  discovery abuses and fraud on the district court 
the district court held twelve days of hearings on plaintiffs sanctions motion between october and march during the course of the hearings  and in their post hearings submissions  plaintiffs also alleged that some of health net s witnesses engaged in perjury and obstruction of justice 
health net denied all such allegations 
while the sanctions proceedings were progressing  the district court and the magistrate judge overseeing discovery entered a number of orders relating  inter alia  to production of documents 
in an order dated may  may order  the district court ordered the restoration  search and review of backed up emails of current and former health net associates 
the restoration process was complex  time consuming and expensive as it involved dealing with over billion pages of documents 
health net was unable to complete the project by the deadline and the district court denied additional time to complete the project 
the project was completed two months after the deadline 

table of contents the may order also set forth certain findings regarding plaintiffs argument that the crime fraud exception to the attorney client privilege should be applied to certain documents for which health net claimed a privilege 
in this ruling  the district court made preliminary findings that a showing of a possible crime or fraud was made 
the review of privileged documents under the crime fraud exception was assigned by the district court to the magistrate judge  who was to review the documents and make a recommendation to the district court 
on january   the magistrate judge made a recommendation that the assertion of privilege for a number of the documents was vitiated by the crime fraud exception 
health net has appealed this ruling to the district court 
in june  the district court asked the magistrate judge to determine if plaintiffs had established a prima facie case that health net had committed a crime or fraud that would vitiate the attorney client privilege claimed for an additional set of health net documents 
the magistrate judge so found and referred the matter to a special master for further review 
no determination has yet been made by the special master 
on december   the district court issued an opinion and order finding that health net s conduct in connection with the discovery process was sanctionable december order 
the district court ordered a number of sanctions against health net  including  but not limited to striking a number of health net s trial exhibits and witnesses  deeming a number of facts to be established against health net  requiring health net to pay for a discovery monitor to oversee the completion of discovery in these cases  ordering that a monetary sanction be imposed upon health net once the district court reviews health net s financial records  ordering health net to pay plaintiffs counsel s fees and expenses associated with the sanctions motion and motions to enforce the district court s discovery orders and re deposing health net witnesses 
in connection therewith  on june   the district court ordered health net to pay plaintiffs counsel fees of  which were paid on july   this amount was accrued for as of june  the district court has not yet announced what  if any  additional penalties will be imposed 
in its december  order  the district court also ordered that health net produce a large number of privileged documents that were first discovered and revealed by health net as a result of the email backup tape restoration effort discussed above 
we appealed that order to the third circuit where it is still pending 
finally  pursuant to the december order  the district court appointed a special master to determine if we have complied with all discovery orders 
in her report  the special master found  among other things  that there was no evidence of intentional or deliberate destruction of emails  there is no evidence of destruction of emails by any individual  and there was no evidence of intentional  malicious or bad faith conduct 
as a result of these findings  plaintiffs requested that the district court accept the special master s report  but reject the portion containing the above quotes 
we have opposed the request that portions of the report be expunged 
the court has yet to rule on plaintiffs request 
due to the developments in the mccoy wachtel cases during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million representing our best estimate of future legal defense costs 
no amount was recorded for the probable loss of the claim  because at that time the probable loss of the claim could not be reasonably estimated 
in august  we engaged in mediation with the plaintiffs that resulted in an agreement in principle to settle mccoy  wachtel and scharfman 
a definitive settlement agreement has not yet been finalized 
once it is finalized  the agreement will be subject to approval by the district court 
the material terms of our agreement in principle with the plaintiffs are as follows health net will establish a million cash settlement fund which will be utilized to pay class members  plaintiffs attorneys fees and expenses and regulatory remediation of claims up to million paid by health net to members in new jersey relating to health net s failure to comply with specific new jersey state laws relating to onet and certain other claims payment practices  health net will establish a million prove up fund to compensate eligible class members who can prove that they paid out of pocket for certain onet claims or who have received balance bills for such services after may   and health net will implement various business practice changes relating to its handling of onet claims  including changes designed to enhance information provided to its members on onet 
table of contents reimbursements 
in addition  the parties have agreed to jointly request that the district court forego the imposition of any further sanctions  penalties or fines against health net or its representatives 
these amounts have been accrued for in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  due to the length of time it has taken to negotiate a series of complex settlement terms with plaintiffs  we agreed with plaintiffs to deposit million into an escrow fund to be used as the cash settlement fund referenced above when a settlement is finally agreed to and approved by the district court 
on january   the million was placed into an escrow account where it will accrue interest until the settlement is finalized 
if the settlement is finalized and approved by the district court  the interest earned on the escrow funds will be used for the benefit of class members 
if the settlement is not finalized or approved  the escrow funds together with the interest will be returned to us 
once a definitive settlement agreement is entered into and approved by the district court  distributions will be made to class members  health net will be released from further liability and the cases will be dismissed 
the settlement of these proceedings is not final and continues to be subject to change until a definitive settlement agreement is entered into and approved by the district court 
if the court does not approve the terms of the definitive agreement  the parties would attempt to renegotiate the portion s of the agreement that were not acceptable to the court 
if we were unable to reach an agreement that is acceptable to all parties and the court  these proceedings would continue 
if the proceedings were to continue  we would continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this litigation 
given the complexity and scope of this litigation it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and or financial condition  depending  in part  upon our results of operations or cash flow at that time 
in addition  the amount involved could be greater than the settlement amount agreed to by the parties in the agreement in principle described above 
in re managed care litigation various class action lawsuits brought on behalf of health care providers against managed care companies  including us  were transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml to the united states district court for the southern district of florida for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in in re managed care litigation  mdl as set forth below  all such provider track actions that were filed against us have been dismissed  including four cases that were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 
the first provider track case was filed against us on may  these provider track actions generally alleged that the defendants  including us  systematically underpaid physicians and other health care providers for medical services to members  have delayed payments to providers  imposed unfair contracting terms on providers  and negotiated capitation payments inadequate to cover the costs of the health care services provided and assert claims under the rico  erisa  and several state common law doctrines and statutes 
the lead physician provider track action asserted claims on behalf of physicians and sought certification of a nationwide class 
on may   we and the representatives of approximately  physicians and state and other medical societies announced that we had signed an agreement settling the lead physician provider track action 
the settlement agreement requires us to pay million to general settlement funds and million for plaintiffs legal fees and to commit to several business practice changes 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement agreement  legal expenses and other expenses related to the mdl litigation 
on september   the district court issued an order granting its final approval of the settlement agreement and directing the entry of final judgment 
four physicians appealed the order approving the settlement  but each of the physicians moved to dismiss their appeals  and all of the appeals were dismissed by the eleventh circuit by june  on july   we made payments  including accrued interest  totaling approximately million pursuant to the settlement agreement 
on july   joint motions to dismiss were filed in the district court with respect to all of the remaining tag along actions in mdl filed on behalf 
table of contents of physicians  and the district court subsequently granted these joint motions to dismiss 
as a result of the physician settlement agreement  the dismissals of the various appeals  and the dismissals of the tag along actions involving physician providers  all cases and proceedings relating to the physician provider track actions against us have been resolved 
four other cases in mdl were brought on behalf of non physician health care providers against us and other managed care companies and sought certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated non physician health care providers 
on october   the court issued an order dismissing pending motions without prejudice and requiring parties in the tag along actions to file status reports indicating whether there is still a case or controversy in each respective case  and notifying the parties that failure to file such a report as to an action will result in the matter being dismissed with prejudice 
in response to this order  on november   three of the non physician cases against us were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 
on january   the fourth non physician case against us was also voluntarily dismissed without prejudice  leaving no cases pending against us in mdl litigation related to the sale of businesses amcareco litigation we are a defendant in two related litigation matters pending in louisiana and texas state courts  both of which relate to claims asserted by three separate state receivers overseeing the liquidation of three health plans in louisiana  texas and oklahoma that were previously owned by our former subsidiary  foundation health corporation fhc  which merged into health net  inc in january in  fhc sold its interest in these plans to amcareco  inc amcareco 
we retained a minority interest in the three plans after the sale 
thereafter  the three plans became known as amcare of louisiana amcare la  amcare of oklahoma amcare ok and amcare of texas amcare tx 
in  three years after the sale of the plans to amcareco  each of the amcare plans was placed under state oversight and ultimately into receivership 
the receivers for each of the amcare plans later filed suit against certain of amcareco s officers  directors and investors  amcareco s independent auditors and its outside counsel in connection with the failure of the three plans 
the three receivers also filed suit against us contending that  among other things  we were responsible as a controlling shareholder of amcareco following the sale of the plans for post acquisition misconduct by amcareco and others that caused the three health plans to fail and ultimately be placed into receivership 
the action brought against us by the receiver for amcare la action originally was filed in louisiana on june  that original action sought only to enforce a parental guarantee that fhc had issued in the amcare la receiver alleged that the parental guarantee obligated fhc to contribute sufficient capital to the louisiana health plan to enable the plan to maintain statutory minimum capital requirements 
the original action also alleged that the parental guarantee was not terminated by virtue of the sale of the louisiana plan 
the actions brought against us by amcare tx and amcare ok originally were filed in texas state court on june  and included allegations that after the sale to amcareco we were nevertheless responsible for the mismanagement of the three plans by amcareco and that the three plans were insolvent at the time of the sale to amcareco 
on september  and october   respectively  the amcare tx receiver and the amcare ok receiver intervened in the pending amcare la litigation in louisiana 
thereafter  all three receivers amended their complaints to assert essentially the same claims against us and successfully moved to consolidate their three actions in the louisiana state court proceeding 
the texas state court ultimately stayed the texas action and ordered that the parties submit quarterly reports to the texas court regarding the status of the consolidated louisiana litigation 
on june   a consolidated trial of the claims asserted against us by the three receivers commenced in state court in baton rouge  louisiana 
the claims of the receiver for amcare tx were tried before a jury and the claims of the receivers for the amcare la and amcare ok were tried before the judge in the same proceeding 
on june   the jury considering the claims of the receiver for amcare tx returned a verdict 
table of contents against us in the amount of million  consisting of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the court later reduced the compensatory and punitive damages awards to million and million  respectively and entered judgments in those amounts on november  we thereafter filed a motion for suspensive appeal and posted the required security as required by law 
the proceedings regarding the claims of the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok concluded on july  on november   the court issued separate judgments on those claims that awarded million in compensatory damages to amcare la and million in compensatory damages to amcare ok  respectively 
the court later denied requests by amcare la and amcare ok for attorneys fees and punitive damages 
we thereafter filed motions for suspensive appeals in connection with both judgments and posted the required security as required by law  and the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok each appealed the orders denying them attorneys fees and punitive damages 
our appeals of the judgments in all three cases have been consolidated in the louisiana court of appeal 
on january   the court of appeal vacated on procedural grounds the trial court s judgments denying the amcare la and amcare ok claims for attorney fees and punitive damages  and referred those issues instead to be considered with the merits of the main appeal pending before it 
the court of appeal also has considered and ruled on various other preliminary procedural issues related to the main appeal 
oral argument on the appeals was held on october  decisions by the court on the various appeals are expected to be rendered within six months of the date of oral argument 
on november   we filed a complaint in the us district court for the middle district of louisiana and simultaneously filed an identical suit in the th judicial district court in east baton rouge parish seeking to nullify the three judgments that were rendered against us on the grounds of ill practice which resulted in the judgments entered 
we have alleged that the judgments and other prejudicial rulings rendered in these cases were the result of impermissible ex part contacts between the receivers  their counsel and the trial court during the course of the litigation 
preliminary motions and exceptions have been filed by the receivers for amcare tx  amcare ok and amcare la seeking dismissal of our claim for nullification on various grounds 
the federal magistrate  after considering the briefs of the parties  found that health net had a reasonable basis to infer possible impropriety based on the facts alleged  but also found that the federal court lacked jurisdiction to hear the nullity action and recommended that the suit be dismissed 
the federal judge dismissed health net s federal complaint and health net has appealed to the us fifth circuit court of appeals 
the state court nullity action has been stayed pending the resolution of health net s jurisdictional appeal in the federal action which is scheduled for oral argument on march  we have vigorously contested all of the claims asserted against us by the plaintiffs in the consolidated louisiana actions since they were first filed 
we intend to vigorously pursue all avenues of redress in these cases  including the actions for nullification  post trial motions and appeals  and the prosecution of our pending but stayed cross claims against other parties 
during the three months ended june   we recorded a pretax charge of million representing the estimated legal defense costs for this litigation 
these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their outcome  including the outcome of any appeal  cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
litigation relating to rescission of policies in recent years  there has been growing public attention in california to the practices of health plans and health insurers involving the rescission of members policies for misrepresenting their health status on applications for coverage 
on october   the california department of managed health care dmhc and the california department of insurance doi announced their intention to issue joint regulations limiting 
table of contents the rights of health plans and insurers to rescind coverage 
in addition  effective january   newly enacted legislation in california requires health plans and insurers to pay health care providers who  under certain circumstances  have rendered services to members whose policies are subsequently rescinded 
the issue of rescissions has also attracted increasing media attention  and the dmhc has been conducting surveys of the rescission practices of health plans  including ours 
other government agencies have also announced their interest in investigating rescission and related activities of health plans 
on february   the los angeles city attorney filed a complaint against health net in the los angeles superior court relating to our underwriting practices and rescission of certain individual policies 
the complaint seeks equitable relief and civil penalties for  among other things  alleged false advertising  violations of unfair competition laws and violations of the california penal code 
we are party to arbitrations and litigation in which rescinded members allege that we unlawfully rescinded their coverage 
in addition  we have been threatened with a class action lawsuit that would be brought on behalf of all individuals whose policies were rescinded for misrepresentation 
the lawsuits generally seek not only the cost of medical services that were not paid for as a result of the rescission  but in some cases they also seek damages for emotional distress  attorneys fees and punitive damages 
for example  in patsy bates vs 
health net  inc et al  the claimant brought breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claims against us relating to the rescission of her individual health insurance policy based on the discovery that she suffered from a heart condition that was not disclosed on her application 
on february   the arbitrator in the bates case issued a binding interim arbitration award of approximately million to the claimant for her unpaid medical expenses  emotional distress and punitive damages  and has awarded attorneys fees to the claimant  which amount has yet to be exactly determined 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in each of the unresolved cases involving rescission 
the cases are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and or financial condition could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these cases depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
miscellaneous proceedings we are the subject of a regulatory investigation in new jersey that relates principally to the timeliness and accuracy of our claims payment practices for services rendered by out of network providers 
the regulatory investigation includes an audit of our claims payment practices for services rendered by out of network providers for through in new jersey 
the new jersey department of banking and insurance dobi has informed us that  based on the results of the audit  it will require us to remediate certain claims payments for this period and will assess a regulatory fine against us 
during the three months ended september   we reached an agreement with dobi regarding most of the claims that will require remediation and had preliminary discussions with dobi regarding the fine that it expects to impose 
we expect to finalize an agreement with dobi on the remainder of the claims issues  reach an agreement upon the fine to be assessed and enter into a consent order in the near future 
at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of this regulatory investigation should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
on february   the new york attorney general nyag announced that his office is conducting an industry wide investigation into the manner in which health insurers calculate usual  customary and reasonable charges for purposes of reimbursing members for out of network medical services 
the nyag s office has issued subpoenas to health insurance companies  including us  in connection with this investigation 
as described by the nyag in a press conference on february   the threatened claims appear to be similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs in the mccoy  wachtel and scharfman cases described above 
we intend to respond to the subpoena and cooperate with the nyag as appropriate in his investigation 

table of contents on september   hnnj received notification from njdmahs that it would assess hnnj s provider network panels as of september  and that njdmahs may impose a daily penalty for each network deficiency originally day  potentially to increase to day 
we are actively working to remediate any deficiencies  and the njdmahs has acknowledged our progress in this area 
on november   hnnj received a second notification from njdmahs imposing a daily penalty as of august  originally day  increased to day as of december  against hnnj until we have demonstrated that our continuity of care for care management of certain of our populations is in compliance with contractual requirements 
we have filed objections to and appealed this notice of imposition of liquidated damages on grounds including lack of due process 
hnnj is actively working to remediate any existing deficiencies associated with the continuity of care for care management  and expects to complete these efforts in late in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also subject to periodic reviews by various regulatory agencies with respect to our compliance with a wide variety of rules and regulations applicable to our business  including  without limitation  rules relating to pre authorization penalties  payment of out of network claims and timely review of grievances and appeals  which may result in remediation of certain claims and the assessment of regulatory fines or penalties 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also party to various other legal proceedings  including  without limitation  litigation arising out of our general business activities  such as contract disputes  employment litigation  wage and hour claims  real estate and intellectual property claims and claims brought by members seeking coverage or additional reimbursement for services allegedly rendered to our members  but which allegedly were either denied  underpaid or not paid  and claims arising out of the acquisition or divestiture of various business units or other assets 
we are also subject to claims relating to the performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  employer groups and others  including the alleged failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the manner in which we process claims 
in addition  we are subject to claims relating to the insurance industry in general  such as claims relating to reinsurance agreements and rescission of coverage and other types of insurance coverage obligations 
these other regulatory and legal proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of any or all of these other regulatory and legal proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of all of these other regulatory and legal proceedings that are pending  after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
potential settlements we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described above  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
we have recorded reserves and accrued costs for future legal costs for certain significant matters described above 
these reserves and accrued costs represent our best estimate of probable loss  including related future legal costs for such matters  both known and incurred but not reported  although our recorded amounts might ultimately be inadequate to cover such costs 
therefore  the costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as noted above under class action litigation mccoy v 
health net  inc et al  wachtel v 
health net  inc  et al  and scharfman  et al v 
health net  inc  et al we are in the process of finalizing an agreement to settle the mccoy  wachtel and scharfman cases

how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health care products  manage health care costs  including pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our general and administrative g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the potential effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business  and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our health plan services segment profitability based on medical care ratio mcr and pretax income 
the mcr is calculated as health plan services expense divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premiums and administrative services fees and other income less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our mcr and results of operations health plan services segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 

table of contents health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts  including medicare part d  to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
medicare revenue can also include amounts for risk factor adjustments 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given year is driven by the rates we charge and enrollment levels 
administrative services fees and other income primarily includes revenue for administrative services such as claims processing  customer service  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
health plan services expense includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
general and administrative expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  premium taxes and assessments  occupancy costs and litigation and regulatory related costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products  system consolidations and compliance requirements for changing regulations 
these expenses also include expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support the health plan services segment 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 
we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on government contracts cost ratio and pretax income 
the government contracts cost ratio is calculated as government contracts cost divided by government contracts revenue 
the pretax income is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our government contracts cost ratio and results of operations government contracts segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 
government contracts revenue is made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component includes revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims ibnr expenses for which we are at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care

table of contents the bridge loan agreement on march   partially funded by a million draw on our million revolving credit facility 
statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements  in all material respects 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
we generally manage our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital above of acl  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
at december   we had sufficient capital to exceed this level 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash or other assets to the parent company 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of million to various subsidiaries to maintain rbc or other statutory capital requirements 
of this amount  million was directly related to the guardian transaction 
health net  inc did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations thereafter through february  legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus 

table of contents contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations as of december  are summarized below for the years ending december total thereafter dollars in millions long term debt principal long term debt interest valuation of interest rate swap contracts operating leases other purchase obligations fin liabilities  including interest and penalties b deferred compensation a estimated future payments for pension and other benefits a a represents estimated future payments from through b the fin obligations shown above represent tax positions expected to be paid within the reporting periods presented 
in addition to the obligations shown above  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as a liability in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled or paid 
operating leases we lease office space under various operating leases 
certain leases are cancelable with substantial penalties 
see item properties for additional information regarding our leases 
on march   we sold our acre commercial campus in shelton  connecticut the shelton property to the dacourt group  inc dacourt and leased it back from dacourt under an operating lease agreement for an initial term of ten years with an option to extend for two additional terms of ten years each 
on june   we entered into the lease agreement in connection with a sale leaseback transaction involving certain of our assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these sale leaseback transactions 
other purchase obligations other purchase obligations include payments due under agreements for goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have included in the table above  obligations related to a three year pharmacy benefit services agreement  a five year agreement for a nurse advice line and other related services  a five year agreement for a disease and condition management services and a three year agreement for outsourcing services for our prescription drug plan and private fee for service products 
we have excluded from such table amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from such table various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 

table of contents the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 
surety bonds in order to secure judgment pending our appeal in the amcareco litigation  we obtained surety bonds totaling million  which are further secured by letters of credit issued in december in the amounts of million

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a and the instructions thereto 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premiums include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts including part d to provide care and services to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
we have an arrangement with cms for certain of our medicare products whereby periodic changes in our risk factor adjustment scores for certain diagnostic codes result in changes to our health plan services premium revenues 
we recognize such changes when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also have risk sharing arrangements under our medicare contracts where variances in our actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our contracts are shared 
from time to time  we make adjustments to our revenues based on retroactivity 
these retroactivity adjustments reflect changes in the number of enrollees subsequent to when the revenue is billed 
we estimate the amount of future retroactivity each period and accordingly adjust the billed revenue 
the estimated adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of contract renewal activity during the period and other information 
we refine our estimates and methodologies as information on actual retroactivity becomes available 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the 
table of contents recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 
reserves for claims and other settlements include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves 
as of december   of reserves for claims and other settlements were attributed to claims reserves 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed in the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims is highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 

table of contents other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most recent months 
in developing its best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology described above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims includes various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claims processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
hn of california  our california hmo  generally contracts with various medical groups to provide professional care to certain of its members on a capitated  or fixed per member per month fee basis 
capitation contracts generally include a provision for stop loss and non capitated services for which we are liable 
professional capitated contracts also generally contain provisions for shared risk 
we have risk sharing arrangements with certain of our providers related to approximately  members  primarily in the california commercial market 
shared risk arrangements provide for us to share with our providers the variance between actual costs and predetermined goals 
our hmos in other states also contract with hospitals  physicians and other providers of health care  pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements  hospital per diems  and case rates under which providers bill the hmos for each individual service provided to enrollees 
additionally  we contract with certain hospitals to provide hospital care to enrolled members on a capitation basis 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include premium yield and health care cost trend assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held no premium deficiency reserves as of december  government contracts the tricare north region contract is made up of two major revenue components  health care and administrative services 
health care services revenue includes health care costs  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses  for care provided for which we are at risk and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
administrative services revenue encompasses all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contracts with the government 
health care costs and associated revenues are recognized as the costs are incurred and the associated revenue is earned 
revenue related to administrative services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
revenues associated with the transition to the tricare contract for the north region are recognized over the entire term of the contract 
there are different variables that impact the estimate of the ibnr reserves for our tricare business than those that impact our managed care businesses 
these variables consist of changes in the level of our nation s military activity  including the call up of reservists in support of heightened military activity  continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the health care facilities in which the eligible beneficiaries 
table of contents seek treatment  and revisions to the provisions of the contract in the form of change orders 
each of these factors is subject to significant judgment  and we have incorporated our best estimate of these factors in estimating the reserve for ibnr claims 
as part of our tricare contract for the north region  we have a risk sharing arrangement with the federal government whereby variances in actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid are shared 
due to this risk sharing arrangement provided for in the tricare contract for the north region  the changes in the estimate of the ibnr reserves are not expected to have a material effect on the favorable or adverse development of our liability under the tricare contract 
other government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
under our tricare contract for the north region we recognize amounts receivable and payable under the government contracts related to estimated health care ibnr expenses which are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  these amounts are the same since all of the estimated health care ibnr expenses incurred are offset by an equal amount of revenues earned 
some of the amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of contractually defined billings  deferred underwriting fees under the terms of the contract and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
our policy is to defer the costs as incurred until we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  at which time we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
in the normal course of contracting with the federal government  we may make claims for contract and price adjustments arising from cost overruns against the government 
we recognize such claims when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices that expose us to potential losses 
we recognize an estimated loss  which may represent damages  settlement costs  future legal expenses or a combination of the foregoing  as appropriate  from such loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of various business acquisitions and consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets consist of the value of employer group contracts  provider networks and customer relationships 
we perform our annual impairment test on our recorded goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization as of june or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of these assets for each of our reporting units 
health plans services is our only 
table of contents reporting unit with goodwill as of december  and we test goodwill for impairment annually based on the estimated fair value of our health plan services reporting unit 
we test for impairment on a more frequent basis in cases where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of goodwill 
our measurement of fair value is based on the income approach to fair value determination 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based upon converting expected cash flows to present value 
annual cash flows are estimated for each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting process as well as the weighted average cost of capital used in the discounting process 
if these planned initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets held for sale long lived assets are classified as held for sale as part of current assets when certain criteria are met  which include management commitment to a plan to sell the assets  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets have been initiated  whether the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
we measure long lived assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices or the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale we classify an asset or asset group that will be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until the disposal transaction occurs 
the asset or asset group continues to be depreciated based on revisions to its estimated useful life until the date of disposal or abandonment 

table of contents recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the remaining period of use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions 
often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a liability for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination  in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted as of january  prior to  we maintained a liability pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation requires us to analyze the amount at which each tax position meets a more likely than not standard for sustainability upon examination by taxing authorities 
only tax benefit amounts meeting or exceeding this standard will be reflected in tax provision expense and deferred tax asset balances 
the interpretation also requires that any differences between the amounts of tax benefits reported on tax returns and tax benefits reported in the financial statements be recorded in a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reported separately from deferred tax assets and liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon the expected period of payment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to fin policies and the impact of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception that will affect the value of financial instruments 
we have several bond portfolios to fund reserves 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 

table of contents we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
except for those securities held by trustees or regulatory agencies see note to our consolidated financial statements  all of our investment securities are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
virtually  all of our investment securities are fixed income securities 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to increase 
in addition  approximately of our available for sale investment securities are mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities abs 
over of the mbs is collateralized by mortgages which are backed by federal agencies 
therefore  we believe that our exposure to credit related market value risk for our mbs is limited 
these securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments 
however  such disruptions did not have a material impact to the liquidity of our investments
