management overview of reportable operating segments the company is a multinational company that provides sophisticated drilling and construction services and related products to a variety of markets  as well as being a producer of unconventional natural gas for the energy market 
management defines the company s operational organizational structure into discrete divisions based on its primary product lines 
each division comprises a combination of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar types of services and serve similar types of markets 
although individual offices within a division may periodically perform services normally provided by another division  the results of those services are recorded in the office s own division 
for example  if a mineral exploration division office performed water well drilling services  the revenues would be recorded in the mineral exploration division rather than the water infrastructure division 
the company s reportable segments are defined as follows water infrastructure this division provides a full line of water related services and products including hydrological studies  site selection  well design  drilling and well development  pump installation  and well rehabilitation 
the division s offerings include the design and construction of water treatment facilities and the provision of filter media and membranes to treat volatile organics and other contaminants such as nitrates  iron  manganese  arsenic  radium and radon in groundwater 
the division also offers environmental drilling services to assess and monitor groundwater contaminants 
through internal growth and several recent acquisitions  the division has continued to expand its capabilities in the areas of the design and build of water and wastewater treatment plants  ranney collector wells  water treatment product research and development  sewer rehabilitation and water and wastewater transmission lines 
the division s operations rely heavily on the municipal sector as approximately of the division s fiscal revenues were derived from the municipal market 
the municipal sector can be adversely impacted by economic slowdowns in certain regions of the country 
reduced tax revenues can limit spending and new development by local municipalities 
generally  spending levels in the municipal sector lag an economic recovery 
mineral exploration division this division provides a complete range of drilling services for the mineral exploration industry 
its aboveground and underground drilling activities include all phases of core drilling  diamond  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the division relies heavily on mining activity in africa where of total division revenues were generated for fiscal the company believes this concentration of risk is mitigated by working for larger international mining companies and the establishment of permanent operating facilities in africa 
operating difficulties  including but not limited to  political instability  workforce instability  harsh environment  disease and remote locations  all create natural barriers to entry in this market by competitors 
the company believes it has positioned itself as the market leader in africa and has established the infrastructure to operate effectively 

table of contents energy division this division focuses on the exploration and production of unconventional gas properties 
this division has primarily been concentrated on projects in the mid continent region of the united states  however  in fiscal  it began an exploration project in chile 
the expansion of the company s energy segment is contingent upon significant cash investments to develop the company s unproved acreage 
as of january   the company has invested  in oil and gas related assets and expects to spend approximately  in development activities in fiscal the production curve for a typical unconventional gas well in the company s operating market is generally years 
accordingly  the company expects to earn a return on its investment through proceeds from gas production over the next years 
however  future revenues and profits will be dependent upon a number of factors including consumption levels for natural gas  commodity prices  the economic feasibility of gas exploration and production and the discovery rate of new gas reserves 
the company has net producing wells on line as of january  other other includes two small specialty energy service companies and any other specialty operations not included in one of the other divisions

income from continuing operations for the mineral exploration division increased to  for the year ended january   compared to  for the year ended january  the improved earnings were attributable to the impact of increased exploration activity in most of the company s markets and increased earnings by the company s latin american affiliates of  in addition  in january the division recognized a gain of  on the sale of its interest in a mineral concession 
the improved earnings were partially offset by an increase in accrued incentive compensation of  due to higher profitability in the current year 

table of contents energy in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest energy division revenues increased to  for the year ended january  compared to revenues of  for the year ended january  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased production from the company s unconventional gas properties 
the division had income from continuing operations of  for the year ended january   compared to a  for the year ended january  the increase in income from continuing operations was due to the increase in production noted above 
other in thousands fiscal years ended january  revenues income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest the increases in revenues and income from continuing operations as compared to the prior year were primarily due to a non recurring contract to provide equipment and supplies to an international oil exploration company 
revenues of  were recognized during  primarily in the second quarter  as the equipment and supplies were delivered and accepted 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase for the year was primarily due to the recognition of compensation expense under sfas r of  and increases in wage and benefit costs of  accrued incentive compensation of  and consulting services of  fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling and construction activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to project sites  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
inflation management does not believe that the company s operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its business segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding capital expenditures 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company maintains an agreement the master shelf agreement whereby it has  of unsecured notes available to be issued before september  at january   the company has  in notes outstanding under the master shelf agreement 
additionally  the company holds an unsecured  revolving credit facility the credit agreement

the company s working capital as of january   and  was   and  respectively 
the increase in working capital in the current year was attributable to remaining proceeds of the company s october stock offering 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet the company s 
table of contents operating cash requirements and to fund its budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal operating activities cash from operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth over the last two years was primarily due to increased earnings and related increases in accounts payable  accrued incentive compensation and income taxes payable 
operating cash is normally required in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year when such accrued items are paid 
investing activities the company s capital expenditures  net of disposals  of  for the year ended january   were more heavily weighted toward its water infrastructure and minerals divisions rather than unconventional gas exploration and production 
expenditures were made in those two divisions during the year to sustain capacity and improve efficiency of the equipment 
unconventional gas expenditures declined to  as the company maintained its us operations while carefully considering its expansion efforts on its exploration concession in chile 
also  during the year  the company spent  to complete two acquisitions to complement its water infrastructure division 
the company s capital expenditures  net of disposals  of  for the year ended january   were directed primarily toward the company s expansion into unconventional gas exploration and production 
the expenditures related to the company s unconventional gas efforts totaled  including the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure near the company s development projects 
also  during the year  the company invested  to acquire the business of uig   to acquire the business of collector wells international  inc   to acquire certain producing oil and gas properties and mineral interests  and paid cash purchase price adjustments in accordance with the reynolds purchase agreement of  the company s capital expenditures  net of disposals  of  for fiscal were directed primarily toward the company s expansion into unconventional gas exploration and production 
expenditures related to the company s unconventional gas efforts totaled  during fiscal including the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure near the company s development projects 
the company also acquired two unconventional gas projects totaling  and acquired the remaining interest in a gas transportation facility for  also in fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of reynolds for total consideration of  in cash and approximately million shares of common stock of the company 
reynolds is a major supplier of products and services to the water and wastewater industries including the design build of water and wastewater treatment plants  water supply wells  ranney collector wells  water intakes and water and wastewater transmission lines see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
financing activities in october  the company completed a public offering of its common stock 
the offering produced net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to repay the then outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving bank credit facility and to build funds for potential future acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
for the year ended january   the company had net borrowings of  under its credit facilities primarily to fund the acquisition of uig  working capital requirements and capital expenditures

in fiscal  the company had net borrowings of  under its credit facilities primarily for the reynolds acquisition  working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures 
additionally  proceeds of  were received from issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options 
the increase in the exercise of stock options in fiscal was due to increases in the company s stock price and a number of options with impending expiration dates 
financing activities also include payments of  related to a promissory note  which was paid in full in fiscal 
table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january   are summarized as follows in thousands payments expiration by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations and other commercial commitments credit agreement principal payments senior notes principal payments interest payments operating leases mineral interest obligations income tax uncertainties total cash contractual obligations standby letters of credit asset retirement obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company expects to meet its contractual cash obligation in the ordinary course of operations  and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process

the ultimate timing of resolution of these items is uncertain  and accordingly the amounts have not been included in the table above 
the company incurs additional obligations in the ordinary course of operations 
these obligations  including but not limited to  income tax payments and pension fundings are expected to be met in the normal course of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  located in item of this form k 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized on large  long term construction contracts meeting the criteria of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  using the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  change orders and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as allowed by sop  revenue is recognized on smaller  short term construction contracts using the completed contract method 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
revenues for direct sales of equipment and other ancillary products not provided in conjunction with the performance of construction contracts are recognized at the date of delivery to  and acceptance by  the customer 
provisions for estimated warranty obligations are made in the period in which the sales occur 
contracts for the company s mineral exploration drilling services are billable based on the quantity of drilling performed 
thus  revenues for these drilling contracts are recognized on the basis of actual footage or meterage drilled 
revenues for the sale of oil and gas by the company s energy division are recognized on the basis of volumes sold at the time of delivery to an end user or an interstate pipeline  net of amounts attributable to royalty or working interest holders 
the company s revenues are presented net of taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions with its customers  such as  but not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
oil and gas properties and mineral interests the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 

table of contents under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
separate full cost pools are established for each country in which the company has exploration activities 
the company is required to review the carrying value of its oil and gas properties each quarter under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenues at the unescalated prices in effect as of the last day of the period  with effect given to the company s fixed price physical delivery contracts  and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis using a comparison of the carrying values of the unproved properties to net future cash flows 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of natural gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
goodwill and other intangibles the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years 
the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the impairment evaluation of the carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives is conducted annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by comparing the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets with indefinite lives  then an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
other long lived assets in the event of an indication of possible impairment  the company evaluates the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  including the company s gas transportation facilities and equipment  by performing an analysis of the anticipated future net cash flows of the related long lived assets and reducing their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
the company believes at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of its long lived assets continues to be appropriate 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a self insured limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated 
table of contents based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee health and welfare benefits  property  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of funds considered to be invested indefinitely 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk on variable rate debt  foreign exchange rate risk that could give rise to translation and transaction gains and losses and fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
the company centrally manages its debt portfolio considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s debt is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as of january   an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would not change the company s annual interest expense as we have no variable rate debt outstanding 
operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico and italy 
the operations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s affiliates also operate in south america and mexico see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company also may utilize various hedge instruments  primarily foreign currency option contracts  to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of january   the company held no hedge instruments 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
this represents approximately of the income from continuing operations of international businesses after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated statements of income reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican and african operations which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains losses for the years ended january   and  were   and  respectively
