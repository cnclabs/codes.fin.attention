executive overview we are a leading media and news organization serving our audiences through print  online  mobile and radio technology 
our segments and divisions are

our revenues were billion in the percentage of revenues contributed by division is below

other revenues  which make up the remainder of its revenues  primarily consist of revenues from wholesale delivery operations  news services syndication  commercial printing  advertising service revenue  digital archives  timesselect for periods before october  baseline and rental income 
the news media group s main operating costs are employee related costs and raw materials  primarily newsprint 
executive overview the new york times company p 
news media group revenues in by category and percentage share are below 

j dajpg 
about group the about group principally generates revenues from display advertising that is relevant to its adjacent content  cost per click advertising sponsored links for which the about group is paid when a user clicks on the ad  and e commerce including sales lead generation 
almost all of its revenues in are derived from the sale of advertisements display and cost per click advertising 
display advertising accounted for of the about group s total advertising revenues 
the about group s main operating costs are employee related costs and content and hosting costs 
joint ventures our investments accounted for under the equity method are as follows a interest in metro boston  which publishes a free daily newspaper in the greater boston area  a interest in a canadian newsprint company  malbaie  a interest in a partnership  madison  operating a supercalendered paper mill in maine  and an approximately interest in nesv  which owns the boston red sox  fenway park and adjacent real estate  approximately of the new england sports network  a regional cable sports network  and of roush fenway racing  a leading nascar team 
broadcast media group on may   we sold the broadcast media group  consisting of nine network affiliated television stations  their related web sites and the digital operating center  for approximately million 
this decision was a result of our ongoing analysis of our business portfolio and has allowed us to place an even greater emphasis on developing and integrating our print and growing digital businesses 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of million million after tax  or 
per share in  and we used the cash proceeds from the sale to repay our outstanding commercial paper obligation 
the broadcast media group is no longer included as a separate reportable segment of the company 
in accordance with fas  the broadcast media group s results of operations are presented as discontinued operations and certain assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale for all periods presented before the group s sale 
business environment we operate in the highly competitive media industry 
we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have had  and will continue to have  a fundamental effect on our business and prospects 
these include increasing competition competition for advertising revenue that our businesses face affects our ability both to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates 
we expect technological developments will continue to favor digital media choices  intensifying the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 
we have expanded and will continue to expand our digital offerings  however  most of our revenues are currently from traditional print products 
our print advertising revenues have declined 
we believe that this decline  particularly in classified advertising  is due to a shift to digital media or to other forms of media and marketing 
economic conditions our advertising revenues  which account for approximately of our news media group revenues  are susceptible to economic swings 
national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  as well as in florida and california  affect the levels of our national  classified and retail advertising revenue 
in addition  a significant portion of our advertising revenues comes from studio entertainment  financial services  telecommunications  real estate and department store advertising 
real estate advertising  our largest classified category  was affected  and continues to be affected  by the nationwide slowdown in the housing market 
consolidation among key advertisers and changes in spending practices or priorities has depressed  and may continue to depress  our advertising revenue 
we believe that categories that have historically generated significant amounts of advertising revenues for our businesses are likely to continue to be challenged in these include telecommunications and real estate advertising 
p 
annual report executive overview circulation circulation is another significant source of revenue for us 
in recent years  we  along with the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced difficulty increasing circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from new media formats and sources  and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news from sources other than a newspaper 
costs our most significant costs are employee related costs and raw materials  which together account for approximately of total costs 
changes in the price of newsprint or in employee related costs can materially affect our operating results 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition  see forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
our strategy we anticipate that the challenges we currently face will continue  and we believe that the following elements are key to our efforts to address them 
new products and services we are addressing the increasingly fragmented media landscape by building on the strength of our brands  particularly of the new york times 
because of our high quality content  we have very powerful and trusted brands that attract educated  affluent and influential audiences 
to further leverage these brands  we have introduced and will continue to introduce a number of new products and services in print and online 
we want to offer our customers news  information and entertainment wherever and whenever our audience want it and even in some ways they may not have envisioned in print or online  wireless or mobile  in text  graphics  audio  radio  video or even live events 
in  our new products and services included new specialty magazines and print publications in new york  boston and at the iht  new print ad formats  and the expansion of the t magazine franchise in print  online and internationally 
growth in digital operations online  our goal is to grow our digital businesses by broadening our audiences  deepening engagement and monetizing the usage of our sites 
we have a more diversified revenue base mainly because nytimes 
com attracts a diverse base of national advertisers and about 
com generates most of its revenues from display and cost per click advertising 
our goal for nytimes 
com is to build a fully interactive  news and information platform  achieving sustainable leadership positions in our most profitable content areas or verticals 
we have made and plan to continue to make investments to grow our web sites that have the highest advertiser demand 
in  we concentrated on building out nytimes 
com s verticals in health  business and technology 
we also strengthened our verticals at the about group with acquisitions  particularly in health and increased editorial content by adding guides 
we redesigned boston 
com and formed a strategic alliance with monster worldwide  inc to further build our online recruitment product offerings and enabled our online advertisers to buy across all our web sites 
in  we acquired ucomparehealthcare 
com  a site that provides consumers with access to quality ratings and related information on hospitals  nursing homes and doctors  and consumersearch 
com  a leading online aggregator and publisher of reviews of consumer products 
all of these acquisitions leverage the about group s audience scale by delivering traffic and more advertising opportunities to these sites 
research and development capabilities we are also trying to capitalize on the capabilities of our research and development team 
this group stimulates innovation and cultural change as we rebalance our businesses for a more digital world 
it anticipates consumer preferences and devises ways to satisfy them 
our r d team has helped to create new products and improve our brands  such as nytimes 
com s launch of a new product that allows readers to send and receive real estate listings on their mobile devices  develop new capabilities such as data mining and web analytics  and pursue new relationships with leading web entities  which should contribute to more cost per click advertising  increased presence on the web and search services channeling traffic to our web sites 
rebalanced portfolio we continually evaluate our businesses to determine whether they are meeting our targets for financial performance  growth and return on investment and whether they remain relevant to our strategy 
as a result of this analysis  in april  we sold a radio station wqew am and in may we sold our broadcast media group in order to allow us to focus on developing our print and digital businesses 
we have made selective acquisitions and investments in  such as the acquisitions of consumersearch 
com and ucomparehealthcare 
com  consistent with our commitment to developing our digital businesses 
executive overview the new york times company p 
cost management managing costs is a key component of our strategy 
we continuously review our cost structure to ensure that we are operating our businesses efficiently 
our focus is on streamlining our operations and achieving cost benefits from productivity gains 
to reduce distribution costs and expand national circulation we added another print site for the new york times in salt lake city in  and a site in dallas in january  with an additional site scheduled to open later in as part of our efforts to reduce costs  we are in the process of consolidating our new york metro area printing into our newer facility in college point  ny  and closing our older edison  ny  facility 
we expect to complete the plant consolidation in the first quarter of with the plant consolidation  we expect to save million in lower operating costs annually and to avoid the need for approximately million in capital investment at the edison  nj  facility over the next years 
we expect to make capital expenditures in the aggregate of million to million related to the plant consolidation project 
as part of the plant consolidation  we estimate costs to close the edison  nj  facility in the range of million to million  principally consisting of accelerated depreciation charges to million  as well as staff reduction charges to million and plant restoration costs to million 
the majority of these costs have been recognized as of december   with the remaining amount to be recognized in the first quarter of we reduced the size of all editions of the times  the globe  the t g and four of our regional media group papers 
with the web width reductions  we expect to save approximately million annually from decreased newsprint consumption 
we have shifted away from less profitable circulation by reducing promotion  production  distribution and other related costs 
the majority of savings are expected to come from newly identified initiatives that will involve standardizing  streamlining  and consolidating processes and shifting staff to lower cost locations 
the areas that present the greatest opportunity are general and administrative  production  technology  distribution and circulation sales 
expectations the key expectations for are in the table below 
item expectation depreciation amortization to million net income from joint ventures to million interest expense to million capital expenditures to million income tax rate approximately percent includes approximately million of accelerated depreciation expense in the first quarter of associated with the new york area plant consolidation project 
depreciation for the new headquarters building is expected to be million per quarter 
aside from significant projects  other capital spending is projected to be to million 
we believe we can achieve a reduction in cost from our year end cash cost base of a total of approximately million in and  excluding the effects of inflation  staff reduction costs and one time costs 
about million of these savings are expected in p

circulation revenue circulation revenue is based on the number of copies sold and the subscription and single copy rates charged to customers 
at the new york times and our other newspapers  our strategy is to focus promotional spending on individually paid circulation  which is generally more valued by advertisers

the dec plan enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre tax basis

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe our critical accounting policies include our accounting for long lived assets  retirement benefits  stock based compensation  income taxes  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
additional information about these policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
specific risks related to our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
long lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets not amortized are tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  and all other long lived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with fas long lived assets in millions december  december  long lived assets   total assets   percentage of long lived assets to total assets the impairment analysis is considered critical to our segments because of the significance of long lived assets to our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets not amortized on an annual basis or if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
all other long lived assets are tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment exists 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level as defined in fas this test is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value  which is based on future cash flows  exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of each year  we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability  and impairments  if any  are recognized in earnings 
intangible assets that are not amortized eg  mastheads and trade names are tested for impairment at the asset level by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value  which is based on future cash flows  exceeds the carrying amount  the asset is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
all other long lived assets intangible assets that are amortized  such as a subscriber list  and property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment at the asset level associated with the lowest level of cash flows 
an impairment exists if the carrying value critical accounting policies the new york times company p 
of the asset is i not recoverable the carrying value of the asset is greater than the sum of undiscounted cash flows and ii is greater than its fair value 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets are estimated future cash flows  present value discount rate  as well as other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluations of long lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to the testing above  which is done on an annual basis  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying value of its long lived assets may not be recoverable  such as i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a projection forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in the cash flow of an entity or inability of an entity to improve its operations to forecasted levels and ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological  that could affect the value of an entity 
management has applied what it believes to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of its reporting units 
our testing has resulted in impairment charges in and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

as of december   our pension obligation was approximately million net of a pension asset of approximately million  including approximately million  representing the underfunded status of our qualified pension plans  and approximately million  representing the unfunded status of our non qualified pension plans 
of the total net pension obligation  approximately million is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss  of which approximately million represents unrecognized actuarial losses and approximately million represents unrecognized prior service costs 
as of december   our postretirement obligation was approximately million  representing the unfunded status of our postretirement plans 
approximately million of income is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss  of which approximately million represents unrecognized prior service credits  partially offset by approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses 
the amounts recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized through pension or postretirement expense in future periods

pension postretirement liabilities in millions december  december  pension postretirement liabilities total liabilities   percentage of pension postretirement liabilities to total liabilities we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our key retirement benefit assumptions are discussed in further detail under pension and postretirement benefits below

annual report critical accounting policies stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  income taxes are recognized for the following i amount of taxes payable for the current year and ii deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
we adopted fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions tax positions on january  fin required us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions  the evaluation of tax law and an assessment of whether a liability for uncertain tax positions is necessary 
different conclusions reached in this assessment can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
see note for additional information related to the adoption of fin we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities  the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is difficult to predict 
self insurance we self insure for workers compensation costs  certain employee medical and disability benefits  and automobile and general liability claims 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are primarily calculated using actuarial methods 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks were approximately million as of december  and million as of december  accounts receivable allowances credit is extended to our advertisers and subscribers based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition  and collateral is not required from such customers 
we use prior credit losses as a percentage of credit sales  the aging of accounts receivable and specific identification of potential losses to establish reserves for credit losses on accounts receivable

accounts receivable allowances in millions december  december  accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable net accounts receivable gross total current assets  percentage of accounts receivable allowances to gross accounts receivable percentage of net accounts receivable to current assets we consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the percentage of net accounts receivable to current assets is higher in compared with because of the inclusion  in  of broadcast media group s assets as assets held for sale in current assets 
pension and postretirement benefits pension benefits we sponsor several pension plans  and make contributions to several others that are considered multi employer pension plans  in connection with collective bargaining agreements 
these plans cover substantially all employees 
our company sponsored plans include qualified funded plans as well as non qualified unfunded plans 
these plans provide participating employees with retirement benefits in accordance with benefit provision formulas detailed in each plan 
our non qualified plans provide retirement benefits only to certain highly compensated employees 
we also have a foreign based pension plan for certain iht employees the foreign plan 
the information for the foreign plan is combined with the information for us non qualified plans 
the benefit obligation of the foreign plan is immaterial to our total benefit obligation 
pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets for qualified plans and a discount rate 
our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is discussed below 
long term rate of return on assets in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  we evaluated input from our investment consultants  actuaries and investment management firms  including their review of asset class return expectations  as well as long term historical asset class returns 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
additionally  we considered our historical year and year compounded returns  which have been in excess of our forward looking return expectations 
the expected long term rate of return determined on this basis was in we anticipate that our pension assets will generate long term returns on assets of at least 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of  and to with fixed income real estate managers  with an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
our actual asset allocation as of december  was in line with our expectations 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we believe that is a reasonable expected long term rate of return on assets 
our plan assets had a rate of return of approximately for and an average annual rate of return of approximately for the three years ended december  our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation of assets recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
if we had decreased our expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million in for our qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
p 
annual report pension and postretirement benefits see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 
discount rate we select a discount rate utilizing a methodology that equates the plans projected benefit obligations to a present value calculated using the citigroup pension discount curve 
the methodology described above includes producing a cash flow of annual accrued benefits as defined under the projected unit cost method as provided by fas for active participants  service is projected to the end of the current measurement date and benefit earnings are projected to the date of termination 
the projected plan cash flow is discounted to the measurement date using the annual spot rates provided in the citigroup pension discount curve 
a single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash flow on a projected benefit obligation basis as described above equals the present value computed using the citigroup annual rates 
the discount rate determined on this basis increased to as of december  from as of december  for our qualified plans 
the discount rate determined on this basis increased to as of december  from as of december  for our no n qualified plans 
if we had decreased the expected discount rate by in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million for our qualified pension plans and million for our non qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
we will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  including the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rate  and will adjust as necessary 
actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans 
postretirement benefits we provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and their eligible dependents who are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements  if the employees meet specified age and service requirements 
in addition  we contribute to a postretirement plan under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
our policy is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets 
in accordance with fas  we accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees active years of service 
the annual postretirement expense was calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including a health care cost trend rate and a discount rate 
the health care cost trend rate range increased to to as of december  from to as of december  a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates range would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million in our service and interest costs  respectively  two factors included in the calculation of postretirement expense 
a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million  in our accumulated benefit obligation as of december  our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits
