item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a leading direct marketer of a wide range of it products and services including computer systems  software and peripheral equipment  networking communications  and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers  distributors  and other suppliers 
we also offer a growing range of installation  configuration  repair  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
we operate through three primary business segments a consumers and small to medium sized businesses  or smbs  through our pc connection sales subsidiaries  b large corporate accounts  or large account  through our moredirect subsidiary  and c federal  state  and local government and educational institutions  or public sector  through our govconnection subsidiary 
we generate sales through i outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by account managers focused on the business  education  and government markets  ii our websites  and iii inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising media 
as a value added reseller in the it supply chain  we do not manufacture it hardware or software 
we are dependent on our suppliers that consist of manufacturers and distributors that historically have sold only to resellers rather than end users 
certain manufacturers have on many occasions attempted to sell directly to our customers  thereby eliminating our role 
consolidation in this industry is more evident than ever  as further streamlining of our supply chain occurs 
if more of our suppliers were to succeed in selling to our customers directly  including the electronic distribution of software products  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be negatively affected 
market conditions and technology advances significantly affect the demand for our products and services 
virtual delivery of software products and advanced internet technology providing customers enhanced functionality have substantially increased customer expectations  requiring us to invest more heavily in our own it development to meet these new demands 
as buying trends change and electronic commerce continues to grow  customers become more sophisticated and have more choices than ever before 
customers are also better able to make price comparisons through the internet  thereby increasing price competition 
these conditions could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the primary challenges we face in effectively managing our business are increasing our revenues in the face of increasing competition while also improving our gross profit margins in all three business segments  recruiting  retaining  and improving the productivity of our sales personnel  and effectively managing and leveraging our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses over a higher sales base 
with only moderate growth projected in the overall it industry  any significant sales growth for us must come through increased market share 
competition is expected to be even more intense in the future  which could put more pressure on margins 
we believe that most of our customers are seeking total it solutions  rather than simply specific it products 
through the formation of our services subsidiary  proconnection  inc  we are able to provide customers complete it solutions  from identifying their needs  to designing  developing  and managing the integration of products and services to implement their it projects 
such service offerings carry much higher margins than traditional product sales 
additionally  the technical certifications of our service engineers permit us to offer higher end  more complex products that also carry higher gross margins 
we expect these service 
table of contents offerings and technical certifications to continue to play a role in sales generation and gross margins in this competitive environment 
we seek to recruit  retain  and increase the productivity of our sales personnel through training  mentoring  financial incentives based on performance  and updating and streamlining our information systems to make our operations more efficient 
we are currently undertaking a major modification and upgrade of our sales order processing and customer management system  scheduled for implementation mid  that is expected to improve sales productivity 
we actively monitor and manage our expense structure in order to obtain better leverage of our operating costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net sales in millions net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges income from operations all three of our business segments experienced year over year sales growth in compared to  with public sector sales increasing by in  and our smb and large account segments sales increasing by and  respectively 
gross profit margins were level year over year in compared to operating margins improved year over year in due to improved personnel expense leverage and cost reductions in certain operating expenses  as discussed later 
sales distribution the following table sets forth our percentage of net sales by business segment and product mix years ended december  business segment smb large account public sector total product mix notebooks and pdas desktop servers storage devices software net com products printers and printer supplies video  imaging and sound memory and system enhancements accessories other total 
table of contents gross profit margins the following table summarizes our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of net sales  for the last three years years ended december  segment smb large account public sector total consolidated gross profit dollars increased in by million compared to primarily due to increased net sales  as consolidated gross profit margins was largely unchanged year over year 
higher agency fee revenues and increased vendor consideration recorded as a reduction to cost of sales were largely offset by lower invoice product margins in compared to gross margins benefited in the year ended december  from our recording of substantially all vendor consideration as a reduction to cost of inventory purchases 
as advertising programs with our vendor partners have become more comprehensive  we have classified substantially all vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of inventory purchases rather than a reduction of advertising expense 
accordingly  this additional consideration in accounted for a basis point increase in gross margin and in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales  compared to cost of sales and certain other costs cost of sales includes the invoice cost of the product  direct costs of packaging  inbound and outbound freight  and provisions for inventory obsolescence  adjusted for discounts  rebates  and other vendor allowances  including those pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
direct operating expenses relating to our purchasing function and receiving  inspection  internal transfer  warehousing  packing and shipping  and other operating expenses of our distribution center are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities who include all of the operating costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold 
such costs  as a percentage of net sales for the years reported  are as follows years ended december  
table of contents operating expenses the following table breaks out our more significant operating expenses for the last three years in millions of dollars years ended december  personnel costs advertising  net facilities operations credit card fees depreciation and amortization professional fees bad debts other net total percentage of net sales we improved operating income in compared to and  largely due to our success in managing overall operating costs 
while we plan to continue our focus on controlling discretionary expenditures  we expect that our sg a expense may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as enhancing our sales training  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation technology to support the sales organization 
personnel costs represent the majority of our operating expenses  with sales personnel representing the largest portion of these costs 
the year over year increase in personnel costs resulted primarily from increased variable compensation related to higher gross profits 
except for bad debt expense and credit card fees  our other operating costs tend to be relatively fixed over changing sales levels 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in our catalogs or fund other advertising activities for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expenses 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory in accordance with eitf issue no 
gross advertising and marketing allowances received from vendors were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we classified million  million  and million of these allowances as offsets to cost of sales or inventory for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our net advertising expense  included in sg a  has been accordingly higher in each successive year

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been internally generated funds from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business  and in our amherst transaction 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit and inventory trade credit agreements  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditure  and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 
we expect our capital needs for to consist primarily of capital expenditures of to million and payments on capital and contractual obligations of approximately million 
we expect to meet our cash requirements for through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  borrowings on our bank line of credit  as follows cash on hand 
at december   we had approximately million in unrestricted accounts 
cash generated from operations 
we expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and balancing net changes in inventories and receivables with compensating changes in payables to generate a positive cash flow 
historically  we have consistently generated positive cash flows from operations 
credit facilities 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding against our million bank line of credit 
this line of credit can be increased  at our option  to million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank 
borrowings are  however  limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements  as described more fully below 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations  if demand for it products declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected

cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and an increase in accounts payable  offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence  except for accounts providing for discounts for early payments 
such payments will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under inventory trade credit agreements we use to finance our purchase of certain inventory  secured by the inventory so financed 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
cash used for investing activities decreased in compared to these activities include our capital expenditures in the three years presented  primarily for computer equipment and capitalized internally developed software

debt instruments  contractual agreements  and related covenants below is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities and other contractual obligations 
for more information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and inventory financing agreements  see factors affecting sources of liquidity 
for more information about our obligations  commitments  and contingencies  see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
bank line of credit 
our bank line of credit provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to million 
in addition  we have the option to increase the facility  as amended on october   by an additional million  based on sufficient levels of trade receivables to meet borrowing base requirements  and depending on meeting minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and equity requirements  described below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
the facility also gives us the option of obtaining eurodollar rate loans in multiples of million for various short term durations 
substantially all of our assets are collateralized as security for this facility  and all of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the line of credit 
at december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
this facility matures in october  operates under an automatic cash management program whereby disbursements in excess of available cash are added as borrowings at the time disbursement checks clear the bank  and available cash receipts are first applied against any outstanding borrowings and then invested in short term qualified cash investments 
accordingly  borrowings under the line are classified as current 

table of contents inventory trade credit agreements 
we have security agreements with two financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
these agreements allow a collateralized first position in certain branded products inventory financed by these financial institutions 
although the agreements provide for up to financing on the purchase price  up to an aggregate of million  any outstanding financing must be fully secured by available inventory 
we do not pay any interest or discount fees on such inventory financing  such costs are borne by the suppliers as an incentive for us to purchase their products 
amounts outstanding under such facilities  equal to million as of december   are recorded in accounts payable  and the inventory financed is classified as inventory on the consolidated balance sheet 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our long term obligations payable in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations sports marketing commitments total including interest  excluding taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
excluding taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
capital leases 
we have a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company related through common ownership 
in addition to the rent payable under the facility lease  we are required to pay real estate taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
operating leases 
we also lease facilities from our principal stockholders and facilities and equipment from third parties under non cancelable operating leases 
see contractual obligations above for lease commitments under these leases 
sports marketing commitments 
we have entered into multi year sponsorship agreements with the boston red sox and the new england patriots that extend to and  respectively 
these agreements  which grant us various marketing rights and seating arrangements  require annual payments aggregating from million to million per year 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 

table of contents factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies  timely collection of our customer receivables  and management of our inventory levels 
bank line of credit 
our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including restrictions on additional debt  guarantees  stock repurchases  dividends and other distributions  investments  and liens with which we and all of our subsidiaries must comply 
any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit  but would also constitute a default 
this credit facility contains two financial tests the funded debt ratio defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter  divided by the consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters must not be more than to our actual funded debt ratio at december   was less than to minimum consolidated net worth must be at least million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter  beginning with the quarter ended march  loss quarters not counted 
such amount was calculated at december   as million  whereas our actual consolidated stockholders equity at this date was million 
the borrowing base under this facility is set at of qualified commercial receivables  plus of qualified government receivables 
as of december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
inventory trade credit agreements 
these agreements contain similar financial ratios and operational covenants and restrictions as those contained in our bank line of credit described above 
such agreements also contain cross default provisions whereby a default under the bank agreement would also constitute a default under these agreements 
financing under these agreements is limited to the purchase of specific branded products from authorized suppliers  and amounts outstanding must be fully collateralized by inventories of those products on hand 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the information technology industry  our financial performance and stock price  and the state of the capital markets 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec requires that all registrants disclose their most critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy has been defined as one that is both important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
further  critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
we have reviewed our policies for the year ended december   and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring to the customer at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination specifically set out in our arrangements with federal agencies and certain commercial customers  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at delivery and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on significant historical experience 
we record our sales reserves as offsets to accounts receivable and  for customers who have already paid  as credits to accrued expenses 
at december   we recorded sales reserves of million and million as components of accounts receivable and accrued expenses  respectively 
at december   we recorded sales reserves of million and million as components of accounts receivable and accrued expenses  respectively 
all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling  if any  represent revenues earned for the goods provided  and these amounts have been classified as net sales 
costs related to such shipping and handling billings are classified as cost of sales 
revenue for third party service contracts are recorded on a net sales recognition basis because we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership in these transactions 
for such contracts  we evaluate whether the sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales as required under the guidelines described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under gross sales recognition  we are the primary obligor  and the entire selling process is recorded in sales with our cost to the third party service provider recorded as a cost of sales 
under net sales recognition  we are not the primary obligor  and the cost to the third party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales  with no cost of goods sold  thus leaving the entire gross profit as the reported net sale for the transaction 
similarly  we recognize revenue from agency sales transactions on a net sales basis 
in agency sales transactions  we facilitate product sales by equipment and software manufacturers directly to our customers and receive agency  or referral  fees for such transactions 
we do not take title to the products or assume any maintenance or return obligations in these transactions  title is passed directly from the supplier to our customer 
net amounts included in revenue for such third party service contracts and agency sales transactions were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
although service revenues represent a small percentage of our consolidated revenues  we offer a growing range of services  including installation  configuration  repair  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
if a service is performed in conjunction with the delivery of hardware  software  or another service  then we recognize the revenue in such multiple deliverable arrangements  in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in these arrangements  we recognize revenue for each element of the sale  if the following three conditions are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  
table of contents there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially under our control 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current creditworthiness 
our allowance is generally computed by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings 
our cash flows would be impacted to the extent that receivables could not be collected 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  an unanticipated change in a promotional program could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur additional charges in the future on our consolidated statements of income 
vendor allowances we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for price protections  discounts  product rebates  and other programs 
these allowances are treated as a reduction of the vendor s prices and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory  as applicable 
we also receive vendor co op advertising funding for our catalogs and other programs 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in the catalogs or fund other advertising activities for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of the underlying incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expense on the consolidated statements of income 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of inventory purchases in accordance with eitf the level of allowances received from certain merchandise vendors has declined in past years and may do so again 
such a decline could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 
inventories merchandise inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems and peripheral equipment are stated at cost determined under the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving  and non salable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions 
this could negatively impact our earnings 
our obsolescence charges have historically ranged between million and million per annum 
historically  there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 

table of contents contingencies from time to time we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we are also subject to audits by states on sales and income taxes  unclaimed property  and other assessments 
a multi state unclaimed property audit is in progress  and certain sales tax audits may be imminent 
while management believes that known liabilities have been adequately provided for  it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits 
such outcome could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from such assets may be diminished 
we may review the carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance  and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
over the last several years  we have incurred no impairment charges 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially effect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits our employee compensation model has several elements that we consider variable 
these include our obligation to our employees for health care 
we have selected a plan that results in our being self insured up to certain stop loss limits 
accordingly  we have to estimate the amount of health care claims outstanding at a given point in time 
these estimates are based on historical experience and could be subject to change 
such change could negatively impact both our earnings and our cash flows 
we have also engaged in workforce reduction actions in recent years 
these actions included formula driven termination benefits 
these benefits were or are being paid relatively quickly and have not been subject to change 
we do not foresee a circumstance where there could be significant variability in our workforce reduction estimates 
however  if we did experience significant variability  such change could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows 

table of contents share based compensation prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the intrinsic value method requires that compensation expense be measured by the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the strike price of the option as of a measurement date 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
sfas r requires a company to measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees and recognize that cost  adjusted for forfeitures  over the period that such services are performed in its consolidated financial statements described in note 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures experienced differ from these estimates 
under the modified prospective application method  financial results for the prior periods have not been adjusted 
we used the criteria in sfas r to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation 
income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future  based on enacted tax laws and rates anticipated to be applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
on january   we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
recently issued financial accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb concluded that it should defer the effective date of sfas for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas which permits companies to voluntarily choose  at specified election dates  to measure specified financial instruments and other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis 
subsequent changes in fair value will be required to be reported in earnings each reporting period 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the foreseeable future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
no borrowings were outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december   and our average outstanding borrowing during was minimal 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material
