item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ebitda for a discussion of the pro forma calculation of adjusted ebitda margin and the reconciliation to net income 
ncm llc s founding members have also invested substantial capital to deploy  expand and upgrade the network within their theatres 
due to the network investments made by ncm llc s founding members in new and acquired theatres and the requirements in the esas to make future investments for equipment replacements and the scalable nature of our noc and other infrastructure  we do not expect to make major capital investments to grow our operations as our network of theatres expands 
the combination of our strong operating margins and our limited capital expenditures has allowed us to generate significant free cash flow defined as net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization and minus capital expenditures before distributions to ncm llc s founding members 
in the year ended december   our capital expenditures were million  of which million related to investments in network equipment in network affiliate theatres 
we believe our expected level of free cash flow generation should provide us with the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities  support our debt payments and make dividend payments to our stockholders 
experienced management team our management team has significant experience in advertising sales and marketing  digital media production and post production  theatre operations  digital network design and operations  and finance 
the majority of our senior management team was assembled during the formation of rcm  one of ncm llc s joint 
table of contents predecessor companies  in early and thus has worked together for several years building our business 
our senior management has many years of experience in their respective areas of expertise 
we believe that our senior management team should be able to effectively grow our business through continued operating improvement and expansion of our products and services 
dividend policy our dividend policy is described in item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividend policy 
our strategy our primary strategic initiatives are to increase advertising inventory utilization we intend to increase our market share of us advertising spending by expanding commercial relationships with our existing advertising clients and by growing our advertising client base 
we also intend to continue to improve our level of client service and expand the suite of marketing products sold to our clients 
while an increasing number of companies now make cinema advertising part of their media buying plan  there are still many large advertisers and product categories that do not yet include meaningful cinema advertising expenditures in their marketing budgets 
however  we have made great progress in expanding underpenetrated categories such as domestic auto  quick service restaurants  toys  retail  packaged goods  and financial services 
we believe that over time  as awareness of  and third party data on the effectiveness of cinema advertising grows  we expect to increase our revenue from these advertising categories 
since our formation  we increased the amount of regional advertising in our pre feature show from those of ncm llc s predecessor companies and have begun to more aggressively market and grow our local and regional advertising business 
for example  we employ senior sales positions to focus exclusively on larger regional clients such as car dealer associations  and quick service restaurant advertising co ops 
we have also utilized direct marketing campaigns to businesses within a specified radius of our network theatres  with very positive results 
these campaigns are often combined with theatre lobby promotions and advertising 
due to the relatively low percentage of local and regional advertising inventory sold today  we believe that a growth opportunity exists for further growth of this business segment 
increase our national cpm in  our national on screen advertising cpm was approximately times the average us primetime premium network television cpm as reported by media dynamics  inc we believe that this premium does not yet fully reflect the highly targeted nature of our impressions  higher recall rates  ability to provide measurable and informative demographic audience data to our clients and  most importantly  the inability to turn off or skip our advertising messages 
according to a world advertising research center study  cinema advertising cpms as a multiple of primetime network television cpms in more mature cinema advertising markets such as europe and australia are as much as times higher than television cpms in these territories 
therefore  we believe that there is an opportunity for continued cpm growth  especially as our inventory utilization increases  providing a more favorable supply demand dynamic 
expand our geographic coverage and reach we intend to continue to expand the reach and geographic coverage of our national digital network by connecting additional theatres to our network that ncm llc s founding members buy or build and through additional network affiliate agreements with other theatre circuits 
our strategy for attracting new network 
table of contents affiliates is to focus primarily on larger regional circuits in the larger metropolitan areas or in geographic areas where we do not currently have significant market coverage 
for example  in march  we signed a network affiliate agreement with goodrich quality theatres  a theatre operator with screens in michigan  indiana and illinois and in december we signed a network affiliate agreement with kerasotes theatres  the sixth largest us theatre operator  with approximately screens primarily in the upper mid and western us  including denver  minneapolis  chicago and indianapolis 
provide integrated marketing solutions to our clients we strive to differentiate ourselves amongst other media platforms  in particular broadcast and cable television 
advertising clients are increasingly seeking new ways to create direct relationships and touch points with customers  which our lobby advertising facilitates 
we allow clients to benefit from the brand exposure provided by the high impact of the big screen  while at the same time allowing theatre patrons an opportunity to actually experience the advertised product through sampling or displays in the lobbies 
we believe that our ability to provide both sight  sound and motion brand advertising and direct consumer touch points on an integrated basis in the same location is something that no other advertising medium can provide as effectively 
in  we will be testing two new in theatre marketing products  reatrix and brand experience 
if our testing of these two new products during early proves successful  we may begin to sell them late in on an individual basis or packaged with our in theatre products to further increase the effectiveness of our advertising products  providing incremental revenue at higher cpms 
increase market awareness of our cinemeetings business to expand our client base and increase revenue our cinemeetings business provides a new type of venue for corporate meetings and customer marketing of events that offers advantages over hotels and other traditional meeting venues 
unlike traditional hotel venues  we provide a single point of contact for national event booking and coordination and utilize digital distribution and projection technology 
in addition we also have the ability to bundle meetings with the screening of a film or fathom event  sometimes before the film opens to the general public  in a product known as meeting and a movie or fathom event 
we believe we can attract more clients to our network theatres and increase the revenue of our cinemeetings business by raising market awareness of the unique benefits of hosting meetings at our locations and through the increase in the number of theatres equipped to host live broadcasts completed in in an effort to expand the awareness and client base  we have employed several local and national marketing strategies to communicate the value proposition associated with our cinemeetings business 
marketing strategies include advertising in theatres within the firstlook pre show program and internet  implementing a direct mailing effort to fortune ceos and holding demand generation seminars for meeting planners in our network theatres 
our advertising sales group also has the opportunity to cross sell our cinemeetings products 
expand our live and pre recorded fathom events businesses we will continue to expand and improve the technical capabilities of our dcn and dbn 
today  virtually all of our digitally equipped screens have the capability to show pre recorded content 
during  we expanded our live broadcast capabilities to approximately locations from approximately in with over  seats in all top dmas 
we are upgrading our digital content system software so that it can handle distribution of large digital files associated with our digital programming events business 
while the opportunity to participate in distribution of content in a digital cinema environment is in its infancy today  we believe that our existing network and dcn and dbn technologies position us well to be able to expand these uses of our network theatres in the future as higher quality digital cinema systems are deployed 
we expect the improvements to projection technology and expansion of our network will improve the quality and broaden our capabilities to distribute various kinds of live and pre recorded meeting services and entertainment programming to a larger audience 
by expanding our live distribution capabilities  we expect to attract more non film live and 
table of contents pre recorded digital programming events  and  as a result  increase our event ticket revenue 
in addition to marketing and creating direct relationships with content owners  we will also look to form strategic alliances with promoters and distributors to gain access to high quality content 
for example  we have music content and cross marketing relationships with several live concert promotion companies 
we believe these partnerships and other content owner and producers should provide us with a consistent supply of music and other programming and an additional marketing channel for bands  promoters and content owners 
in addition  our agreement with the new york metropolitan opera to distribute live and pre recorded events nationally across our digital network has been well received by patrons across the country 
upgrade our advertising sales and inventory management systems we are currently upgrading and improving our advertising sales and inventory management systems 
we believe that these upgrades and improvements should enable us to respond more promptly to client requests for proposals  and should provide real time access to pricing and availability information that allows us to manage our inventory and cpm more efficiently  improve our management reporting and data analysis and provide the ability to manage a larger network as we add network affiliates and additional theatres acquired or built by our founding members 
expansion into other out of home networks in we invested million of cash in convertible preferred stock of ideacast  inc  a provider of advertising to currently over  fitness centers and health clubs throughout the united states  representing over million club attendees per year 
ideacast is an incubator of the health club network and other out of home advertising networks that ideacast is investigating  while our management team focuses on maximizing the growth opportunities within theatres 
we believe that out of home targeted advertising networks should continue to grow in importance as a percentage of advertising spending and that networks in virtually all retail environments may continue to be developed 
in addition to our initial investment we have an option at a specified valuation to acquire additional ideacast  inc common equity such that we will own of the company  thus we may have an opportunity to benefit from the future growth of this emerging business 
in addition  we believe that our distribution technology  sales force  other existing operating infrastructure and client relationships could create growth opportunities and expense and sales synergies across the ideacast networks 
launch branded entertainment web site in we plan to launch a branded entertainment web site as an extension of our firstlook pre show  and thereby broaden our advertising reach 
by developing and operating the site through our existing media production and technology group and selling the advertising through our existing sales forces and bundling the internet offerings with our existing in theatre advertising products  we believe that a new revenue stream could be developed with little investment 
we also believe that using our firstlook pre show and the ideacast networks to market the site should help drive traffic

ncm llc s founding members regal entertainment group regal operates the largest theatre circuit in the united states based on total number of screens

table of contents agreements with ncm llc s founding members exhibitor services agreements ncm llc has been the exclusive provider of in theatre advertising subject to certain pre existing contractual obligations for on screen advertising and other limited exceptions for the benefit of the founding members in the founding members theatres pursuant to agreements entered into with amc and regal in march and with cinemark in july in connection with the completion of the offering  we entered into amended and restated exhibitor services agreements with ncm llc s founding members 
key provisions of the new agreements include a term of years the term relating to cinemeetings and ncm fathom was initially five years with provisions for automatic renewal if certain financial performance conditions are met for an additional five years  a five year right of first refusal  which begins one year prior to the end of the term of the exhibitor services agreement  exclusive rights to provide advertising for the founding members theatres subject to the founding members rights to do the following on a limited basis promote activities associated with theatre operations on screen  on the lobby entertainment network and in the lobby including on additional video screens in theatre lobbies  and promote  on the lobby entertainment network and in theatre lobbies only  certain non exclusive cross marketing arrangements with third parties entered into by the founding members which are designed to promote the theatres and the movie going experience to increase attendance and revenue  payment of a monthly theatre access fee to the founding members  provides a right for the founding members to purchase up to seconds of on screen advertising time during the pre feature program at a specified rate intended to initially approximate a market rate in order to satisfy the founding members obligation to provide certain on screen advertising to their beverage concessionaires pursuant to their beverage concessionaire agreements  and primary responsibility of ncm llc to obtain  repair  maintain and replace the equipment not included in or on the theatre necessary to operate the dcn and primary responsibility of the founding members to fund the installation and replacement of the equipment in or on the theatre 
intellectual property rights we have been granted a perpetual  royalty free license from ncm llc s founding members to use certain proprietary software for the delivery of digital advertising and other content through our dcn to screens in certain defined territories 
we have made improvements to this software since the ipo date and we own those improvements  except for improvements that were developed jointly by us and the founding members 
we also have licensed intellectual property that is the subject of several us patent applications relating to scheduling in theatre advertising and digital content as well as matters relating to digital projector automation 
these licenses are governed by the pre reorganization license agreement 
we have applied for several us trademark registrations  including for national cinemedia and firstlook 
it is our practice to defend our trademarks and the associated goodwill from infringement by others 
we are aware of a number of other companies that use names and marks containing variations of the words contained in our existing trademarks 
there could be potential trademark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these names and marks 
if any of these infringement claims were to prove successful in preventing us from using our existing trademarks or preventing us from stopping a competitor from using our existing trademarks  our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted 

table of contents customers advertising customers 
our advertising business has a diverse customer base  consisting of national  regional and local advertisers 
we have business relationships with many national advertisers across a wide variety of industries  such as apparel accessories  automotive  confectionary  credit card  entertainment  personal care  retail  telecommunications and video games  as well as branches of the armed forces 
during the year ended december   we derived of our advertising revenue from our national clients  from founding member beverage agreements and from our relationships with thousands of regional and local advertisers across the country and with advertising agencies 
each of ncm llc s founding members have a relationship with a beverage concessionaire under which they are obligated to provide to seconds of on screen advertising time as part of their agreement to purchase syrup 
the exhibitor services agreements provide for the founding members purchase of this on screen advertising time at a negotiated rate intended to approximate a market rate in order to satisfy the founding members obligation to provide this advertising 
content partners 
we have multi year contractual relationships that provide entertainment content segments in the firstlook program and minimum annual advertising spending commitments with discovery  nbc  sony  tbs  and universal 
during we announced that a e  the history channel and warner brothers and disney  will be added as content partners 
these agreements require that the content partners will provide non commercial content segments that are entertaining  informative or educational in nature and will purchase a specified dollar amount of advertising at a specified cpm over a two year period with options to renew  exercisable at the content partner s option 
competition we compete in the over billion us advertising industry with many other forms of marketing media  including television  radio  print media  internet and outdoor display advertising 
while cinema advertising represents a small portion of the advertising industry today  we believe it is well positioned to capitalize on the shift of advertising spending away from traditional mass media to more targeted and measurable forms of media 
as the number of digital media platforms continues to increase  the ability to target narrow consumer demographics and to provide measurable third party marketing information has become increasingly important 
we believe that proliferation of digital technology enabling improved data collection may increase advertisers demand for digital advertising platforms and that cinema advertising is well positioned to address these trends 
we also compete with other providers of cinema advertising  which vary substantially in size  including screenvision and unique screen media owned by access integrated technologies  inc 
as one of the largest providers of cinema advertising in the united states  we believe that we are able to generate economies of scale  operating efficiencies and enhanced opportunities for our customers to access a national and regional audience and allowing us to better compete with television and other national advertising networks  giving us a competitive advantage over many other cinema advertising companies 
through the visual quality and impact of the big screen and surround sound  we are able to display high impact impressions to our audiences 
according to iag research  our cinema advertising generated recall rates ranging from one and a half to four times greater than advertising shown on television 
given the scale and technical capabilities of our digital network  we are able to tailor our advertising programs with more flexibility and to a broader audience than other cinema advertising companies  providing a more entertaining consumer experience and a more effective platform for advertisers 
our cinemeetings business competes with a number of venues including hotels  conference facilities  restaurants  arenas and other convention properties  as well as virtual meetings hosted on line and across private teleconferencing networks 
we believe that the combination of our ability to offer clients access to conveniently located theatres with big screens  stadium seating  high resolution digital projection and audio in multiple 
table of contents locations offers customers an attractive venue for meetings 
also  we offer a single point of contact and standardized pricing for our services  which is a competitive advantage when booking multi location events 
in addition  we offer clients the ability to combine a movie or fathom event with the meeting  which also differentiates us from other meeting venues 
our fathom business competes with other broadcast and cable networks  large scale public venues  including concert halls and other public meeting venues  and on demand television events 
we believe that the combination of our national theatre network  geographic distribution and high quality sight and sound presentation offers content owners and sponsors an effective venue for live and pre recorded events such as concerts and sporting events 
seasonality our revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients  and to a lesser extent  to the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry 
advertising expenditures tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters and are correlated to new product releases and marketing cycles 
theatrical attendance is generally highest during the summer and year end holiday season coinciding with the release of blockbuster films 
as a result  our first quarter typically has less revenue  ebitda and net income than the other quarters of a given year 
employees we employed people as of december   which includes employees engaged in overall management and general administration at our corporate headquarters in centennial  colorado  people employed in our regional sales and marketing offices and local advertising account executives and field maintenance technicians that work primarily from their homes 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
government regulation currently  we are not subject to regulations specific to the sale and distribution of cinema advertising that we need to comply with in our operations 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws that govern businesses generally such as wage and hour and worker compensation laws

table of contents item a 
risk factors ownership of the common stock of the company involves certain risks 
holders of the company s securities and prospective investors should consider carefully the following risks and other information in this document  including our pro forma and historical financial statements and related notes  in evaluating an investment in the company s common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  perhaps significantly 
risks related to our business and industry changes in the exhibitor services agreements with  or lack of support by  ncm llc s founding members could damage our revenue  growth and profitability the exhibitor services agreements with ncm llc s founding members are critical to our business 
the three exhibitor services agreements each have an initial term of years and provide us with a five year right of first refusal  which begins one year prior to the end of the term of the exhibitor services agreement 
the term of the exhibitor services agreements as they relate to cinemeetings and fathom  is approximately five years with provisions for automatic renewal of an additional five years  if certain financial performance conditions are met 
ncm llc s founding members theatres represent approximately of the screens and approximately of the attendance in our network as of december  if any one of the exhibitor services agreements were terminated  not renewed at its expiration or found to be unenforceable  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue  profitability and financial condition 
the exhibitor services agreements require the cooperation  investment and support of the founding members  the absence of which could adversely affect us 
pursuant to the exhibitor services agreements  ncm llc s founding members must make investments to replace digital network equipment within their theatres and equip newly constructed theatres with digital network equipment 
if the founding members do not have adequate financial resources or operational strength  and if they do not replace equipment or equip new theatres to maintain the level of operating functionality that we have today  or if such equipment becomes obsolete  we may have to make additional capital expenditures or our advertising  cinemeetings and digital programming events revenue and operating margins may decline 
if the founding members reject advertising or choose not to participate in certain cinemeetings or digital programming events under the terms of the exhibitor services agreements because they believe it would adversely affect their film attendance levels or the reputation of their company  our revenue from these businesses would be reduced 
the exhibitor services agreements allow the founding members to engage in activities that might compete with certain elements of our business  which could reduce our revenue and growth potential the exhibitor services agreements contain certain limited exceptions to our exclusive right to use the founding members theatres for our advertising business 
the founding members have the right to enter into strategic cross marketing relationships with third party  unaffiliated businesses for the purpose of generating increased attendance or revenue other than revenue from the sale of advertising and  subject to certain limits  can use one minute on the lobby entertainment network and certain types of lobby promotions  at no cost  for the purpose of promoting the products or services of those businesses while at the same time promoting the theatre circuit or the movie going experience 
subject to certain limits  they can also purchase an additional minute of advertising on the lobby entertainment network for these cross marketing promotions 
the use of lobby entertainment network or lobby promotions by ncm llc s founding members for these advertisements and programs could result in the founding members creating relationships with advertisers that could adversely affect our current lobby entertainment network and lobby promotions advertising revenue and profitability as well as the potential we have to grow that advertising revenue in the future 
the lobby entertainment network and lobby promotions represented of our total pro forma advertising revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents the founding members will not have the right to use their movie screens including the firstlook program or otherwise for promoting these cross marketing relationships  and thus we will have the exclusive rights to advertise on the movie screens  except for limited advertising related to theatre operations  and to package such on screen advertising with the lobby entertainment network advertising and lobby promotions 
the founding members also have the right to install a second network of video monitors in the theatre lobbies in excess of those required to be installed by the founding members for the lobby entertainment network 
this additional lobby video network  which we refer to as the founders lobby network  is to be used by the founding members to promote products or services related to operating the theatres  such as concessions and loyalty programs 
the presence of the founders lobby network within the lobby areas could reduce the effectiveness of our lobby entertainment network  thereby reducing our current lobby entertainment network advertising revenue and profitability and adversely affecting future revenue potential associated with that marketing platform 
if the non competition provisions of the exhibitor services agreements are deemed unenforceable  ncm llc s founding members could compete against us and our business could be adversely affected with certain limited exceptions  each of the exhibitor services agreements prohibits the applicable founding member from engaging in any of the business activities that we provide in the founding member s theatres under the exhibitor services agreement  and from owning interests in other entities that compete with us 
these provisions are intended to prevent the founding members from harming our business by providing cinema advertising services directly to their theatres or by entering into agreements with third party cinema advertising providers 
however  under state and federal law  a court may determine that a non competition covenant is unenforceable  in whole or in part  for reasons including  but not limited to  the court s determination that the covenant is not necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  unreasonably restrains the party against whom enforcement is sought  or is contrary to the public interest 
enforceability of a non competition covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible for us to predict whether  or to what extent  a court would enforce the non competition provisions contained in the exhibitor services agreements 
if a court were to determine that the non competition provisions are unenforceable  the founding members could compete directly against us or enter into an agreement with another cinema advertising provider that competes against us 
any inability to enforce the non competition provisions  in whole or in part could cause our revenue to decline 
if one of ncm llc s founding members declares bankruptcy  the exhibitor services agreement with that founding member may be rejected  renegotiated or deemed unenforceable or our network could be adversely affected by the disposition of theatres each of ncm llc s founding members currently has a significant amount of indebtedness which is below investment grade 
in and  several major motion picture exhibition companies filed for bankruptcy 
for example  each of united artists  edwards theatres  regal cinemas  general cinemas and loews cineplex filed for bankruptcy during or the industry wide construction of larger  more expensive megaplexes featuring stadium seating in the late s that rendered existing  smaller  sloped floor theatres under long term leases obsolete and unprofitable  were significant contributing factors to these bankruptcies 
if a bankruptcy case were commenced by or against a founding member  it is possible that all or part of the exhibitor services agreement with that founding member could be rejected by a trustee in the bankruptcy case pursuant to section or section of the united states bankruptcy code  or by the founding member  and thus not be 
table of contents enforceable 
alternatively  the founding member could seek to renegotiate the exhibitor services agreement in a manner less favorable to us than the existing agreement 
in addition  the founding member could seek to sell or otherwise dispose of theatres  which might result in the removal of those theatres from our network if the acquirer did not agree to continue to allow us to sell advertising in the acquired theaters 
because we sell advertising based on the number of theatre patrons that will view the advertisement  a reduction in the number of theatres in our network could reduce our advertising revenue 
the markets for advertising  meeting management and digital programming content are competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully the market for advertising is intensely competitive 
cinema advertising is a small component of the overall us advertising market and thus we must compete with established  larger and better known national and local media platforms and newly emerging media platforms such as the internet 
we compete for advertising directly with all media platforms  including radio and television broadcasting  cable and satellite television services  various local print media  billboards and internet portals and search engines 
we also compete directly with other cinema advertising companies 
we expect these competitors to devote significant financial and operating resources to maintaining and growing their respective positions in the cinema advertising segment 
we also expect existing competitors and new entrants to the cinema advertising business to constantly revise and improve their business models in light of challenges from us or competing media platforms 
if we cannot respond effectively to advances by our competitors  our business may be adversely affected 
our cinemeetings business facilitates live and pre recorded events in theatre auditoriums 
these events are typically scheduled from monday through thursday during off peak hours while theatre attendance for movies is traditionally low 
this business competes for customers with a number of venues including hotels  conference facilities  restaurants  arenas and other convention properties  as well as virtual meetings hosted on line or over private teleconferencing networks 
accordingly  our ability to increase sales in our cinemeetings business is contingent on our ability to attract new customers and compete effectively against other well established and well capitalized venues 
our fathom business focuses on the distribution of entertainment programming products 
it includes live and pre recorded concerts and music events  concert and dvd product releases  theatrical premieres  broadway plays  as well as live sports and other special events 
this business competes for music  sports and other entertainment programming with other national networks  some of which offer greater geographic reach and larger audiences 
accordingly  our ability to source a consistent flow of programming is contingent on our ability to develop and sustain relationships with content owners 
because we rely heavily on ncm llc s founding members ability to attract customers  any reduction in attendance at founding member theatres could decrease our revenue our business is affected by the success of ncm llc s founding members  who operate in a highly competitive industry 
from the late s through  the number of movie screens and the level of theatre attendance in the united states increased substantially  as movie theatres began to offer new amenities such as stadium seating  improved projection quality and superior sound systems 
while box office attendance increased in compared to and in as compared to  it declined in each of  and if theatre attendance declines in the future  one or more of ncm llc s founding members may face financial difficulties and could be forced to sell or close theatres or reduce the number of screens it builds or upgrades 
attendance may also decline if the founding members fail to maintain their theatres and provide amenities that consumers prefer  or if they cannot compete successfully on pricing 
ncm llc s founding members also may not successfully compete for licenses to exhibit quality films and are not assured a consistent supply of motion pictures since they do not have long term arrangements with major film distributors 
any of these circumstances could reduce our revenue because our revenue depends on the number of theatre patrons who view our advertising and pre feature show 

table of contents significant declines in theatre attendance could reduce the attractiveness of cinema advertising the value of our advertising business could be adversely affected by a long term multi year decline in theatre attendance or even the perception by media buyers that our network attendance and geographic coverage were expected to decline significantly over the next several years 
factors that could reduce attendance at our network theatres include the following the shortening of the release window between the release of major motion pictures in the theatres and release to alternative methods for delivering movies to consumers  such as dvd or hd dvd  cable television  downloads via the internet  video discs and cassettes  video on demand  satellite and pay per view services  any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general that reduces the demand for motion pictures or adversely affects the motion picture production industry  and the success of first run motion pictures  which depends upon the production and marketing efforts of the major studios and the attractiveness of the movies to patrons 
the loss of any major content partner or advertising customer could significantly reduce our revenue we derive a significant portion of our revenue from our contracts with our content partners and ncm llc s founding members agreements to purchase on screen advertising for their beverage concessionaires 
ncm llc s or its predecessor company s relationships with certain content partners date back as far as december none of these companies individually accounted for over of our pro forma revenue during the year ended december  however  the agreements with the content partners and beverage advertising with the founding members in aggregate accounted for approximately of our pro forma revenue during the year ended december  because we derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from a relatively small number of large companies  the loss of any one or more of them as a customer could decrease our revenue and adversely affect our current and future operating results 
we generate our revenue almost entirely from advertising  and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could have a serious adverse effect on our business we generated approximately of our pro forma revenue in the year ended december  from advertising sales 
a substantial portion of our advertising inventory is covered by contracts with terms of approximately one month 
advertisers will not continue to do business with us if they believe our advertising medium is ineffective or overly expensive 
in addition  large advertisers generally have set advertising budgets  most of which are focused on traditional media platforms 
reductions in the size of advertisers budgets due to local  regional or national economic trends or other factors could result in lower spending on cinema advertising in general or our advertising business in particular 
if we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers  they may reduce their advertising purchases or stop placing advertisements with us  which would negatively affect our revenue and ability to generate new business from advertising clients 
if we do not maintain our technological advantage  our business could fail to grow and revenue and operating margins could decline failure to successfully or cost effectively implement upgrades to our software systems to maintain our technological competitiveness could limit our ability to increase our revenue and more effectively leverage our digital platform 
any failure by us to upgrade our technology to remain current with technological changes  including digital cinema  that may be adopted by other providers of cinema advertising or other advertising platforms could hurt our ability to compete with those companies 
under the terms of the exhibitor services agreements with ncm llc s founding members  we may request that ncm llc s founding members upgrade the equipment or software installed in their theatres 
we must negotiate with ncm llc s founding members as to the terms of such upgrade  including cost sharing terms  if any 
if we are not able to come to an agreement on 
table of contents an upgrade request  we may elect to pay for the upgrades requested which could result in our incurring significant capital expenditures  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  the failure or delay in implementation of such upgrades or problems with the integration of our systems and software with the digital cinema systems  if such integration is pursued  could slow or prevent the growth of our business 
our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth  and we may be unable to effectively manage or continue our growth we have experienced  and continue to experience  rapid growth in our headcount and operations  which has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management and operational infrastructure 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  the quality of our services could suffer  which could negatively affect our brand  our relationships with our advertising clients and digital content suppliers and our operating results 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continue to improve our digital content system distribution software and our internal management systems  including our advertising inventory optimization  management and reporting systems 
these systems enhancements and improvements will require allocation of valuable financial and management resources 
if the improvements are not implemented successfully in a timely manner or at all  our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues 
our preliminary plans for developing additional revenue opportunities may not be implemented  may require substantial expenditures and may not be achieved in addition to our strategy to grow our advertising  cinemeetings and fathom businesses  we are also considering other potential opportunities for revenue growth  which we describe in business our strategy expansion into other out of home networks 
for example  in we made a million investment in preferred stock of ideacast inc  a provider of advertising to fitness centers and health clubs throughout the united states 
we may decide to continue to expand our network technology and sales capabilities outside of theatres 
some of our plans are at an early stage  such as our internet initiative  and we may or may not actually proceed with any of them 
these new marketing platforms and others that we choose to invest in may not be profitable  despite our having made substantial investments 
because we have a limited operating history  it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects ncm llc s predecessor company  rcm  began operations in february ncm llc was formed on march   as a joint venture that combined the operations of subsidiaries of amc and regal 
cinemark joined as a founding member on july  our founding members have made several acquisitions including century and loews and we have entered into new network affiliate agreements with kerasotes and goodrich and may enter into more in the future 
as a result  we have a limited operating history from which you can compare corresponding periods and evaluate our business 
we may encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by newly formed companies in rapidly evolving businesses 
if we are unsuccessful in executing our business strategy  we may be unable to increase our revenue and expand our client base  operate  support  expand  develop and improve our software and other systems  continue to produce high operating income margins  and respond to technological changes

certain of our historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect the costs that we would have incurred had we operated as an independent stand alone public entity 
these costs include higher corporate overhead  interest expense and income taxes 
our historical financial information includes the consolidated financial statements of rcm and ncn  the joint predecessor companies of ncm llc  for periods prior to march and does not include any information related to cinemark 
although historical financial information on amc s theatre advertising subsidiary  ncn  is presented herein  there is no historical financial information on the combined operations of both ncn and rcm prior to the formation of ncm llc 
additionally  the historical financial statements of rcm and ncn include payments to their parent companies at different rates than those in effect after the formation of ncm llc  which rates changed again after completion of the financing transaction and reorganization 
because cinemark had a pre existing contract with another cinema advertising provider  ncm llc began selling advertising for cinemark s screens on an exclusive basis beginning on january  subject to the run out of certain pre existing contractual obligations for on screen advertising through april  
in addition  our historical financial information does not include any information related to theatres operated by loews  which amc acquired on january   and which will become a part of our theatre network beginning on june   or century  which cinemark acquired on october   and which became a part of our theatre network on an exclusive basis  subject to limited exceptions  on the closing date 
the historical results of operations of ncm llc  rcm and ncn have been significantly impacted by related party transactions that we have entered into  as further discussed in the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this document  and the future operating results of ncm inc will also be significantly impacted by related party transactions entered into in connection with our initial public offering 
as a result  this information may not be representative of our future financial performance 
in preparing the pro forma financial information in this document  we have made adjustments to the historical financial information of ncm llc and its predecessor companies based upon currently available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect  on a pro forma basis  the impact of the transactions contemplated by the reorganization  the financing transaction and our initial public offering 
some of these adjustments include  among other items  the terms of the exhibitor services agreements with ncm llc s founding members  adjustments to income tax provisions to account for ncm llc s status as a limited liability company and our status as a taxable entity  and our acquisition of common membership units of ncm llc 
however  the pro forma financial information does not include adjustments for the addition of the cinemark  loews or century screens

we depend upon our senior management and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot retain them our success depends upon the retention of our experienced senior management with specialized industry and technical knowledge and or industry relationships 
we might not be able to find qualified replacements for our senior management if their services were no longer available to us  accordingly  the loss of critical members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy and our relationships with advertisers and content partners 
we do not have key man life insurance covering any of our employees 

table of contents our technology may infringe on rights owned by others which may interfere with our ability to provide services we may discover that the technology we use infringes patent  copyright  or other intellectual property rights owned by others 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our competitors will not claim rights in patents  copyrights  or other intellectual property that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to provide our services either in the united states or in international markets 
further  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable  which could increase the volatility of our stock price typically  our revenue is lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year as advertising clients scale back their advertising budgets following the year end holiday season  and our revenue is highest during the summer and the holiday season when theatre attendance is normally highest 
however  a weak advertising market  the poor performance of films released in a given quarter or a disruption in the release schedule of films could affect results for the entire fiscal year and significantly affect quarter to quarter results 
because our results vary widely from quarter to quarter and may be unpredictable  our financial results for one quarter cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter and may not be indicative of our financial performance in subsequent quarters 
these variations in our financial results could contribute to volatility in our stock price 
risks related to our corporate structure we are a holding company with no operations of our own  and will depend on distributions and payments under the management services agreement from ncm llc to meet our ongoing obligations and to pay cash dividends on our common stock we are a holding company with no operations of our own and have no independent ability to generate revenue 
consequently  our ability to obtain operating funds depends upon distributions from ncm llc 
the distribution of cash flows and other transfers of funds by ncm llc to us are subject to statutory and contractual restrictions based upon ncm llc s financial performance  including ncm llc s compliance with the covenants in its senior secured credit facility and the ncm llc operating agreement 
the ncm llc senior secured credit facility limits ncm llc s ability to distribute cash to its members  including us  based upon certain leverage tests  with exceptions for  among other things  payment of our income taxes and a management fee to ncm inc pursuant to the terms of the management services agreement 
we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders or pay other expenses outside the ordinary course of business if ncm llc fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to distribute cash to us 
pursuant to the management services agreement between us and ncm llc  ncm llc makes payments to us to fund our day to day operating expenses  such as payroll 
however  if ncm llc cannot make the payments pursuant to the management services agreement  we may be unable to cover these expenses 
as a member of ncm llc  we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of ncm llc 
we have structured the ncm llc senior secured credit facility to allow ncm llc to distribute cash to its members including us and the founding members in amounts sufficient to cover their tax liabilities and management fees  if any 
to the extent we need funds to pay such taxes or for any other purpose  and ncm llc is unable to provide such funds because of limitations in the ncm llc senior secured credit facility or other restrictions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 

table of contents ncm llc s substantial debt obligations could impair our financial condition or prevent us from achieving our business goals ncm llc is party to a million term loan that is part of a senior secured credit facility 
the agreements governing ncm llc s debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit ncm llc s ability to take specified actions and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that ncm llc must meet 
because ncm llc is our only operating subsidiary  complying with these restrictions may prevent ncm llc from taking actions that we believe would help us to grow our business 
for example  ncm llc may be unable to make acquisitions  investments or capital expenditures as a result of such covenants 
moreover  if ncm llc violates those restrictive covenants or fails to meet the minimum financial requirements  it would be in default  which could  in turn  result in defaults under other obligations of ncm llc or us 
any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity 
the senior secured credit facility also includes an million revolving credit facility 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility fluctuates based on our working capital needs 
if ncm llc is unable to meet its debt service obligations  it or we could be forced to restructure or refinance the obligations  seek additional equity financing or sell assets 
we may be unable to restructure or refinance these obligations  obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
in addition  ncm llc s indebtedness could have other negative consequences for us  including without limitation limiting ncm llc s ability to obtain financing in the future  requiring much of ncm llc s cash flow to be dedicated to interest obligations and making it unavailable for other purposes  limiting ncm llc s liquidity and operational flexibility in changing economic  business and competitive conditions which could require ncm llc to consider deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  selling assets  restructuring existing debt or deferring acquisitions or other strategic opportunities  and making ncm llc more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates  a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions 
ncm llc s founding members or their affiliates may have interests that differ from those of our public stockholders and they may be able to influence our affairs so long as a founding member beneficially owns at least of ncm llc s issued and outstanding common membership units  approval of at least of the directors then in office provided that if the board has less than ten directors  then the approval of at least of the directors then in office will be required before we may take any of the following actions or we  in our capacity as manager of ncm llc  may authorize ncm llc to take any of the following actions assign  transfer  sell or pledge all or a portion of the membership units of ncm llc beneficially owned by ncm inc  acquire  dispose  lease or license assets with an aggregate value exceeding of the fair market value of the business of ncm llc operating as a going concern  merge  reorganize  recapitalize  reclassify  consolidate  dissolve  liquidate or enter into a similar transaction  incur any funded indebtedness or repay  before due  any funded indebtedness with a fixed term in an aggregate amount in excess of million per year

pursuant to a director designation agreement  so long as a founding member owns at least of ncm llc s issued and outstanding common membership units  such founding member will have the right to designate a total of two nominees to our ten member board of directors who will be voted upon by our stockholders 
if  at any time  any founding member owns less than of ncm llc s then issued and outstanding common membership units  then such founding member shall cease to have any rights of designation 
if any director designee to our board designated by ncm llc s founding members is not appointed to our board  nominated by us or elected by our stockholders  as applicable  then each of the founding members so long as such founding member continues to own of ncm llc s issued and outstanding common membership units will be entitled to approve specified actions of ncm llc 
for purposes of calculating the ownership threshold for the supermajority director approval rights and director designation agreement provisions discussed above  shares of our common stock held by a founding member and received upon redemption of ncm llc common membership units will be counted toward the threshold 
common membership units issued to ncm inc in connection with the redemption of common membership units by a founding member will be excluded  so long as such founding member continues to hold the common stock acquired through such redemption or such founding member has disposed of such shares of common stock to another founding member 
shares of our common stock otherwise acquired by the founding members will also be excluded  unless such shares of common stock were transferred by one founding member to another and were originally received by the transferring founding member upon redemption of ncm llc common membership units 
under these circumstances  our corporate governance documents will allow ncm llc s founding members and their affiliates to exercise a greater degree of influence in the operation of our business and that of ncm llc and the management of our affairs and those of ncm llc than is typically available to stockholders of a publicly traded company 
even if ncm llc s founding members or their affiliates own a minority economic interest in ncm llc  they may be able to continue exerting such degree of influence over us and ncm llc 
different interests among ncm llc s founding members or between ncm llc s founding members and us could prevent us from achieving our business goals for the foreseeable future  we expect that our board of directors will include directors and executive officers of ncm llc s founding members and other directors who may have commercial or other relationships with ncm llc s founding members 
ncm llc s founding members compete with each other in the operation of 
table of contents their respective businesses and could have individual business interests that may conflict with those of the other founding members 
their differing interests could make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among ncm llc s founding members 
in addition  the structural relationship we have with ncm llc s founding members could create conflicts of interest among the founding members  or between the founding members and us  in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships 
there is not any formal dispute resolution procedure in place to resolve conflicts between us and a founding member or between founding members 
we may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and a founding member and  even if we do  the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party 
the corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable the founding members to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us our certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both ncm llc s founding members and us 
it provides that if a corporate opportunity is offered to us  ncm llc or one or more of the officers  directors or stockholders both direct and indirect of ncm inc or a member of ncm llc that relates to the provision of services to motion picture theatres  use of theatres for any purpose  sale of advertising and promotional services in and around theatres and any other business related to the motion picture theatre business except services as provided in the exhibitor services agreements as from time to time amended and except as may be offered to one of our officers in his capacity as an officer  no such person shall be liable to us or any of our stockholders or any affiliate thereof for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity  directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity  or information regarding such business opportunity  to us 
this provision applies even if the business opportunity is one that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and the ncm llc operating agreement expressly provide that ncm llc s founding members may have other business interests and may engage in any other businesses not specifically prohibited by the terms of the certificate of incorporation and exhibitor services agreements 
if the parent companies of the founding members develop new media platforms they could compete for advertising dollars with our services 
further  we may also compete with the founding members or their affiliates in the area of employee recruiting and retention 
these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by the founding members to themselves or their other affiliates or we lose key personnel to them 
the agreements between us and ncm llc s founding members were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and may contain different terms than comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties the exhibitor services agreements and the other contractual agreements that we have with ncm llc s founding members were negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship in which representatives of ncm llc s founding members and their affiliates comprised our entire board of directors 
as a result  the financial provisions and the other terms of these agreements  such as covenants  contractual obligations on our part and on the part of ncm llc s founding members  and termination and default provisions may be less favorable to us than terms that we might have obtained in negotiations with unaffiliated third parties in similar circumstances 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover protections that may discourage or prevent strategic transactions  including a takeover of our company  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  the ncm llc operating agreement  provisions of the delaware general corporation law  or dgcl  could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us  even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws establish supermajority approval requirements by our directors before our board may take certain actions  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares  making a takeover more difficult and expensive  establish a classified board of directors  allow removal of directors only for cause  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and provide that the founding members will be able to exercise a greater degree of influence over the operations of ncm llc  which may discourage other nominations to our board of directors  if any director nominee designated by the founding members is not elected by our stockholders 
these restrictions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital  which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position 
these restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of us or ncm llc 
any future issuance of membership units by ncm llc and subsequent redemption of such units for common stock could dilute the voting power of our existing common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock the common unit adjustment agreement and the exhibitor services agreements provide that we will issue common membership units of ncm llc to account for changes in the number of theatre screens ncm llc s founding members operate 
historically  each of the founding members has increased the number of screens it operates 
if this trend continues  ncm llc may issue additional common membership units to the founding members to reflect their increase in net screen count 
each common membership unit may be redeemed in exchange for  at our option  shares of our common stock on a one for one basis or a cash payment equal to the market price of one share of our common stock 
if a significant number of common membership units were issued to ncm llc s founding members  the founding members elected to redeem such units  and we elected to issue common stock rather than cash upon redemption  the voting power of our common stockholders could be diluted 
other than the maximum number of authorized shares of common stock in our certificate of incorporation  there is no limit on the number of shares of our common stock that we may issue upon redemption of a founding member s common membership units in ncm llc 
our future issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of our common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock the future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock  either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class  or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock 

table of contents the future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights  liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive 
for example  investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock 
if we or ncm llc s founding members are determined to be an investment company  we would become subject to burdensome regulatory requirements and our business activities could be restricted we do not believe that we are an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended 
as sole manager of ncm llc  we control ncm llc  and our interest in ncm llc is not an investment security as that term is used in the investment company act 
if we were to stop participating in the management of ncm llc  our interest in ncm llc could be deemed an investment security for purposes of the investment company act 
generally  a company is an investment company if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding of the value of its total assets excluding us government securities and cash items 
our sole material asset is our equity interest in ncm llc 
a determination that such asset was an investment security could result in our being considered an investment company under the investment company act 
as a result  we would become subject to registration and other burdensome requirements of the investment company act 
in addition  the requirements of the investment company act could restrict our business activities  including our ability to issue securities 
we and ncm llc intend to conduct our operations so that we are not deemed an investment company under the investment company act 
however  if anything were to occur that would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company  we would become subject to restrictions imposed by the investment company act 
these restrictions  including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates  could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operations 
we also rely on representations of ncm llc s founding members that they are not investment companies under the investment company act 
if any founding member were deemed to be an investment company  the restrictions placed upon that founding member might inhibit its ability to fulfill its obligations under its exhibitor services agreement or restrict ncm llc s ability to borrow funds 
our tax receivable agreement with the founding members is expected to reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us and will increase our potential exposure to the financial condition of the founding members we expect that our initial public offering and related transactions will have the effect of reducing the amounts ncm inc would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in its proportionate share of tax basis in ncm llc s tangible and intangible assets 
we have agreed in our tax receivable agreement with the founding members to pay to the founding members of the amount by which ncm inc s tax payments to various tax authorities are reduced 
after paying these reduced amounts to tax authorities  if it is determined as a result of an income tax audit or examination that any amount of ncm inc s claimed tax benefits should not have been available  ncm inc may be required to pay additional taxes and possibly penalties and interest to one or more tax authorities 
if this were to occur  and if one or more of the founding members was insolvent or bankrupt or otherwise unable to make payment under its indemnification obligation under the tax receivable agreement  then ncm inc s financial condition could be materially impaired 

table of contents the substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale could cause the market price for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future we cannot predict the effect  if any  that market sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that those sales will occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult 
if we are unable to sell equity securities at times and prices that we deem appropriate  we may be unable to fund growth 
the  shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering are freely tradable  except for  shares acquired by our affiliates 
in addition  the founding members may receive up to  shares of common stock  which initially will be unregistered  upon redemption of their outstanding common membership units of ncm llc 
these shares of common stock will constitute restricted securities under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act 
provided the holders comply with the holding periods and other conditions prescribed in rule under the securities act  all but  of these unregistered shares of common stock cease to be restricted securities and become freely tradable

our stock price may be volatile before our initial public offering in february  there was no public market for our common stock  and an active trading market for our common stock may not continue 
the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our stock price may fluctuate or decline due to a variety of factors  including actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  changes in the market valuations of other companies  announcements relating to actions of other media companies  strategic relationships  acquisitions or industry consolidation  terrorist acts or wars  and general economic  market and political conditions not related to our business

table of contents notes to the selected historical financial and operating data ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures used by management to measure operating performance 
ebitda represents net income loss before net interest expense  income tax benefit provision  and depreciation and amortization expense 
adjusted ebitda excludes from ebitda severance plan costs  non cash unit based costs and deferred stock compensation 
adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by total revenue 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the loews payments 
the loews payments received are added to adjusted ebitda to determine our compliance with financial covenants under our new senior secured credit facility 
amc makes loews payments to ncm llc pursuant to the loews screen integration agreement  which was million for the post ipo period 
we have included a discussion of ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and because they are the basis for an important financial covenant that is contained in our senior secured credit facility 
we believe ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on our operating performance and so highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  financial measures 
we also believe that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties frequently use ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to evaluate and value companies  many of which present ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin when reporting their results 
also  because of the significant changes in our operating results that resulted from the acquisition of an interest in ncm llc by ncm  inc  the changes in the exhibitor services agreements and the financing transaction  we disclose pro forma ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in this document 
see the unaudited pro forma financial information contained elsewhere in this document 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap 
as discussed above  we believe that the presentation of ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are appropriate measures of our financial performance 
however  when evaluating our results  you should not consider ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in isolation of  or as a substitute for  measures of our financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap  such as net income loss 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have material limitations as performance measures because they exclude items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations 
because other companies may calculate ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin differently than we do  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

this discussion includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  as amended 
in some cases  you can identify these forward looking statements by the specific words  including but not limited to may  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of those words and other comparable words 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain factors as more fully discussed under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this document 
our historical financial data discussed below prior to the completion of the company s ipo reflects the historical results of operations and financial position of ncm llc and its joint predecessors  rcm and ncn 
accordingly  historical financial data does not give effect to the reorganization and the ncm llc senior secured credit facility completed as part of the ncm  inc ipo 
see business corporate history  business reorganization  financial condition and liquidity financings and the unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in this document 
overview ncm llc was formed on march   by amc and regal as a joint venture that combined the cinema advertising and meetings and events operations of a wholly owned subsidiary of regal and the cinema advertising operations of a wholly owned subsidiary of amc entertainment  inc amce 
on july   cinemark  through a wholly owned subsidiary  joined ncm llc as a founding member 
because cinemark had a pre existing contract with another cinema advertising provider  ncm llc began selling advertising for cinemark s screens on an exclusive basis beginning on january   subject to the run out of certain pre existing contractual obligations for on screen advertising through april  as a result  we began to record revenue from the sale of advertising for cinemark s screens on january  on a non exclusive basis until april  cinemark acquired century theatres in october and ncm llc began to sell advertising on an exclusive basis in those century theatres in november the results of operations data for the period december  through february  the pre ipo period give effect to allocations of revenues and expenses made using relative percentages of founding member attendance or days in each period  specific events or facts and other methods management considered to be a reasonable reflection of the results for such period 
the results of operations data for the period february  through december  the post ipo period were derived from the audited consolidated financial results of ncm  inc the historical financial data of ncm llc prior to the ipo may not be indicative of the company s post ipo performance nor will such data reflect what its financial position and results of operations would have been had it operated as an independent publicly traded company during the pre ipo periods presented 
our revenue is principally derived from the sale of advertising and  to a lesser extent  from our cinemeetings business and fathom events business 
we have long term exhibitor services agreements with ncm llc s founding members and multi year agreements with several other unrelated theatre operators  whom we refer to as network affiliates 
the exhibitor services agreements with the founding members and network affiliate agreements grant us exclusive rights  subject to limited exceptions  to sell advertising and meeting services and distribute entertainment programming in those theatres 
our advertising  cinemeetings and fathom events are distributed primarily to theatres that are digitally equipped with our proprietary dcn technology 
in excess of of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is included in our digital network 

table of contents our national on screen and lobby entertainment network advertising contracts with clients typically specify the number of theatre attendees  or impressions  to be delivered for a four or five week advertising campaign and the unit price per thousand impressions  or cpm  for a second advertising unit 
our regional and local on screen advertising contracts with clients typically specify the number of screens  duration of time typically one to several weeks and the unit price typically a cost per screen per week for an advertising campaign 
typically there are a minimum of national second advertising units and a minimum of local second units available in any advertising campaign within the firstlook pre feature program 
the number of national or local units can be expanded to a certain extent depending on market demand 
programming on our lobby entertainment network consists of an approximately minute loop of content segments and advertising 
our lobby promotions contracts are based on a standardized rate card for each product that typically specifies the number of impressions to be delivered 
our cinemeetings revenue is derived from the rental of theatre auditoriums  and the provision of catering services and network and audio visual services that are sold as part of our meeting and event services 
our fathom revenue is derived from the sale of tickets to the general public for music  sporting and other entertainment events or a series of events 
cinemeetings and fathom events are typically held on the weekdays when theatre attendance for films is lower 
our advertising rates are generally either based on contracts with our content partners and other advertisers  or driven by the demand in the advertising marketplace  including television and other segments of national  regional and local advertising 
our national on screen cpms vary by the time of year and the placement within our pre feature program 
our founding members and certain of our network affiliates report to us each theatre s attendance by film and film rating category on a weekly or monthly basis 
our network affiliate attendance represented approximately of our total attendance for the post ipo period and we estimate it will be in excess of for the number of people in the auditorium at the time an advertisement is presented is based on the exhibitor s attendance reports 
we calculate the number of impressions delivered against advertising contracts by multiplying the attendance data received from the exhibitors by the number of patrons in their seat at a given time prior to the advertised show time 
the percentage is based on independent third party research 
if  during any contract period we under deliver the number of contracted impressions  we may be obligated to either provide make good advertising units in a subsequent period and defer the recognition of the related revenue or refund a pro rata portion of the contract amount in cash to the client 
historically  in the majority of cases  clients have agreed to make good rather than to request a refund of cash 
the expenses associated with our business historically have included i selling and marketing expenses  ii network operations and maintenance costs  iii advertising and event costs  iv administrative costs and v theatre access fees and circuit share expenses to our founding members 
our selling and marketing expenses include the base salaries and commissions of our advertising sales staff and expenses associated with marketing  public relations and research departments 
network operations and maintenance costs relate to the personnel and other costs associated with our content production and post production activities  costs associated with operating our network operations center  satellite bandwidth costs and maintenance of the network software and hardware 
advertising and event costs relate primarily to production and fulfillment of non digital advertising and payments based on a sharing of revenue with our network affiliates and the direct costs associated with cinemeetings and fathom 
our administrative costs primarily consist of salaries and bonuses for our administrative staff  professional fees  insurance  and occupancy costs 
circuit share payments are the payments made to ncm llc s founding members for the right to provide our services in their theatres using our digital content network dcn and prior to the offering represented substantially all of our earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
in the post ipo period  under the amended and restated esas  theatre access fees were payable to the founding members  in lieu of circuit share expense  comprised of a payment per theatre attendee and a payment per digital screen  both of which escalate over time  but which are expected to result in significantly lower payments as a percentage of our revenue than have been required historically 

table of contents our operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully below in factors affecting comparability of results of operations and as also described in risk factors pre feature show content 
we have sought to make our firstlook pre show both entertaining for theatre audiences and an effective advertising platform for our clients 
if the theatre audiences or advertisers do not respond as we anticipate to our pre feature show format or content  our advertising revenue could be adversely affected 
trends in advertising 
as advertisers continue to shift spending to non traditional  targeted media platforms from traditional media such as television  newspapers and billboards  our advertising business could benefit from this trend 
theatre attendance 
theatre attendance depends to a significant degree on the quality of the motion pictures distributed by the movie studios to the film exhibitors as well as the development of other distribution platforms 
although theatre attendance declined from to and then moderately increased in and  during this time  cinema advertising revenue significantly increased as a result of better visibility of the medium and the use of digital technology  which enhanced the reach and overall value proposition of cinema advertising 
however  as cinema advertising matures  this trend may not continue 
addition of theatres 
as theatres are added to our digital in theatre network either as ncm llc s founding members construct or acquire theatres  such as in the case of the century acquisition  or as we add new network affiliates  due to the scalable nature of our business  we expect our revenue to increase with minimal additional capital or operating expenditures 
growth of our meetings and digital programming businesses 
our ability to grow our meetings and digital programming businesses depends on our success in growing our customers awareness of these services through effective marketing 
management focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators for us to manage our business and to determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets  and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate 
management confers monthly to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business 
we focus on many operating metrics including changes in ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  as discussed below  as some of our primary measurement metrics 
in addition  we pay particular attention to our monthly advertising performance measurements  including advertising inventory utilization  pricing cpm  advertising revenue per founding member attendee and the number of cinemeetings and fathom event locations and revenue per location 
finally  we monitor our operating cash flow and revolving credit facility availability to ensure that debt and declared and future dividend obligations can be met

separate periods have been presented because there were significant changes at the time of the ipo due to the esa modifications and related expenses thereunder  and significant changes to revenue arrangements and contracts with the founding members 
the results of operations data for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  were derived from the historical financial statements and accounting records of ncm llc and from the financial statements and accounting records of ncn for the period december  through march  and rcm for the three months ended march  the balance sheet of ncm llc at december  reflects the carryover basis of the founding members in the assets contributed by ncn and rcm 
we have a week or week fiscal year ending on the first thursday after december fiscal years  and contained weeks 
throughout this document  we refer to our fiscal years as set forth below fiscal year ended reference in this document december  period december  through february  pre ipo period december  period february  through december  post ipo period december  december  factors affecting comparability of results of operations rcm provided advertising services to the regal theatre circuit and a network affiliate during the first quarter of fiscal ncn provided advertising services to the amc theatre circuits and various network affiliates during its first quarter of fiscal ncm llc was formed on march   by amc and regal as a joint venture that combined the cinema advertising and meetings and events operations of regal s subsidiary  rcm  and the cinema advertising operations of amc s subsidiary  ncn 
on july   cinemark joined ncm llc as a founding member 
upon becoming a member of ncm llc  each founding member entered into an exhibitor services agreement with ncm llc  which remained in effect until the founding members entered into amended and restated esas upon the completion of the ipo 
at ncm llc s formation  each of amc and regal retained their pre existing advertising contracts and ncm llc administered those contracts on behalf of those founding members for an administrative fee equal to a percentage of total revenue through december  and through february  
over time as these legacy advertising contracts were fulfilled and ncm llc entered into new contracts directly with advertisers  the administrative fees declined and our advertising revenue increased 
the total underlying legacy contract value was approximately equal to our administrative fees during that period divided by the administrative fee percentage 
in addition  because cinemark had a pre existing contract with another cinema advertising provider  ncm llc began selling advertising for cinemark s screens on an exclusive basis beginning on january   subject to the run out of certain pre existing contractual obligations for on screen advertising through april  by may  all of cinemark s digital screens were connected to our dcn 
on october   cinemark completed the acquisition of the century theatre circuit  and the century screens were added to our network on an exclusive basis in november the timing of the addition of the cinemark and century theatres to our network affects the comparability of results from the periods as they were not included in the results for the full year ended december  on january   amc acquired the loews theatre circuit 
the loews screen integration agreement  effective as of january  and amended and restated as of february   between ncm llc and amc  commits amc to cause the theatres it acquired from loews to participate in the exhibitor services 
table of contents agreements beginning on june  these us based loews screens will become part of our national advertising network on an exclusive basis beginning on june   following the expiration of loews pre existing contract with another cinema advertising provider 
the loews theatres will be subject to the following limitations i during the period beginning on june  through november   the run out of on screen advertising and entertainment content and ii during the period beginning on december  through february   the right of the prior advertising provider to up to one minute of advertising during the pre feature show  in each case  for pre existing contractual obligations that exist on may  in accordance with the loews screen integration agreement  amc pays us amounts based on an agreed upon calculation to reflect the net amount of cash that approximates what ncm llc would have generated if we were able to sell on screen advertising in the loews theatre chain on an exclusive basis 
these loews payments are made on a quarterly basis in arrears through may  in accordance with certain run out provisions 
for the post ipo period  the loews payment is million and the amount included in the due to from founding members at december  is million 
the loews payment is recorded directly to ncm llc s members equity account 
we believe that one of the most meaningful metrics to ascertain the growth of our advertising revenue among all historical periods presented is the total amount of our advertising revenue  excluding advertising revenue associated with the founding member beverage concessionaire agreements  plus the legacy contract value  which we refer to as advertising contract value 
the trend of total advertising contract value  divided by the total number of founding member attendees  which we refer to as total advertising contract value per founding member attendee is also a measure that we use to track our revenue performance over time 
we believe that these metrics are helpful to analyze advertising revenue performance across our reporting periods  while providing a measure of revenue which is independent of the number of screens in our network and corresponding attendance for which advertising services are being provided 
under the amended and restated esas that became effective on february   ncm llc total advertising revenue has increased significantly due to the payments from the founding members for the display of up to seconds of on screen advertising under their beverage concessionaire agreements at an agreed upon rate 
in addition  as discussed above  the conversion from circuit share to theatre access fee structure will reduce the payments made to the founding members as a percentage of advertising revenue 
the increases in the size of our network  as well as differences in the structure of circuit share expense and theatre access fee and the circuit beverage revenue limit the comparability of revenues and operating expenses for all reporting periods 
therefore  certain components of operating expenses  including selling and marketing  administrative  and depreciation expense  are analyzed on the basis of cost per founding member attendee 
we also analyze on the basis of operating expense as a percentage of revenues  as this metric may provide meaningful trend analysis 
the following table presents total advertising contract value and operating expenses per founding member attendee for the periods presented  which will be discussed further below 
period february  through december  period december  through february  year ended december  period march  through december  predecessor ncn period december  through march  predecessor rcm three months ended march  total advertising contract value in millions total advertising contract value per founding member attendee total operating expense per founding member attendee total operating expense as a percentage of revenues 
table of contents results of operations post ipo period and the pre ipo period and the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue of the company for the post ipo period was million  while total revenue for the pre ipo period was million  as compared to million during the twelve months ended december  the increase in the aggregate periods over the period was primarily the result of payments from the founding member beverage agreements  increase in national advertising inventory utilization and cpm  an increase in local and regional advertising sales  the conversion or assignment of certain legacy contracts and increasing meetings and events revenue 
the aggregate national advertising revenue for the periods increase of related primarily to an increase in national advertising inventory utilization to from  a increase in cpms  an increase in non inventory on screen and lobby revenue and a increase in founding member attendance 
local and regional advertising revenue increased by primarily due to an increase in screens and time sold 
the meeting and events revenue increase of related to an increase in fathom revenue due to an increase in event count of approximately  primarily for the met  offset by decrease in revenue for cinemeetings due to a decrease in event count 
total advertising contract value per founding member attendee for the company for the post ipo period was  while the total advertising contract value per founding member attendee was for the pre ipo period and during the year ended december  the approximate increase in the advertising contract value per founding member for the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus the year ended december  was primarily the result of increased utilization through an increase in expenditures from certain existing clients and the expansion of our advertising client base 
the increase was also due to an increase in sales of non inventory on screen and lobby revenue  such as the sale of branded content segments  cell phone trailer segments and lobby promotional items 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the post ipo period were million  million during the pre ipo period and million for the year ended december  the increase of the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus total operating expenses for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the increase in sales commissions and event costs associated with the increase in revenue discussed above and increased expenses due to additional staffing and infrastructure required to support the increase in the number of advertising contracts  expansion of the network and public company compliance costs 
non cash costs associated with our equity incentive plan also contributed to the increase in administrative expenses 
share based compensation expense for the post ipo period was million  while the expense was million for the pre ipo period and million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in share based compensation expense is primarily due to the plan being in place for the entire post ipo and pre ipo periods  while it was only in place for nine months of the twelve months ended december  as the options were originally issued in the second quarter of and additional grants made at the time of the ipo 
see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for additional details 
total operating expenses per founding member attendee for the company for the post ipo period was  for the pre ipo period and during the year ended december  the increase in total operating expenses per founding member for the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus the year ended december  was primarily the result of costs associated with increased revenue and related expenses associated with the lower margin meetings and events businesses  increased administrative costs associated with our public company compliance  offset by the fixed nature of many of our operating expenses associated with our advertising business 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the post ipo period was  for the pre ipo period was and for the year ended december  was 
the decrease in the post ipo period percentage is primarily the result of higher advertising revenue levels discussed above and the scalable nature of several components of our operating expenses 

table of contents circuit share expense theatre access fee 
theatre access fees of the company for the post ipo period were million  while circuit share expense was million during the pre ipo period and million during year ended december  the decrease for the post ipo period versus the ncm llc pre ipo period and the year ended december  was primarily the result of the amended and restated esas that became effective upon the completion of the ipo as discussed above 
total theatre access fees as a percentage of revenue of the company for the post ipo period were  while the total circuit share expense as a percentage of revenue was for the pre ipo period and during the year ended december  the decrease in the theatre access fee as a percentage of revenue for the post ipo period was the result of the change in the structure of the theatre access fee as compared to the circuit share payments prior to the amendment and restatement of the esas  as previously discussed 
net income loss 
net income generated by the company for the post ipo period was million  while for the pre ipo period there was a net loss of million and there was a net loss of million during the year ended december  the increase in the profitability of the company for the post ipo period versus the periods prior to the ipo was due to the increase in revenue and decrease in payments to the founding members discussed above  partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the new credit facilities and the income taxes and expenses associated with the tax receivable agreement and minority interest expense associated with the new corporate structure 
the comparability of the net income of the periods presented is limited due to the differing lengths of the periods  size of our network and changes in the corporate structure and capitalization as discussed above 
years ended december  and december  for purposes of this analysis  the year ended december  includes revenue  total advertising contract value  operating expenses  circuit share expense and net income loss of our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn for the quarter ended march   and the results of ncm llc for the nine months ended december  revenue 
total revenue generated by our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  was million and million during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and total revenue generated by ncm llc from april  through december  was million 
total revenue generated by ncm llc for the year ended december  was million 
the increase versus the combined three month joint predecessor revenue and nine month ncm llc revenue was the result of a combination of higher national advertising cpms  which increased by between ncm llc s period ended december  and year ended december   and an expansion of advertising client base and our network  including the increase in average founding member screens of  or  primarily due to the addition of cinemark  as well as its conversion of certain legacy contract revenue between ncm llc s nine month period ended december  and year ended december  to ncm llc contracts thereby increasing our revenue  and a increase in cinemeetings revenue due to an increase in event count of and due to the increase in revenue per event 
total advertising contract value of ncm llc s joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  was million and million during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and total advertising contract value of ncm llc from april  through december  was million 
total advertising contract value of ncm llc for the year ended december  was million 
this increase versus the combined three month joint predecessor revenue and nine month ncm llc revenue was primarily the result of the expansion of our advertising client base and network and increase in advertising cpms  as discussed above 
total advertising contract value per founding member attendee of our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  was and during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and total advertising contract value per founding member attendee of ncm llc from april  through december  was 
total advertising contract value per founding member attendee of ncm llc for the year ended december  was 
this decrease versus the 
table of contents combined three month joint predecessor revenue and nine month ncm llc revenue was the result of the impact of restrictions on our ability to sell national advertising on cinemark s screens between january  and april  on an exclusive basis  coupled with slight reductions in local advertising inventory utilization as the existing cinemark clients were transitioned to our firstlook format  the addition of century attendees in november  the usual delay associated with absorbing these additional attendees into our sales process and the termination of our largest network affiliate agreement in terms of advertising revenue that was unprofitable in november operating expenses 
total operating expenses generated by our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  were million and million during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and total operating expenses of ncm llc from april  through december  were million 
total operating expenses of ncm llc for the year ended december  were million 
this increase versus the combined three month joint predecessor revenue and nine month ncm llc revenue was primarily due to increased cost levels due to the addition of cinemark screens to our network  increased affiliate and commission expenses related to higher revenue  and increased administrative expenses due to additional staffing and infrastructure required to support the growth of ncm llc  as well as non cash costs associated with our unit option plan 
direct comparison  however  is not necessarily reflective of future trends between the periods because certain expenses which were incurred by predecessor companies on a separate basis would have been duplicative during their comparative periods  including costs for administrative services including human resources  legal services  accounting services  and other managerial expenses for positions which would have been eliminated when the joint venture was formed  such as sales staff executives 
upon formation of ncm llc  these duplicative services were eliminated 
total operating expense per founding member attendee of our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  was and during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and total operating expense per founding member attendee of ncm llc from april  through december  was 
total operating expense per founding member attendee of ncm llc for the year ended december  was 
this decrease versus the combined three month joint predecessor revenue and nine month ncm llc revenue was due to a combination of the addition of cinemark as a founding member and the absorption of those additional screens into our sales process  as well as the elimination of certain of the duplicative expenses incurred by the joint predecessors discussed above 
circuit share expense 
circuit share expense generated by our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  was million and million during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and circuit share expense of ncm llc from april  through december  was million 
total circuit share expense of ncm llc for the year ended december  was million 
the increase in circuit share expense was primarily due to the increase in levels of revenue during the period  as discussed above  and to a lesser extent  due to the change in the structure of the circuit share agreement which increased the circuit share rate from of advertising revenue in to in as noted above  upon completion of the offering  the circuit share expense currently paid to the founding members was converted to a theatre access fee  which is expected to result in significantly lower expense 
net income loss 
net income loss generated by our joint predecessors  rcm and ncn  respectively  was million and million during their quarter ended march  prior to the formation of ncm llc and the net income loss of ncm llc from april  through december  was million 
total net loss of ncm llc for year ended december  was million 
the higher loss for was due to the off setting factors of increased revenue and circuit share expense discussed above 
also  the comparability of the net income of the two periods is limited due to the addition of the cinemark theatres to our network in 
table of contents financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to the balance of million as of december  in addition  we had access to an undrawn line of credit of million for a total liquidity position of million as of december  the increase in our liquidity position from december  was in part a result of positive cash from operating and financing activities offset by higher levels of investing activities 
a substantial amount of cash has been set aside for future income tax and tax sharing payments and payments related to dividends that have been declared 
cash flows in millions 
post ipo period ended dec 
 pre ipo period ended february  year ended dec 
 nine months ended dec 
 net cash from operating activities net cash from investing activities net cash from financing activities operating activities 
the increase in funds provided by operating activities for the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in revenues in the periods and lower payments to the founding members related to the transition from a circuit share to a theatre access fee structure after the ipo 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
investing activities 
the increase in funds used for investing activities for the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus the year ended december  was primarily due to million of cash invested in auction rate securities  million of cash invested in convertible preferred stock of ideacast  inc and investments in our network software and in corporate management systems and purchases of equipment necessary to service the expansion of our network in network affiliate theatres 
financing activities 
the increase in funds generated from financing activities for the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus the year ended december  was primarily due to net proceeds related to the ipo and net borrowings on our senior secured credit facility and distributions paid to the founding members offset by dividend payments 
cash provided by financing activities for ncm llc during the nine months ended december  was primarily related to the sale of membership units to cinemark 
the cash balance at the end of the historical periods has been typically low  as circuit share payments are made to the founding members out of excess cash 
we also expect to have relatively low cash balances in future periods due to minority interest payments to our founding members and quarterly dividends to our common shareholders we expect to pay pursuant to our dividend policy 
sources of capital and capital requirements 
ncm  inc s primary source of liquidity and capital resources are distributions from ncm llc generated by the operating  investing and financing activities of the operating subsidiary  ncm llc  and availability of up to million under ncm llc s senior secured revolving credit facility entered into in february management believes that future funds generated from ncm llc s operations and distributions to ncm  inc and available borrowing capacity of up to million under ncm llc s revolving credit facility should be sufficient to fund quarterly dividends  ncm llc s debt service requirements  working capital requirements 
table of contents and capital expenditure and other investing requirements  through the next months 
we made a draw of million on the new credit facility at the closing of the ipo to repay amounts outstanding under ncm llc s then existing revolving credit facility and made a draw of million on march  to repay remaining amounts owed to the founding members under the prior exhibitor services agreements that  due to timing differences  were funded by the collection by us of related receivables 
the amount outstanding as of december  on our revolving credit facility was million 
cash flows generated by ncm llc s distributions to ncm  inc can be impacted by the seasonality experienced in advertising revenues at ncm llc and the impact to associated collections of accounts receivable 
our short and long term cash requirements consist of minimum annual payments under our operating leases for our headquarters and regional offices and capital expenditures and other investments that we make from time to time 
minimum annual operating lease requirements associated with our headquarters and regional offices are included in our direct operating expenses  which have historically been satisfied by cash generated from operations 
for fiscal  we are committed to million of annual operating lease payments 
in addition  ncm llc is required pursuant to terms of the operating agreement effective as of february  to distribute its available cash  as defined in the operating agreement  to its members  including the company 
the available cash distribution to the members of ncm llc for the quarter ended december  was approximately million  of which million was the company s portion 
the total available cash distribution for the post ipo period was approximately million  of which million was the company s portion 
the company will use cash received from the available cash distributions to fund income taxes and current and future dividends as declared by the board of directors  including a dividend declared of per share approximately million which will be paid on march  capital expenditures 
capital expenditures of ncm llc have typically been related to equipment required for our network operations center and content production and post production facilities  digital content system and back office capitalized software upgrades developed primarily by our programmers  office leasehold improvements  desktop equipment for use by our employees  and in certain cases  the costs necessary to digitize all or a portion of a network affiliate s theatres when they are added to our network 
capital expenditures for the post ipo period were million including million associated with network affiliate additions  while capital expenditures were million  million and million for the pre ipo period  the year ended december  and the nine months ended december   respectively 
the capital expenditures have typically been satisfied through cash flow from operations 
all capital expenditures related to the dcn within ncm llc s founding members theatres have been made by the founding members under the exhibitor services agreements 
we expect they will continue to be made by the founding members in accordance with the amended and restated esas 
we expect to make approximately million to million of capital expenditures in fiscal including approximately million associated with network affiliates  primarily for ordinary course maintenance of our digital content system  upgrades to our distribution software and our internal management systems  including our advertising inventory optimization  management and reporting systems  our interactive initiative and network equipment in network affiliate theatres 
we expect these upgrades and improvements to our management reporting systems  which are intended to provide additional advertising scheduling and placement flexibility for our clients  should enhance our operating efficiencies  including allowing us to better manage our advertising inventory  and prepare us for continued growth 
these capital expenditures may be increased in connection with expenditures made in network affiliate theatre proposals  should additional ones be added to our network 
we expect that these additional expenditures  if any  would be funded in part by additional cash flows associated with those new network affiliates 
the commitments associated with our operating lease requirements are included in contractual and other obligations below 

table of contents financings demand note 
on march   ncm llc signed an amended and restated demand promissory note  or the demand note  with the founding members  under which ncm llc could borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
borrowings under the demand note were funded by the founding members pro rata to their ownership of units 
interest paid to the founding members during the three months ended june  was less than million 
on march   the demand note was cancelled and replaced by the credit facility discussed below 
prior ncm llc credit facility 
on march   ncm llc entered into a million secured revolving credit facility  with a million letter of credit facility  with a group of lenders 
on february   the balance under this facility was paid off and cancelled and replaced by the new senior secured credit facility discussed below 
new senior secured credit facility 
on february   concurrently with the closing of the ipo of ncm  inc  ncm llc entered into a senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders 
the facility consists of a six year million revolving credit facility and an eight year  million term loan facility 
the net proceeds of the term loan were used  together with million of proceeds from the offering  to redeem all the preferred membership units of ncm llc for an aggregate price of million 
the term loan will be due on the eighth anniversary of the funding 
the revolving credit facility portion is available  subject to certain conditions  for general corporate purposes of the company in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the credit agreement  and a portion is available for letters of credit 
the outstanding balance of the term loan facility at december  was million 
the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at december  was million 
the obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of ncm llc 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bear interest  at the option of the company  at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus either a variable base rate or a eurodollar rate 
the applicable margin for the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility is with respect to base rate loans and with respect to eurodollar loans 
as of december   the effective rate on the term loan was the interest rate swap hedged million of the million term loan at a fixed interest rate of while the unhedged portion was at an interest rate of and the weighted average interest rate on the revolver was 
commencing with the third fiscal quarter in fiscal year  the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility will be determined quarterly and will be subject to adjustment based upon a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio for ncm llc and its subsidiaries defined in the ncm llc credit agreement as the ratio of secured funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  over adjusted ebitda  as defined 
upon the occurrence of any payment default  certain amounts under the senior secured credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the rate then in effect with respect to such borrowings  plus per annum 
the senior secured credit facility also contains a number of covenants and financing ratio requirements  with which  at december   the company was in compliance 
upon occurrence of an event of default  among other remedies available to the lenders  all outstanding loans may be accelerated and or the lenders commitments may be terminated 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies of ncm llc are described in note of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of ncm llc 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables  which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor specific factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
account receivable balances are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance 
a provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
revenue recognition 
ncm llc considers estimates regarding make good provisions in advertising revenue to be a critical accounting policy that requires complicated mathematical calculations used to determine the shortfall of advertising impressions delivered 
advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which theatre attendees impressions are provided 
advertising revenue is recorded net of make good provisions to account for delivered attendance that is less than the amount contracted 
the amount contracted is based on an estimate of attendees at the date the contract is signed 
when actual attendance  based on amounts reported by the founding members  is less than contracted  a make good provision is required 
share based compensation 
the company s equity incentive plan is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of sfas no 
r  and the determination of fair value of options for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments 
we utilize the black scholes option price model to estimate the fair value of our options 
this model requires that the company make estimates of various factors used 
the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options expected life of options we are a newly public company and applied the sec simplified method the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the options during and in the absence of reliable historical data of our company or from a group of peers to estimate our expected life 
we expect to continue to use this method until we have a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate was determined by using the applicable treasury rates as of the grant dates  commensurate with the expected terms of the options 
expected volatility ncm closed its ipo on february  since the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the contractual terms of our options  we believe historical volatility may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
as a result  we estimated expected volatility based on comparable companies and industry indexes for historic stock price volatility 
until such time as we have sufficient historical information to derive an implied volatility we expect to continue to use this method as long as we believe such companies are comparable to us 
dividend yield the estimated dividend yield was determined using management s expectations based on estimated cash flow characteristics and expected long term dividend policy after the ipo 
fair value estimation 
ncm llc considers estimates regarding fair value of our investment in preferred stock of ideacast  inc to be a critical accounting policy that requires significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company s preferred stock investment in ideacast  inc  which is accounted for as an available for sale debt security  requires significant management judgment because the securities are not publicly traded and as a result there is no readily determinable fair value 
the company based its estimated fair value on factors including  but not limited to product development activity  whether there have been significant changes  positive or negative  in the prospects for ideacast s business  and the overall health of ideacast and its industry 
in addition  should the fair value of ideacast decline below our cost  management judgment will be required to assess whether the investment should be considered other than temporarily impaired 
the company prepared a discounted cash flows model for the valuation analysis using assumptions for the number of installed clubs  capital expenditures per club installation  advertising inventory  utilization rate and cpm as significant inputs

the terms of the new senior secured credit facility required us to hedge the cash flow variability of interest for at least of the term loan 
in march of  ncm llc entered into fixed interest rate swap arrangements hedging million of the million senior secured credit facility at a fixed interest rate of 
in addition  we have a variable rate revolving credit agreement 
debt service requirements under this agreement depend on the amounts borrowed and the level of the based interest rate  in addition to a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
see further discussion of the new senior secured credit facility at financial condition and liquidity financings 
the amended and restated esas entered into at the completion of our ipo require payments based on a combination of founding member attendance and the number of digital screens of each founding member 
the former factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theatre attendance varies while the latter factor will be more predictable but will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens and others are added or removed through acquisition  divestiture or closure activities of the founding members 
the payments made to founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated esas 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the amended and restated esas as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 

table of contents seasonality the levels of revenue  operating income  net income  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients  and to a lesser extent  to the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry 
advertising expenditures tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters and are correlated to new product releases and marketing cycles 
theatrical attendance is generally highest during the summer and year end holiday season coinciding with the release of blockbuster films 
as a result  we typically have less revenue  operating income  net income  ebitda and adjusted ebitda and our operating margins are lower in the first quarter than the other quarters of a given year 
importantly  the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next or any future quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would affect interest costs relating to the variable portion of our senior secured debt facility which is not covered under the hedging agreement 
at december   there was an aggregate of million of variable rate debt outstanding on the term portion of our facility that was not covered by interest rate swaps  and million of variable rate debt outstanding on the revolver portion of our facility 
based on the interest rate levels in effect on the unhedged variable rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest expense by approximately million for an annual period  net of the effect on interest rate swaps
