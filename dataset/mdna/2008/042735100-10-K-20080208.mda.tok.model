the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

the company elected to adopt  for periods prior to january   the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which used a fair value based method of accounting for sbp awards

see note for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
the costs and obligations of the company s defined benefit pension plan are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the two critical assumptions used  which impact the net periodic pension cost income and the benefit obligation  are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate represents the market rate for a high quality corporate bond  and the expected return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  historical trends  and expected returns on plan assets 
these key assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts 
the company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative and qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a weighted average multiple of earnings before interest and taxes from comparable companies 
in determining the fair value  the company makes certain judgments  including the identification of reporting units and the selection of comparable companies 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of products sold or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports shipping and handling costs  primarily related to outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company  as a large  global organization  faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact the company s financial results in the future 
the company s primary exposure relates to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency utilized to purchase the product sold in europe  the asia pacific region  canada  and latin america 
the company s policy is to hedge substantially all such currency exposures for which natural hedges do not exist 
natural hedges exist when purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and  therefore  no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward  option  or swap contracts collectively  the foreign exchange contracts 
in many regions in asia  for example  sales and purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  resulting in a natural hedge 
natural hedges exist in most countries in which the company operates  although the percentage of natural offsets  as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts  will vary from country to country 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties  which the company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is estimated using market quotes 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amounts  which are nominal  approximated fair value at december  and the translation of the financial statements of the non united states operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in consolidated sales and operating income was impacted by the translation of the company s international financial statements into us dollars 
this resulted in increased sales of million and increased operating income of million for  compared with the year earlier period  based on sales at the average rate for sales and operating income would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  if average foreign exchange rates had declined by against the us dollar in this amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical foreign exchange rate on the sales and operating income of the company s international operations 
in may  the company entered into a cross currency swap  with a maturity date of july  for approximately million or million the cross currency swap to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated net assets 
the cross currency swap is designated as a net investment hedge and effectively converts the interest expense on million of long term debt from us dollars to euros 
as the notional amount of the cross currency swap is expected to equal a comparable amount of hedged net assets  no material ineffectiveness is expected 
the cross currency swap had a negative fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in october  the company entered into a cross currency swap  with a maturity date of october  for approximately million or million the cross currency swap to hedge a portion of its net investment in euro denominated net assets 
the cross currency swap is designated as a net investment hedge and effectively converts the interest expense on million of long term debt from us dollars to euros 
as the notional amount of the cross currency swap is expected to equal a comparable amount of hedged net assets  no material ineffectiveness is expected 
the cross currency swap had a negative fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense  in part  is sensitive to the general level of interest rates in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
the company historically has managed its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate debt in its total debt portfolio 
additionally  the company utilizes interest rate swaps in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   approximately of the company s debt was subject to fixed rates  and of its debt was subject to floating rates 
a one percentage point change in average interest rates would not materially impact interest expense  net of interest income  in this was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate on the company s average floating rate on investments and outstanding 
table of contents debt 
this analysis does not consider the effect of the level of overall economic activity that could exist 
in the event of a change in the level of economic activity  which may adversely impact interest rates  the company could likely take actions to further mitigate any potential negative exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that might be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap the swap with a notional amount of million 
the swap modifies the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the variable rate at december  on a portion of its million term loan to a fixed rate of per annum through december the swap is classified as a cash flow hedge and had a negative fair value of 
million at december  in june  the company entered into a series of interest rate swaps the swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps modify the company s interest rate exposure by effectively converting the fixed senior notes to a floating rate  based on the six month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of and at december  and  respectively  and a portion of the fixed senior notes to a floating rate  also based on the six month us dollar libor plus a spread an effective rate of and at december  and  respectively  through their maturities 
the swaps are classified as fair value hedges and had a fair value of million and a negative fair value of million at december  and  respectively
