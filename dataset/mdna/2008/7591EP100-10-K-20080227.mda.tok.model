item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk introduction general the following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding regions financial corporation s regions or the company financial position and results of operations 
the emphasis of this discussion will be on the years  and  in addition  financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate 
certain amounts in prior year presentations have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  except as otherwise noted 
regions profitability  like that of many other financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income regions receives on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense regions pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities 
non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  securities brokerage  investment banking and trust activities  mortgage servicing and secondary marketing  insurance activities and other customer services which regions provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including income taxes 
economic conditions  competition  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most financial institutions  including regions 
lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment  consumer income  consumer spending and savings  capital market activities  and competition among financial institutions  as well as customer preferences  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions market areas 
regions business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services  delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations 
regions delivers this business with the personal attention and feel of a community bank and with the service and product offerings of a large regional bank 
acquisitions the acquisitions of banks and other financial services companies have historically contributed significantly to regions growth 
the acquisitions of other financial services companies have also allowed regions to better diversify its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services to its customers 
regions  from time to time  evaluates potential bank and non bank acquisition candidates 
during  regions acquired two financial services entities 
on january   regions insurance group  inc  a subsidiary of regions financial corporation  acquired certain assets of miles finch  inc  a multi line insurance agency headquartered in kokomo  indiana  with annual revenues of approximately million  for a purchase price of million 
on june   morgan keegan co  inc  a subsidiary of regions financial corporation  acquired shattuck hammond partners llc shattuck hammond  an investment banking and financial advisory firm headquartered in new york  new york  with annual revenues of approximately million  for a purchase price of million 
subsequent to december   on january   regions insurance group  inc acquired certain assets of barksdale bonding and insurance  inc  a multi line insurance agency headquartered in jackson  mississippi  with annual revenues of approximately million  for a purchase price of million 
on november   regions merged with amsouth bancorporation amsouth  headquartered in birmingham  alabama 
in the transaction  amsouth was merged with and into regions financial corporation 
the combination with amsouth added approximately billion of assets including excess purchase price  billion of loans  net of unearned income  and billion of deposits including divested deposits 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase of percent of the voting interests of amsouth by regions and  accordingly  financial results for periods prior to november  have not been restated 
amsouth s assets and liabilities were recorded at estimated fair values and its results of operations were included in regions results beginning in november note business combinations and assets held for sale provides a summary of amsouth s balance sheet 
comparisons with prior periods are significantly impacted by the merger with amsouth 
the company completed the operational integration of amsouth into regions during as part of the integration process  regions converted its mortgage  brokerage  trust  and payroll and benefits platforms  as well as its entire network of  branches to a common operating platform 
concurrent with the branch conversions  branches in close proximity to one another were consolidated into the remaining branch system 
the primary goal of the integration process was to ensure a smooth  seamless transition for regions customers while selecting the best products  systems and other back office functions from both organizations 
by nearly all accounts  branch conversions were well executed  having minimal negative impact to regions customer base 
also related to the merger  during the first quarter of regions successfully divested branches  which is discussed later in the dispositions section of this report 
regions estimates that it will incur slightly above million in one time merger related costs to bring the two companies together 
regions recorded million of such costs in excess purchase price during this amount was subsequently adjusted down by million in the majority of merger costs flowed directly through the income statement 
these included million and million in merger expenses during and  respectively 
the remaining costs are anticipated to be recognized as merger expenses during the first two quarters of anticipated cost savings are an important driver of any merger transaction 
regions estimates that at least million of ongoing annual cost savings will result from the merger and expects to achieve the full cost savings run rate by mid since the merger date  million of the total cost savings have been achieved  with million of that amount having been achieved during these savings were primarily recognized in areas such as personnel  occupancy and equipment  operations and technology  and corporate functions 
on july   regions merged with union planters corporation union planters  which was headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the combination was accounted for as a purchase of union planters by regions and accordingly  prior period financial statements have not been restated  except certain share and per share amounts related to the exchange of regions common stock 
dispositions during the first quarter of  through sales to three separate buyers  regions completed the divestiture of former amsouth branches having approximately billion in deposits and billion in loans 
these divestitures were required in markets where the merger may have affected competition 
the million premium received from the divestitures was recorded as a reduction to excess purchase price 
on march   regions sold its wholly owned non conforming mortgage origination subsidiary  equifirst corporation equifirst for a sales price of approximately million 
the business related to equifirst has been accounted for as discontinued operations and the results are presented separately on the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
the sales price is subject to final resolution of closing date values of net assets sold  which is not yet completed 
see note discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for further details

excluding merger related charges  annual earnings per share from continuing operations decreased percent to in from in primary drivers of net income from continuing operations  other than a full year impact of the amsouth merger  were regions solid fee income  record performance at morgan keegan  and overall expense control  including merger cost savings 
however  certain valuation related and other charges during the fourth quarter of  as well as a higher provision for loan losses resulting from the rapid deterioration of credit quality  contributed to lower earnings per share for see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for additional details

net interest income was billion in compared to billion in the increase was driven by a larger balance sheet for the full year  resulting from the merger with amsouth in late however  negatively impacting net interest income was a lower net interest margin  which declined to percent during compared to percent in primary drivers of the reduced net interest margin include the impact of integrating amsouth s balance sheet into regions balance sheet  a decline in low cost deposit balances  and the negative effects of a lower tax equivalent adjustment resulting from the first quarter adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the adoption of fin net charge offs totaled million  or percent of average loans  in compared to percent in the increased loss rate resulted from deteriorating economic conditions during  especially as related to the housing sector 
non performing assets increased million between december  and december  to million  primarily due to weakness in the company s residential homebuilder portfolio  which began experiencing significant pressure toward the end of this pressure was due to a combination of declining residential demand and resulting price and collateral value declines in certain of the company s markets  particularly areas of florida and atlanta  georgia 
also affecting non performing assets to a lesser extent was the impact of combining the credit policies and procedures of legacy regions and amsouth to form a single credit culture 
regions sold approximately million of non performing loans during the second half of  which somewhat offset the net increase in non performing assets 
the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses from continuing operations increased to million compared to million in two primary factors led to the increase 
most notably  included just two months of provision for loan losses added to the portfolio as a result of the november merger with amsouth  while the provision recorded in reflected the results of the newly merged regions for the full year 
additionally  the provision rose due to an increase in management s estimate of inherent losses in its residential homebuilder portfolio  as well as generally weaker conditions in the broader economy 
as a result of the general economic environment and the deteriorating credit conditions described above  which accelerated late in  regions increased its allowance for credit losses through a loan loss provision from continuing operations of million and a provision for unfunded commitments of million  million and million of which  respectively  were expensed in the fourth quarter 
these provisions drove the allowance for credit losses up to percent of total loans  net of unearned income  at december   as compared to percent at december  non interest income from continuing operations excluding securities gains losses totaled billion or percent of total revenue fully taxable equivalent basis in compared to billion or percent in  and continued to reflect regions diversified revenue stream 
non interest income increased due to the full year inclusion of former amsouth operations in  compared with approximately two months of combined results in service charges on deposit accounts increased in due to increases in the volume of non sufficient funds nsf fees collected and higher interchange income  as the number of customer accounts rose through the addition of the amsouth customer base 
a change in the pricing structure of nsf service charges also contributed to the year over year increase 
in addition to amsouth related increases  brokerage and investment banking revenues mainly from morgan keegan s business lines were also strong during the year  largely attributable to higher private client activity and solid investment banking transaction flow 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage income  including residential mortgage servicing fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans  during non interest expense from continuing operations totaled billion in compared to billion in  impacted by merger charges totaling million and million  respectively 
merger costs consist mainly of personnel expenses  the cost of integrating amsouth systems with those of regions and the consolidation of branches 
excluding these merger related expenses  non interest expense increased billion or percent in compared to  with the largest driver being the full year inclusion of the amsouth expense base in see table non interest expense including non gaap reconciliation for further details 
as an offset to merger costs  non interest expenses were positively affected by the realization of merger cost savings  which continued to build throughout these savings exceeded original estimates and totaled million for the year 
cost savings are expected to increase through the second quarter of  at which time a total annual savings run rate in excess of million should be achieved 
merger charges and an overall higher level of expense related to the larger size of post merger regions notwithstanding  non interest expenses were impacted most significantly by higher salaries and employee benefit costs  driven by merit increases  and an increase in core deposit intangible amortization expense resulting from the amsouth acquisition 
in addition  regions commission driven revenues such as brokerage  investment banking and mortgage did  and will continue to  impact non interest expense levels in direct correlation to revenue trends 
the balance sheet decreased slightly in size in on a period end basis  due largely to the impact of merger related loan and deposit divestitures and a smaller investment securities portfolio 
in addition  demand for residential related real estate lending softened during the year  primarily a result of the challenging economic backdrop and industry wide tightening of credit 
total loans were relatively unchanged comparing december  to the prior year end  while deposit divestitures totaling billion contributed to the year over year decline in total deposits 
beyond the divestitures  changes in customers investment preferences fueled by changing interest rates and modestly improving equity markets early in the year further pressured deposit balances  which  excluding divested deposits  declined four percent overall in versus year end table gaap to non gaap reconciliation presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures excluding discontinued operations and merger charges non gaap 
merger charges are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
regions believes the exclusion of merger charges in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures  including earnings per share from continuing operations  excluding merger charges and return on average tangible equity  excluding discontinued operations and merger charges  provides a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business  because management does not consider merger charges to be relevant to ongoing operating results 
management and the board of directors utilize these non gaap financial measures for the following purposes preparation of regions operating budgets calculation of performance based annual incentive bonuses for certain executives calculation of performance based multi year incentive bonuses for certain executives monthly financial performance reporting  including segment reporting monthly close out flash reporting of consolidated results management only presentations to investors of company performance regions believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management and the board of directors 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
to mitigate these limitations  regions has policies in place to address expenses that qualify as merger charges and procedures in place to approve and segregate merger charges from other normal operating expenses to ensure that the company s operating results are properly reflected for period to period comparisons 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
in particular  a measure of earnings that excludes merger charges does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  merger charges are a reduction to earnings and stockholders equity

discontinued operations and merger charges non gaap b g critical accounting policies in preparing financial information  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expenses for the periods shown 
the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses  intangible assets excess purchase price and other identifiable intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights and income taxes  and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses allowance consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance based on the total of these two components 
determining the appropriate level of the allowance is one of the most critical and complex accounting estimates for any financial institution 
accounting guidance requires regions to make a number of estimates related to the level of credit losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
a full discussion of these estimates and other factors can be found in the allowance for credit losses section within the discussion of credit risk  found in a later section of this report 
the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors  such as portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings  and external factors  such as interest rates and the general health of the economy 
management reviews scenarios having different assumptions for variables that could result in increases or decreases in probable inherent credit losses  which may materially impact regions estimate of the allowance and results of operations 
management s estimate of the allowance for commercial products  which includes commercial  real estate construction and real estate mortgages except residential real estate mortgages and home equity lending  could be affected by risk rating upgrades or downgrades as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual credit due to factors particular to that credit  such as competition  management or business performance 
a reasonably possible scenario would be an estimated percent migration of lower risk related pass credits to criticized status  which could increase estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
a percent reduction in the level of criticized credits is also a reasonably possible scenario  which would result in an approximate million decrease in estimated inherent losses 
for residential real estate mortgages  home equity lending and other consumer related loans  individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools eg  residential real estate mortgage pool 
the total of all residential loans  including residential real estate mortgages and home equity lending  represents approximately percent of total loans 
losses can be affected by such factors as collateral value  loss severity  the economy and other uncontrollable factors 
a basis point increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these residential loans would change estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
the loss analysis related to consumer loans includes reasonably possible scenarios with estimated loss rates increasing or decreasing by basis points  which would increase or decrease the related estimated inherent losses by approximately million  respectively 
additionally  the estimate of the allowance for credit losses for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions  as evidenced by changes in interest rates  unemployment or employment rates  bankruptcy filings  used car prices  real estate demand and values  and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts and hurricanes 
while no one factor is dominant  each has the ability to result in actual loan losses that could differ materially from originally estimated amounts 
the pro forma inherent loss analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses excess purchase price and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles 
regions excess purchase price is tested for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of the business unit  or other factors could result in a decline in implied fair value of excess purchase price 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied fair value 
these changes or factors  when they occur  could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount 
these events or circumstances  when they occur  could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated 
mortgage servicing rights for purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing impairment  regions must estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights msrs 
msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices 
although sales of msrs do occur  the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available 
specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the value of the related msrs 
as a result  regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and contractual note rate  and values its msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques 
these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and discount rates 
changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds or other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge against earnings 
based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis  regions estimates that a reduction in primary mortgage market rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december  fair value of msrs by approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
conversely  basis point and basis point increases in these rates would increase the december  fair value of msrs by approximately eight percent million and percent million  respectively 
the pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
income taxes accrued taxes represent the estimated amount payable to or receivable from taxing jurisdictions  either currently or in the future  and are reported  on a net basis  as a component of other liabilities as regions is in a net payable position in the consolidated balance sheets 
the calculation of regions income tax expense is complex and requires the use of many estimates and judgments in its determination 
management s determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
from time to time  for certain business plans enacted by regions  management bases the estimates of related tax liabilities on its belief that future events will validate management s current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of tax related exposures 
while regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the anticipated tax treatment of these transactions should prevail and has assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment  examination of regions income tax returns  changes in tax law and regulatory guidance may impact the tax treatment of these transactions and resulting provisions for income taxes 
for example  as a result of normal examinations of regions income tax returns  regions has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for certain years 
regions believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been recorded and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments 
to the extent  however  that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments  regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate 
regions adopted fin as of january  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
operating results general net income totaled billion in  an eight percent decrease from net income 
net income from continuing operations  which excludes the operations of equifirst  increased two percent to billion in after tax merger related expenses of approximately million and million were incurred during and  respectively 
excluding the impact of merger related charges  earnings from continuing operations were billion in compared to billion in net interest income and margin net interest income interest income less interest expense is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals 
net interest income from continuing operations increased percent to billion in from billion in the increase is primarily related to a larger average earning asset base due to the amsouth merger 
regions measures its ability to produce net interest income using the net interest margin ratio  which is net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax exempt loans and securities 
the net interest margin decreased from percent in to percent in  largely a result of combining regions balance sheet with that of the former amsouth 
pre merger amsouth s net interest margin was lower than that of pre merger regions 
other than the merger  changes in the net interest margin during the year occurred primarily due to a decline in low cost deposits  a narrowing interest rate spread a result of changing market interest rates and their affect on the pricing and repricing of regions interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  branch divestitures  and a large tax deposit made with the internal revenue service irs 
although the tax deposit lowered the net interest margin  it was accretive to net income 
also  a lower tax equivalent adjustment  resulting from the january  adoption of fin relating to accounting for uncertain tax positions  contributed to year over year margin compression

comparing to  interest earning asset yields were slightly lower  decreasing five basis points  while interest bearing liability rates were higher  increasing basis points 
as a result  regions average interest rate spread declined to percent in as compared to percent in the year over year comparison of funding cost was most significantly impacted by the addition of amsouth s interest bearing liabilities  which carried a higher overall funding cost than that of pre merger regions 
aside from the merger  changes in market rates affected deposit pricing as well 
since a large portion of regions funding base is in the form of time deposits eg  certificates of deposits  it takes some period of time for the benefits of decreases in market rates to be realized and to impact the overall cost of funds for the company 
due to this repricing lag  in addition to intense competition for deposits throughout regions operating footprint  funding costs increased throughout the year 
in terms of changes in the broad interest rate environment  the fed funds rate  which is an influential driver of loan and deposit pricing on the shorter end of the yield curve  declined basis points during  ending the year at percent 
longer term rates experienced less movement  with the yield on the benchmark year us treasury note declining basis points over the same period and ending the year at percent 
both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were impacted by these changes in market rates 
in addition  as new loan production was added to the balance sheet during  these loans were made at yields lower than that of the existing portfolio 
the equifirst sale also affected overall interest earning asset yields  because the loans sold generally carried higher yields than the rest of regions loan portfolio 
the previously described branch divestitures also affected the net interest margin  since over half of the deposits divested were low cost or interest free in nature 
in addition  approximately billion of loans were sold in the divestiture transactions 
the combination of the lower interest earning asset base resulting from the loan divestitures  and the divestiture of low cost and interest free deposits  negatively impacted net interest income 
the annualized net interest income impact of the divestitures is approximately million 
the mix of interest earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread 
regions primary types of interest earning assets are loans and investment securities 
interest earning assets at december  totaled billion  a decrease of billion as compared to the prior year 
on an average basis  interest earning assets were percent higher in  largely the result of the full year inclusion of former amsouth balances 
the proportion of interest earning assets to total assets measures the effectiveness of management s efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable interest earning vehicles and represented percent and percent of total assets at year end and  respectively 
average loans as a percentage of interest earning assets was percent in and percent in the categories which comprise interest earning assets are shown in table consolidated average daily balances and yield rate analysis including discontinued operations 
another significant factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
funding for regions interest earning assets comes from interest bearing and non interest bearing sources 
the net spread on interest earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity is higher than the net spread on interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average interest bearing liabilities was percent in and percent in this increase negatively impacted the net interest margin in during and  regions used interest rate derivatives to hedge certain asset and liability positions 
these derivatives had the effect of decreasing net interest income by million in and decreasing it by million in see the risk management section later in this report for further detailed discussion 
table volume and yield rate variances provides additional information with which to analyze the changes in net interest income 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that in management s judgment is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses from continuing operations increased to million compared to million in this increase is reflective of an increase in management s estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  which was driven by two primary factors 
most notably  included just two months of provision for loan losses that were added to the portfolio as a result of the november merger with amsouth  while the provision recorded in was for the loan portfolio of the newly merged regions for the full year 
additionally  the provision rose due to an increase in management s estimate of losses inherent in its residential homebuilder portfolio  as well as generally weaker conditions in the broader economy 
net loan charge offs also rose during  increasing to million as compared to million in the resulting year end allowance for loan losses increased million to billion 
for further discussion of the total allowance for credit losses  see the risk management section found later in this report and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest income the following section contains a discussion of non interest income from continuing operations and excludes equifirst  which is reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
non interest income represents fees and income derived from sources other than interest earning assets 
table non interest income provides a detail of the components of non interest income 
non interest income excluding securities transactions totaled billion in compared to billion in the increase in non interest income is due primarily to full year inclusion of former amsouth operations in  compared with approximately two months of amsouth results in in addition to the merger related increase  service charges on deposit accounts and brokerage and investment banking income were strong during these increases were partially offset by decreases in mortgage income resulting from the mortgage banking environment  which became increasingly difficult as the year progressed

morgan keegan s revenues are predominantly recorded in the brokerage and investment banking and trust department income lines of the consolidated statements of income  while a smaller portion is reported in other non interest income 
morgan keegan contributed billion in total revenues in  up from billion in total brokerage and investment banking revenues increased percent to million in from million in part of this increase is again attributable to the november merger with amsouth  as only included approximately two months of combined results compared to a full year for merger benefits have been realized mainly through an expanded customer base  primarily through additional morgan keegan offices opened in the former amsouth retail branches 
results for were strong across the board and included strong private client revenues  healthy fixed income capital markets activity  solid equity capital markets revenues from good investment banking transaction flow  and higher trust and asset management fees 
morgan keegan s second quarter acquisition of shattuck hammond  an investment banking and financial advisory firm specializing in the health care industry  also bolstered fixed income capital markets revenues 
as of december   morgan keegan employed approximately  financial advisors 
customer assets under management were approximately billion at year end compared to approximately billion at year end revenues from the private client division  which was the top revenue producing line of business  totaled million  or percent of morgan keegan s total revenue in compared to million  or percent in the private client line of business benefited from equity markets volatility  as well as the increased number of financial advisors and branch outlets in related to opening morgan keegan offices in former amsouth branches throughout the footprint

the carrying value of these investments  which is equal to their estimated market value  was approximately million as of december  trust department income increased percent to million in  driven by full year inclusion of amsouth results 
the increase resulted from an increase in assets under management from both the merger and internal growth and higher fees

mortgage income decreased percent  from million in to million in  primarily due to the increasingly challenging mortgage industry environment see economic environment in regions banking markets later in this report  which deteriorated as the year progressed 
at december   regions servicing portfolio totaled billion and included approximately  loans 
of this portfolio  billion were serviced for third parties 
at december   the servicing portfolio totaled billion  billion of which were serviced for third parties

during the first quarter of  regions sold its non conforming mortgage origination subsidiary  equifirst for a sales price of approximately million and recorded an after tax gain of approximately million 
the sales price is subject to final resolution of closing date values of net assets sold  which is not yet completed 
see note discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
during the third quarter of  regions also exited the wholesale warehouse lending business as a result of risk and return considerations 
regions believes there will be no material effect on future revenue or earnings from continuing operations related to this business decision 
also late in  regions sold approximately billion of its billion out of market mortgage servicing portfolio  accounting for approximately million of its msr assets  realizing a loss on the sale of approximately million 
this loss is primarily due to market rate changes and transaction costs 
net securities gains losses regions reported net losses of million from the sale of securities available for sale in  as compared to net gains of million in the losses were primarily related to the sale of federal agency securities in conjunction with balance sheet management activities 
commercial credit fee income commercial credit fee income includes letters of credit fees and fees earned through regions executing capital market derivative transactions including interest rate swaps  caps and floors on its commercial customers behalf 
with respect to derivatives  in most instances  regions enters into offsetting positions  significantly reducing or eliminating its exposure to customer derivative positions 
derivative exposures are actively managed and marked to market on a daily basis 
commercial credit fee income increased million to million in compared to million in this increase was driven by higher customer derivative transactions  as customers actively managed their interest rate exposure in response to uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates 
insurance commissions insurance commissions and fees income increased percent to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increased revenue from the acquisition of miles finch during the year  increased commissions related to new business production  and increased cross selling efforts as a result of the amsouth merger within regions banking and brokerage segments

included in salaries and employee benefits are merger charges of million in and million in in addition to merger related items  drivers of the year over year increase include normal annual compensation adjustments and higher incentive payouts at morgan keegan  as well as merit increases in other areas of the company 
included in salaries and benefits are payroll taxes  which increased million due to the additional number of associates for the full year  combined with increased salary levels 
at december   regions had  employees compared to  at december  headcount reductions were largely the result of the sale of equifirst approximately  associates  merger related branch divestitures approximately associates  branch consolidations and normal attrition 
regions provides employees who meet established employment requirements with a benefits package that includes k  pension  and medical  life and disability insurance plans 
new enrollment in the regions pension plan ended effective december  new enrollment in the legacy amsouth pension plan ended effective with the merger date  november  former amsouth employees enrolled as of november  continue to be active in the plan  but no additional participants will be added 
effective september   the two pension plans merged into one plan 
regions k plans include a company match of eligible employee contributions 
at december   this match totaled percent of the eligible employee contribution up to six percent of compensation 
see note pension and other employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
there are various incentive plans in place in many of regions lines of business that are tied to the performance levels of employees 
at morgan keegan  commissions and incentives are a key component of compensation  which is typical in the brokerage and investment banking industry 
in general  incentives are used to reward employees for selling products and services  for productivity improvements and for achievement of corporate financial goals 
regions long term incentive plan provides for the granting of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares 
see note share based payments to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
net occupancy expense net occupancy expense includes rents  depreciation and amortization  utilities  maintenance  insurance  taxes  and other expenses of premises occupied by regions and its affiliates 
occupancy expense increased million  or percent  in due primarily to the full year inclusion of amsouth operations 
included in net occupancy expense were merger charges of million in and million in other increases were related to new and acquired branch offices and rising price levels 
in conjunction with the merger integration  regions consolidated branches into other existing branches in overlapping areas within its footprint 
furniture and equipment expense furniture and equipment expense increased million to million in this increase is due primarily to the additional offices and equipment acquired through the amsouth merger and the related depreciation expense 
professional fees professional fees expense is comprised of fees related to legal  consulting and other professional fees 
professional fees increased million to million in  of which million represent merger related charges 
the increase is attributable to higher consulting fees related to merger integration  legal fees related to special assets litigation resulting from credit deterioration  and miscellaneous merger related professional fees during the year 
marketing marketing expense increased million during including million of merger related charges to million from million in  primarily due to expenses related to post merger rebranding initiatives  marketing campaigns run to coincide with branch conversions  as well as customer communications associated with branch conversions and consolidations 
amortization of core deposit intangibles amortization of core deposit intangibles totaled million  an increase of million in  driven by amortization of million of core deposit intangibles related to the amsouth merger 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights and impairment of mortgage servicing rights amortization expense related to mortgage servicing rights increased percent to million in compared to million in declining market interest rates and higher prepayment assumptions drove changes in servicing asset valuations  leading to the increase in amortization expense in compared to impairment of mortgage servicing rights decreased by million compared to  representing the fluctuations in market values based on the period end dates 
other miscellaneous expenses other miscellaneous expenses include outside services  communications  and business and development services 
other non interest expenses also reflects non merger charges recorded in the latter half of  including a million charge for liabilities related to the visa usa inc antitrust lawsuit settlement with american express and other pending visa litigation reflecting regions share as a former visa member 
regions expects that proceeds from an anticipated share redemption related to its interest in visa s planned initial public offering should offset these charges in also included in other non interest expenses is million of losses related to investments in two morgan keegan mutual funds discussed earlier in this report 
income taxes regions provision for income taxes from continuing operations totaled million  an increase of million compared to regions effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent  as compared to percent in the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the full year inclusion of amsouth results and the adoption of fin as a result of the adoption of fin  regions recorded a cumulative reduction in equity of million as of january  during  the adoption of fin increased income tax expense and decreased after tax net income by approximately million 
from time to time  regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities 
while regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these strategies should prevail  examination of regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact the tax benefits of these plans 
periodically  regions invests in pass through investment vehicles that generate tax credits  principally low income housing credits and non conventional fuel source credits  which directly reduce regions federal income tax liability 
congress has enacted these tax credit programs to encourage capital inflows to these investment vehicles 
the amount of tax benefit recognized from these tax credits was million in compared to million in the non conventional fuel source credits  which totaled million in  expired at the end of regions has segregated a portion of its investment securities and intellectual property into separate legal entities in order to  among other business purposes  protect such tangible and intangible assets from inappropriate claims of regions creditors and to maximize the return on such assets by the professional and focused management thereof 
regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal entities of million in compared to million in with few exceptions in certain state jurisdictions  the company is no longer subject to us federal or state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before  which would include audits of acquired entities 
in the normal course of these examinations  regions is subject to challenges from governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due 
the irs and certain states have proposed various adjustments to the company s previously filed tax returns  including proposed adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of a mortgage related subsidiary and to the proper tax treatment of certain leveraged lease transactions that were entered into during the years under examination 
regions believes adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments 
to the extent that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments  regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate 
management s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing  nature and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
however  management does not believe that it is more likely than not that all of its state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established in the amount of million against such benefits in compared to million in see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the provision for income taxes 
balance sheet analysis at december   regions reported total assets of billion compared to billion at the end of  a decline of approximately billion or two percent 
the primary drivers of the decline were the merger related divestitures of amsouth branches  an investment securities portfolio that declined in size as a result of interest rate sensitivity management efforts coupled with unfavorable reinvestment alternatives  and lower demand for certain categories of loans 
loans average loans  net of unearned income  represented percent of total interest earning assets at december  lending at regions is generally organized along three functional lines commercial loans including financial and agricultural  real estate loans and consumer loans 
the composition of the portfolio by these major categories  with real estate loans further broken down between mortgage and construction loans  and consumer loans further broken down into home equity  indirect and other consumer loans  is presented in table loan portfolio 
year end total loans  net of unearned income  remained relatively flat for versus a challenging economic environment  particularly in the real estate sector  was the primary factor leading to the modest growth rate 
table shows a year over year comparison of loans by loan type 
however  loan classifications within this table have been impacted by conversion related re mapping during  making year over year comparisons difficult 
in general  the reclassifications shifted balances from the commercial category into the real estate mortgage or real estate construction categories 
table loan portfolio in thousands  net of unearned income commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction home equity indirect other consumer table selected loan maturities loans maturing within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction predetermined rate variable rate in thousands due after one year but within five years due after five years table excludes residential real estate mortgage  home equity  indirect and other consumer loans 
commercial loans commercial loans represent loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases or other expansion projects 
real estate mortgage loans real estate mortgage loans consist of loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings  loans for real estate development residential and income producing property types  residential home mortgages and various other loans secured by real estate 
while demand for residential mortgage loans remained at normal levels during the first half of  growth slowed later in the year as the credit markets contracted due to softening in the housing market 
loans to consumers with weak credit history  generally called sub prime loans  were a cause for industry concern in as the performance of these loans deteriorated significantly during the year 
regions exposure to sub prime loans is insignificant  at approximately million at december   and continues to decline 
the credit loss exposure related to these loans is addressed in management s periodic determination of the allowance for credit losses 
real estate construction loans real estate construction loans are loans to individuals  companies or developers used for the purchase or construction of a commercial property for which repayment will be generated by cash flows related to the operation  sale or refinance of the property 
a significant portion of regions real estate construction portfolio is comprised of residential product types land  single family and condo loans within regions markets followed by retail and multi family projects 
typically  these loans are for construction projects that have been presold  preleased or otherwise have secured permanent financing as well as loans to real estate companies that have significant equity invested in each project 
during late  the residential homebuilder portfolio  which totaled billion as of december   came under significant stress 
in table loan portfolio  the majority of these loans is reported in the real estate construction loan category  while a smaller portion is reported as real estate mortgage loans 
the residential homebuilder portfolio is geographically concentrated in florida and regions east region  mainly atlanta  georgia 
regions has realigned its organizational structure to enable some of the company s most experienced bankers to concentrate their efforts on management of this portfolio 
see the credit risk section later in this report for further detail on the residential homebuilder portfolio 
home equity lending home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in addition  changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses 
during  home equity lending balances increased slightly over the year ended december  indirect lending indirect lending  which is lending initiated through third party business partners  is largely comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships 
loans of this type decreased million  or two percent  during due to a generally weaker economy 
this lending category has historically included marine loans and loans on recreational vehicles 
regions made a business decision to no longer offer these lines of lending in due to this decision  these loans are a declining element in the overall loan portfolio 
outstanding marine and recreational vehicle loans totaled approximately billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
other consumer loans other consumer loans include all consumer loans not classified as real estate mortgage  home equity or indirect  including direct consumer installment loans  bankcard  overdrafts and other revolving credit  and educational loans 
other consumer loans increased four percent in versus loans held for sale at december   loans held for sale totaled million and consisted of residential real estate mortgage loans in the process of being sold to third parties 
at december   loans held for sale totaled billion and consisted of billion of residential real estate mortgage loans including billion of equifirst loans and student loans  and billion of loans to be sold related to the branch divestitures 
excluding the divested loans  loans held for sale decreased billion  due mainly to the sale of equifirst 
in addition  lower origination volumes and tightening of the secondary market for mortgage production  as a result of the weakening housing market in  contributed to the decrease during allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in both the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance consists of two components the allowance for loans losses  which is recorded as a contra asset to loans  and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments  which is recorded in other liabilities 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled billion or percent of total loans  net of unearned income  compared to billion or percent at year end see allowance for credit losses in the risk management section found later in this report for a detailed discussion of the allowance 
securities regions utilizes the securities portfolio to manage liquidity  interest rate risk  regulatory capital  and to take advantage of market conditions to generate a favorable return on investments without undue risk 
the portfolio consists primarily of high quality mortgage backed and asset backed securities  as well as us treasury and federal agency securities 
securities represented percent of total assets at december  compared with percent at december  in  total securities  which are almost entirely classified as available for sale  decreased billion  or six percent 
this contraction of the portfolio was largely the result of prepayments of mortgage backed securities  management s decision in general not to reinvest funds from the maturity of securities back into a relatively unattractive securities market  as well as sales during in conjunction with balance sheet management activities 
the interest rate risk section  found later in this report  further explains regions interest rate risk management practices 
the weighted average yield earned on securities  less equities  was percent in and table securities illustrates the carrying values of securities by category 
table securities in thousands securities us treasury securities federal agency securities obligations of states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities other debt securities equity securities at december   securities available for sale included a net unrealized gain of million  which represented the difference between the estimated fair value of these securities as of year end and their amortized cost 
at december   securities available for sale included a net unrealized loss of million 
the net unrealized gain at december   reflects the impact on bond prices of declining interest rates in as well as purchases  maturities and sales throughout the year 
net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  net of tax 
in january  regions sold approximately billion of agency debentures and recognized a gain of approximately million 
approximately million of the related proceeds were reinvested in us treasury securities classified as trading  which are expected to be sold during the first quarter of the remainder of the proceeds  approximately million  was reinvested in mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale 
also during january  regions sold approximately million in us treasury securities classified as trading account assets and recognized a gain of approximately million 
maturity analysis the average life of the securities portfolio at december  was estimated to be years  with a duration of approximately years 
these metrics compare with an estimated average life of years  with a duration of approximately years for the portfolio at december  table relative contractual maturities and weighted average yields for securities provides additional details

the risk of loss from these receivables is minimized by requiring that customers maintain marketable securities in the brokerage account that have a fair market value substantially in excess of the funds advanced to the customer 
premises and equipment premises and equipment at december  increased million to billion compared to year end this increase primarily resulted from the opening of new branches during  partially offset by the divestiture of branches in excess purchase price excess purchase price at december  totaled billion as compared to billion at december   with the increase driven by finalizing the purchase price adjustments related to the amsouth merger 
see note business combinations and assets held for sale to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the amsouth related excess purchase price 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights at december  totaled million compared to million at december  a summary of mortgage servicing rights is presented in table mortgage servicing rights 
the balances shown represent the right to service mortgage loans that are owned by other investors and include original amounts capitalized  less accumulated amortization and a valuation allowance 
the carrying values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various factors  including estimated prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
a significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments  thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights 
the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance increased by million in  due to lower mortgage rates and corresponding increased estimated prepayment speeds 
on december   mortgage servicing rights on approximately billion of loans in regions out of market servicing portfolio  totaling approximately million  were sold for a loss of million

see note intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
other assets other assets increased billion to billion as of december  this increase is primarily related to a tax deposit made with the irs and an million purchase of bank owned life insurance during the latter part of the year 
also included in other assets during the year were investments of approximately million in the regions morgan keegan rmk select high income fund and approximately million in the rmk select intermediate bond fund  purchased by morgan keegan to provide liquidity support to these funds 
both of these funds are proprietary open end mutual funds managed by morgan keegan 
a portion of the regions morgan keegan select high income fund investments were sold during during  regions recognized total losses of approximately million on these investments in accordance with the equity method of accounting  the majority of which is included in other non interest expense 
these investments are recorded at market value in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and totaled approximately million at december  deposits deposits are regions primary source of funds  providing funding for percent of average interest earning assets in and percent in table deposits details year over year deposits on a period ending basis 
deposits as of year end decreased billion  or six percent  compared to year end the decrease in deposits was partially attributable to the merger related branch divestitures  which occurred in the first quarter of deposits totaling billion  including million of non interest bearing deposits and billion of interest bearing deposits  were sold in those branch divestitures 
excluding the impact of the divested deposits  year end total deposits decreased four percent in table deposits in thousands non interest bearing demand non interest bearing demand divestitures total non interest bearing deposits savings accounts interest bearing transaction accounts money market accounts time deposits foreign deposits interest bearing deposits divestitures total interest bearing deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market 
regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposit product offerings and how effectively the company meets customers needs 
regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness  such as providing well designed products  a high level of customer service  competitive pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to offer convenient branch locations for its customers 
regions also serves customers through providing centralized  high quality telephone banking services and alternative product delivery channels  such as internet banking 
non interest bearing deposits  excluding divested deposits  declined by nine percent in as customers migrated to interest bearing offerings  including regions interest bearing checking accounts  among other product types or investment alternatives 
divested non interest bearing deposits totaled approximately million 
non interest bearing deposits accounted for approximately percent of total deposits in as compared to percent at year end excluding divested deposits 
savings balances  excluding divested deposits  declined six percent to billion  generally reflecting customers preference for higher yielding accounts  including money market accounts 
interest bearing transaction accounts remained relatively stable at december  compared to december   due to the success of a marketing campaign aimed toward garnering free interest checking accounts during the year 
money market products are one of regions most significant funding sources  accounting for percent of total deposits in in  the balance of money market accounts  excluding divested deposits  remained relatively stable compared to  primarily due to regions aggressive sales efforts related to this product 
however  the relative attractiveness of alternative investment opportunities  including equity products and other potentially higher yielding investments  partially offset growth of money market balances 
in addition  deposits divested in the first quarter of in connection with the merger also contributed to the year over year decline 
included in time deposits are certificates of deposits and individual retirement accounts 
the balance of time deposits decreased six percent in  primarily due to divested deposits and a balance sheet management strategy that allowed higher rate deposits to run off 
these decreases were partially offset by customer demand for higher rate deposits 
time deposits accounted for percent of total deposits in foreign deposits increased by million during  due to increased levels of wholesale eurodollar funding  partially offset by lower demand for customer sweep accounts 
the sensitivity of regions deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased to percent in from percent in while the federal funds rate decreased basis points during to percent at year end  these decreases were not instituted until late in the year 
therefore  the impact on average rates was minimal as a lag period exists between the change in market rates and the repricing of the deposits

balances in these accounts can fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis 
federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements totaled billion at december  and billion at december  the balance of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements  net of federal funds sold and security reverse repurchase agreements  increased million in  due primarily to a change in the funding mix between years 
in october  regions began participating in the federal reserve s treasury  tax and loan program 
this program provides regions with an alternative source of short term funding and aids in maintaining the stability of the financial markets by reducing uncertainty about the supply of reserves in the banking system and simplifying the federal reserve s implementation of monetary policy

as such  regions does not expect to repurchase a significant number of its shares in regions ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was percent at december  compared to percent at december  this ratio decreased during due to share repurchase activity  which lowered stockholders equity 
regions ratio of tangible stockholders equity stockholders equity less excess purchase price and other identifiable intangibles to total tangible assets was percent at december  compared to percent at december   mainly reflecting the repurchase activity discussed above 
regions attempts to balance the return to stockholders through the payment of dividends with the need to maintain strong capital levels for future growth opportunities 
in  on a per share basis  regions returned percent of earnings to its stockholders in the form of dividends 
total dividends paid by regions in were billion  or per share  an increase of four percent from the per share paid in in october  the board of directors declared a six percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share  marking the th consecutive year that regions has increased quarterly cash dividends 
bank regulatory capital requirements regions and regions bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking regulatory agencies 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and interest rate risks  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with specified risk weighting factors 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
banking organizations that are considered to have excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain higher levels of capital 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is eight percent 
at least percent of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less excess purchase price and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatorily convertible securities  subordinated debt and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations that supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum ratio of three percent of tier capital to average assets less excess purchase price the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of one percent to two percent above the minimum three percent level 
table capital ratios summarizes regions capital ratios at december   which substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements 
total capital at regions bank also has an important effect on the amount of federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance premiums paid 
institutions not considered well capitalized can be subject to higher rates for fdic insurance 
other requirements are needed in addition to total capital in order for a company to be considered well capitalized 
see note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
as of december   regions bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized 
under the federal deposit insurance reform act of and the fdic s revised premium assessment program  every fdic insured institution will pay some level of deposit insurance assessments regardless of the level of designated reserve ratio 
regions bank had a fico assessment of million in fdic deposit premiums in and million in  both of which were expensed in their respective years 
the fdic also has finalized rules providing for a one time credit to each eligible insured depository institution based on the assessment base of the institution on december  regions bank qualified for a credit of approximately million  of which million was applied in  leaving a remaining balance at year end of million to be applied over the next two years  based on the current assessment rate

off balance sheet arrangements regions primary off balance sheet arrangements are financial instruments issued in connection with lending activities 
these arrangements include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion  including details of the contractual amounts outstanding at december  regions sells commercial loans to third party  multi issuer conduits  and regions retains servicing responsibilities 
as part of the sale and securitization of commercial loans to conduits  regions provides credit enhancements to these conduits by providing standby letters of credit  which create exposure to credit risk to the extent of the letters of credit 
at december   regions had million of letters of credit supporting the conduit sales 
this credit risk is reviewed quarterly and a reserve for loss exposure is maintained in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
regions also provides liquidity lines of credit to support the issuance of commercial paper under day loan commitments 
these liquidity lines can be drawn upon in the event of a commercial paper market disruption or other factors  which could prevent the asset backed commercial paper issuers from being able to issue commercial paper 
regions had million of commercial loans in the conduits on december  for additional discussion  see the liquidity section of this report 
regions also has certain variable interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities ie  regions is not the primary beneficiary 
regions owns the common stock of subsidiary business trusts  which have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities in the aggregate of million at the time of issuance 
also  regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects  which are funded through a combination of debt and equity with equity typically comprising percent to percent of the total partnership capital 
regions maximum exposure to loss as of december  was million  which included million in unfunded commitments to the partnerships 
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of regions ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
risk management risk identification and risk management are key elements in the overall management of regions 
management believes the primary risk exposures are interest rate and associated prepayment risk  liquidity risk  market and other brokerage related risk associated with morgan keegan and credit risk 
interest rate risk is the risk to net interest income due to the impact of movements in interest rates 
prepayment risk is the risk that borrowers may repay their loans or securities earlier than at their stated maturities 
liquidity risk relates to regions ability to fund present and future obligations 
the company  through morgan keegan  is also subject to various market related risks associated with its brokerage and market related activities 
credit risk represents the possibility that borrowers may not be able to repay loans 
external factors beyond management s control may result in losses despite risk management efforts 
management follows a formal policy to evaluate and document the key risks facing each line of business  how those risks can be controlled or mitigated  and how management monitors the controls to ensure that they are effective 
regions internal audit division performs ongoing  independent reviews of the risk management process and assures the adequacy of documentation 
the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company also has a risk committee that assists the board of directors in overseeing the company s policies  procedures and practices relating to market  regulatory and operational risk 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control these and other risks are described in the remainder of this report 
interest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk  including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels  which is impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers 
to quantify this risk  regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario 
net interest income sensitivity is a useful short term indicator of regions interest rate risk 
sensitivity measurement financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure 
using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet 
assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior 
among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition  the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business 
interest rate related risks are expressly considered  such as pricing spreads  the lag time in pricing administered rate accounts  prepayments and other option risks 
regions considers these factors  as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior 
financial derivative instruments are used in hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against changes in interest rates 
the effect of these hedges is included in the simulations of net interest income 
the primary objective of asset liability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles 
a standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure limits 
the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus and basis points 
in addition  regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements 
the gradual scenarios include curve steepening  flattening and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a six month period 
exposure to interest rate movements as of december   regions was moderately asset sensitive in positioning to both gradual and instantaneous rate shifts of plus or minus or basis points 
table interest rate sensitivity demonstrates the estimated potential effects that gradual over six months beginning at december  and  respectively and instantaneous parallel interest rate shifts would have on regions net interest income 
in january  the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate by basis points in response to mounting concerns of a recession 
as indicated above  regions was moderately asset sensitive at year end and was in a similar position at the time of the federal reserve actions 
as a result  regions expects to experience a reduction in net interest income  which can be gauged by referring to table interest rate sensitivity 
table interest rate sensitivity estimated change in net interest income december gradual change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points estimated change in net interest income december instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee alco  in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity  approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies 
the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts  interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  and forward sale commitments 
derivatives are also used to hedge the risks associated with customer derivatives 
forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable streams of interest payments 
the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements 
interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time 
forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price 
foreign exchange forwards are contractual agreements to receive or deliver a foreign currency at an agreed upon future date and price 
regions has made use of interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate position and  in some cases  to effectively convert a portion of its variable rate loan portfolio to fixed rate 
regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business 
futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing 
in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans  changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio 
regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolio by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions 
for non dealer transactions  the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty 
credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements 
when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place  the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and or posted to that counterparty 
the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk 
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers 
interest rate swaps  interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers 
positions with similar characteristics are used to hedge the market risk and minimize income statement volatility associated with this portfolio 
instruments used to service customers are entered into the trading account  with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
the objective of regions hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes  from an economic perspective  on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet 
the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions  the quality of regions execution  the accuracy of its valuation assumptions  counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates 
as a result  regions hedging strategies may be ineffective in mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings 
see to note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions year end derivatives positions 
prepayment risk regions  like most financial institutions  is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets under different interest rate environments 
prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor  so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates 
as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment  regions must reinvest these funds in lower yielding assets 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions interest income and overall asset yields 
conversely  in a rising rate environment  these assets will prepay at a slower rate  resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates 
regions greatest exposure to prepayment risks primarily rests in its mortgage backed securities portfolio  the mortgage fixed rate loan portfolio and the mortgage servicing asset  all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements 
regions also has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non interest income in the form of servicing income on loans sold 
regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management 
liquidity risk liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
table contractual obligations summarizes regions contractual cash obligations at december  regions intends to fund contractual obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations 
in addition to these obligations  regions has obligations related to uncertain tax positions see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements  obligations related to its ownership interest in visa usa inc see discussion of other non interest expense found earlier in this report  and potential litigation contingencies see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
assets  consisting principally of loans and securities  are funded by customer deposits  purchased funds  borrowed funds and stockholders equity 
regions goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting its cash flow needs 
this is accomplished through the active management of both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet 
the liquidity position of regions is monitored on a daily basis by regions treasury division 
in addition  the alco  which consists of members of regions senior management team  reviews liquidity on a regular basis and approves any changes in strategy that are necessary as a result of asset liability composition or anticipated cash flow changes 
management also compares regions liquidity position to established corporate liquidity policies on a monthly basis 
table contractual obligations payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands long term borrowings time deposits lease obligations purchase obligations other the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see table relative contractual maturities and weighted average yields for securities 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds see table selected loan maturities 
at december   commercial loans  real estate construction loans and certain real estate mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of billion  as well as securities of million  were due to mature in one year or less 
additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
historically  regions high levels of earnings have also contributed to cash flow 
in addition  liquidity needs can be met by the purchase of funds in state and national money markets 
regions liquidity also continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable deposit base 
as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  operating activities provided significant levels of funds in  due primarily to high levels of net income 
investing activities were a net provider of funds in  primarily due to proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities available for sale and the proceeds from sales of student loans  partially offset by the purchase of securities available for sale and increased lending activity 
financing activities were a net user of funds in  reflecting a decrease in deposits  payments made on borrowings and repurchase of regions stock in regions financing arrangement with the fhlb adds additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position 
the maximum amount that could be borrowed from the fhlb under the current borrowing agreement is approximately billion see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the fhlb 
at december   approximately billion of first mortgage loans on one to four family dwellings held by regions bank were pledged to secure borrowings from the fhlb 
investment in fhlb stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings 
regions held million in fhlb stock at december  the fhlb has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding 
as of december   regions borrowings from the fhlb totaled billion 
as mentioned previously in the long term borrowings section of this report  in may  regions filed a shelf registration statement 
the shelf allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of various debt and or equity securities 
in addition  regions bank has the requisite agreements in place to issue and sell up to billion of bank notes to institutional investors through placement agents as of december  the issuance of additional bank notes could provide a significant source of liquidity and funding to meet future needs 
morgan keegan maintains certain lines of credit with unaffiliated banks to manage liquidity in the ordinary course of business 
see note short term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
regions can borrow a maximum amount of approximately billion from the federal reserve bank 
see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
as an additional source of liquidity  regions periodically sells commercial loans to qualifying special purpose entities known as conduits in securitization transactions 
the conduits are financed by the issuance of securities to asset backed commercial paper issuers 
the transactions are accounted for as sales and allow regions to utilize its asset capacity and capital for higher yielding interest earning assets  while continuing to manage customer relationships 
at december   the outstanding balance of commercial loans sold to conduits was million compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to unfavorable conditions in the asset backed commercial paper market which developed in the latter half of  leading management to reduce exposure in this area 
while the conduit transactions are a source of funding  these off balance sheet arrangements have the potential to require regions to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a liquidity shortage 
if regions is unable to maintain or renew its financing arrangements  obtain funding in the capital markets on reasonable terms or experiences a decrease in earnings  it may be required to slow or reduce the growth of the assets on its balance sheet  which may adversely impact its earnings 
market and other brokerage related risk morgan keegan s business activities  including its securities inventory positions and securities held for investment  expose it to market risk 
morgan keegan trades for its own account in corporate and tax exempt securities and us government agency and guaranteed securities 
most of these transactions are entered into to facilitate the execution of customers orders to buy or sell these securities 
in addition  it trades certain equity securities in order to make a market in these securities 
morgan keegan s trading activities require the commitment of capital 
all principal transactions place the subsidiary s capital at risk 
profits and losses are dependent upon the skills of employees and market fluctuations 
in order to mitigate the risks of carrying inventory and as part of other normal brokerage activities  morgan keegan assumes short positions on securities 
the establishment of short positions exposes morgan keegan to off balance sheet risk in the event that prices increase  as it may be obligated to cover such positions at a loss 
morgan keegan manages its exposure to these instruments by entering into offsetting or other positions in a variety of financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments 
at december   the contract amounts of futures contracts were million to purchase and million to sell us government and municipal securities 
morgan keegan typically settles its position by entering into equal but opposite contracts and  as such  the contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
settlement of the transactions relating to such commitments is not expected to have a material effect on regions consolidated financial position 
transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument 
regions exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors  including the size  composition and diversification of positions held  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  and market volatility 
additionally  in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery  to be announced securities  which are recorded in trading account assets on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities underlying the instruments 
the credit risk associated with these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing all contracts on which morgan keegan has recorded an unrealized gain 
for exchange traded contracts  the clearing organization acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and  therefore  bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties 
interest rate risk at morgan keegan arises from the exposure of holding interest sensitive financial instruments such as government  corporate and municipal bonds  and certain preferred equities 
morgan keegan manages its exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  entering into offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
securities inventories  recorded in trading account assets on the consolidated balance sheets  are marked to market and  accordingly  there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value 
while a significant portion of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over in excess of twelve times per year 
accordingly  the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in morgan keegan s securities inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments held by firms in other industries 
morgan keegan s equity securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event of unfavorable price movements 
also  morgan keegan is subject to credit risk arising from non performance by trading counterparties  customers and issuers of debt securities owned 
this risk is managed by imposing and monitoring position limits  monitoring trading counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral  and conducting business through clearing organizations that guarantee performance 
morgan keegan regularly participates in the trading of some derivative securities for its customers  however  this activity does not involve morgan keegan acquiring a position or commitment in these products and this trading is not a significant portion of morgan keegan s business 
to manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks  regions uses a value at risk var model to estimate the potential fair value the company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon 
the end of period var was approximately million as of december  and approximately  as of december  maximum daily var utilization during was million and average daily var during the same period was million 
credit risk regions objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a high quality credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle 
management process regions employs a credit risk management process with defined policies  accountability and regular reporting to manage credit risk in the loan portfolio 
credit risk management is guided by credit policies that provide for a consistent and prudent approach to underwriting and approvals of credits 
within the credit policy department  procedures exist that elevate the approval requirements as credits become larger and more complex 
generally  consumer credits and smaller commercial credits are centrally underwritten based on custom credit matrices that are modified as appropriate 
larger commercial and commercial real estate transactions are individually underwritten  risk rated  approved and monitored 
responsibility and accountability for adherence to underwriting policies and accurate risk ratings lies in the lines of business 
for consumer and small business portfolios  the risk management process focuses on managing customers who become delinquent in their payments and managing performance of the credit scorecards  which are periodically adjusted based on credit performance 
commercial business units are responsible for underwriting new business and on an ongoing basis  monitoring the credit of their portfolios  including a complete review of the borrower semi annually or more frequently as needed 
to ensure problem commercial credits are identified on a timely basis  several specific portfolio reviews occur each quarter to assess the larger adversely rated credits for accrual status and  if necessary  to ensure such individual credits are transferred to regions special asset group  which specializes in managing distressed credit exposures 
separate and independent commercial credit and consumer credit risk management organizational groups exist  which report to the chief credit officer 
these organizational units partner with the business line to assist in the processes described above  including the review and approval of new business and ongoing assessments of existing loans in the portfolio 
independent commercial and consumer credit risk management provides for more accurate risk ratings and the timely identification of problem credits  as well as oversight for the chief credit officer on conditions and trends in the credit portfolios 
credit quality and trends in the loan portfolio are measured and monitored regularly and detailed reports  by product and business unit  are reviewed by line of business personnel and the chief credit officer 
the chief credit officer reviews summaries of these credit reports with executive management and the board of directors 
finally  the credit review department provides ongoing independent oversight of the credit portfolios to ensure policies are followed  credits are properly risk rated and that key credit control processes are functioning as intended 
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in order to assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  it is appropriate to consider the current us economic environment and that of regions primary banking markets  as well as risk factors within the three major categories of loans commercial  real estate and consumer 
economic environment in regions banking markets the largest factor influencing the credit performance of regions loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the us and the primary markets in which it operates 
the us economy slowed in  as evidenced by declining growth in gross domestic product and a notably weaker housing market 
housing weakened considerably during and the risk of recession is significantly increasing due to the negative impact housing is having on the overall economy 
this weakness prompted the federal reserve to cut interest rates during the second half of and into  including the basis points cuts in january  in order to add liquidity to the markets 
within the regions footprint  the housing slowdown has been relatively severe in parts of florida  and atlanta  georgia has also experienced pockets of overbuilding 
both areas had experienced above average price increases and construction activity in recent years 
the slowdown is manifesting itself through decreases in housing permits  starts and sales  falling prices and excess unsold inventory on the market 
management anticipates that the housing industry will remain weak throughout while the conditions outside of the residential real estate industry remain generally sound  there has been a decrease in job creation and increases in unemployment in states within our footprint 
industries reliant upon a strong housing market are being negatively affected  including title and mortgage companies  and manufacturers  wholesalers and retailers of building supplies  home furnishings and appliances 
the economic environment became more challenging during  particularly for borrowers directly or indirectly tied to the housing industry 
other indicators of economic strains include oil prices that have continued to increase  consumer debt levels remaining at record levels and the consumer savings rate being negative 
additionally  the volumes of adjustable rate mortgages subject to rate reset will be at record levels over the next to months on a national basis 
these factors will only add more strain to consumers 
portfolio characteristics regions has a well diversified loan portfolio  in terms of product type  collateral and geography 
at december   commercial loans represented percent of total loans  net of unearned income  real estate mortgage loans including residential one to four family represented percent  real estate construction loans were percent and consumer loans comprised the remaining percent 
commercial the commercial loan portfolio totaled billion at year end and primarily consists of loans to middle market commercial customers doing business in regions geographic footprint 
loans in this portfolio are generally underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
net charge offs on commercial loans were percent of average commercial loans in compared to percent in this increase was due in large part to the performance of a small number of specific credits 
real estate mortgage the real estate mortgage portfolio totaled billion at year end and includes various loan types 
a large portion is owner occupied loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed in the commercial business line 
regions attempts to minimize risk on owner occupied properties by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount  adequate cash flow to service the debt  and in many cases  the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers 
another large component of real estate mortgage loans is loans to real estate developers and investors for the financing of land or buildings  where the repayment is generated from the sale of the real estate or income generated by the real estate property 
while losses on these types of real estate mortgage loans have been very low for a number of years  they did rise in in reaction to a slowing economy and its effects on demand for real estate properties 
regions expects that losses on these types of loans will continue to rise during also included in the real estate mortgage loan category are loans on one to four family residential properties  which are secured principally by single family residences 
loans of this type are generally smaller in size and are geographically dispersed throughout regions market areas  with some guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers 
losses on the residential loan portfolio depend  to a large degree  on the level of interest rates  the unemployment rate  economic conditions and collateral values  and thus  are difficult to predict 
during  losses on single family residences were relatively low 
however  regions expects losses on loans of this type to increase moderately during  driven by the general housing slowdown throughout the us  including areas within regions operating footprint 
real estate construction these loans are primarily extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral 
a construction loan may also be made to a commercial business for the development of land or buildings where the repayment is usually derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that also manages loan disbursements during the construction process 
as of december   real estate construction loans were billion or percent of regions total loan portfolio 
most construction credits were to finance shopping centers  apartment complexes  condominiums  commercial buildings and residential property development 
these loans are generally vulnerable to economic downturns in periods of high interest rates and declines in property values 
included in the real estate construction loan category are loans to residential homebuilders 
the chart and table below provide details related to this residential homebuilder portfolio  which totaled billion at december  further details about this portfolio are also provided in the balance sheet analysis section  found earlier in this report 
credit quality of the construction portfolio is sensitive to risks associated with construction loans such as cost overruns  project completion risk  general contractor credit risk  environmental and other hazard risks  and market risks associated with the sale or rental of completed properties 
while losses within this portfolio have been low historically  they increased in largely as a result of the stresses described above 
these stresses are expected to continue throughout and  accordingly  losses on real estate construction loans are expected to continue to rise as well

losses on home equity and other consumer lending began to increase in the latter half of due to deterioration of general economic conditions  including unfavorable changes in housing demand and property values 
these portfolios will continue to be impacted by these factors  which regions believes will remain pressured in and  therefore  the company expects losses to rise modestly during allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of year end 
the allowance for credit losses consists of two components the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on the combination of both of these components 
regions determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with regulatory guidance  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
binding unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit  financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled billion or percent of total loans  net of unearned income compared to billion or percent at year end the increase in the allowance for credit loss ratio reflects management s estimate of the level of inherent losses in the portfolio  which management believes increased significantly during the fourth quarter of due to a slowing economy and a weakening housing market 
the increase in non performing assets was a key determining factor in the assessment of inherent losses and  as a result  was an important factor in determining the allowance level 
non performing assets increased from million at december  to million at december   with million of the increase occurring during the fourth quarter of details regarding the allowance for credit losses  including an analysis of activity from the previous year s total  are included in table allowance for credit losses 
management expects the allowance for credit loss ratio to vary over time due to changes in economic conditions  loan mix and collateral values  or variations in other factors that may affect inherent losses 
factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses include  but are not limited to detailed reviews of individual loans  historical and current trends in gross and net loan charge offs for the various portfolio segments evaluated  the level of the allowance for credit losses in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels  levels and trends in non performing and past due loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  the composition of the loan portfolio  including unfunded credit commitments  and management s analysis of economic conditions 
various departments  including credit review  commercial and consumer credit risk management  and special assets  are involved in the credit risk management process to assess the accuracy of risk ratings  the quality of the portfolio and the estimation of inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio 
this comprehensive process also assists in the prompt identification of problem credits 
for the majority of the loan portfolio  management uses information from its ongoing review processes to stratify the loan portfolio into pools sharing common risk characteristics 
loans that share common risk characteristics are assigned a portion of the allowance for credit losses based on the assessment process described above 
credit exposures are categorized by type and assigned estimated amounts of inherent loss based on several factors  including current and historical loss experience for each pool and management s judgment of current economic conditions and their expected impact on credit performance 
impaired loans are defined as commercial and commercial real estate loans excluding leases on non accrual status 
all loans that management has identified as impaired  and that are greater than million  are evaluated individually for purposes of determining appropriate allowances for credit losses 
this process results in what are internally called fas specific reserves 
in the specific reserve process  loans are valued based on the most suitable valuation technique as defined in fas see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
if current valuations are lower than the current book balance of the credit  the negative differences are reviewed for possible charge off 
in instances where management determines that a charge off is not appropriate  a fas specific reserve is established for the individual loan in question 
that specific reserve is incorporated as a part of the overall allowance for credit losses 
at december   loans qualifying for fas consideration totaled million with specific reserves of million 
this compares to total loans qualifying for fas of million with specific reserves of million at december  management considers the current level of allowance for credit losses adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for credit losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates

uncollected interest income accrued on non accrual loans in the current year is reversed and charged to interest income 
uncollected interest accrued from prior years on loans placed on non accrual status in the current year is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  or percent of ending loans  compared to million  or percent of loans  at december  the increase in non performing assets at december   was largely influenced by growth in non performing loans in the fourth quarter of due to the residential homebuilder portfolio as previously discussed 
sales of non accrual loans during the second half of totaling million partially offset the otherwise higher level of non performing assets 
associated with the non performing loans sale  regions recorded an additional million of loan loss provision  which coupled with million of existing reserves on these loans resulted in an million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter of changes in economic conditions and real estate demand in regions markets are likely to further increase the level of non performing assets during foreclosed properties  a subset of non performing assets  totaled million at december  and million at december  regions foreclosed properties are composed primarily of a number of small to medium size properties that are diversified geographically throughout the franchise 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value less the estimated cost to sell

at december   none of the million from remained categorized as potential problem loans 
these loans either migrated to non performing status or were no longer considered potential problem loans 
as a result of the unfavorable trends in credit quality previously described  including the expectation of rising non performing asset levels driven largely by deterioration in the company s residential homebuilder portfolio  management expects that net loan charge offs could rise to percent to percent of net loans for the year ended december  this forecast was made as of year end and actual results could vary from this forecast  which is subject to changes in assumed underlying economic conditions and other influential factors 
financial disclosure and internal controls regions has always maintained internal controls over financial reporting  which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us as a bank holding company  regions is subject to the internal control reporting and attestation requirements of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act and  therefore  is very familiar with the process of maintaining and evaluating internal controls over financial reporting

these risks  control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format 
this format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts  but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective 
these monitoring procedures are also part of management s testing of internal controls 
at least quarterly  each area updates and assesses the adequacy of its documented internal controls 
if changes are necessary  updates are made more frequently 
regions also has established processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained 
these controls and procedures as defined by the sec are generally designed to ensure that financial and non financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is communicated to management  including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
regions disclosure review committee  which includes representatives from the legal  risk management  accounting  investor relations and audit departments  meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the sec

the forms k and q are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the audit committee on a quarterly basis 
as required by applicable regulatory pronouncements  the ceo and the cfo review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of regions periodic public reports filed with the sec  as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
with the assistance of the financial review committees  regions will continue to assess and monitor disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting  and will make refinements as necessary

return on average stockholders equity was percent for as compared to percent for  while return on average assets was percent for  up from the level of percent 
during  the federal reserve raised interest rates four times basis points 
the yield curve became inverted due to short term rates increasing without similar increases in long term rates 
however  regions was able to counter this effect with prudent loan and deposit pricing and balance sheet positioning 
as a result  increases in regions interest earning asset yields outpaced increases in interest bearing liability costs  leading to an increased interest rate spread compared to this increase in spread helped bolster the net interest margin  which increased from percent in to percent in over that same period  net interest income increased percent to billion in from billion in growth in average interest earning assets and the addition of amsouth operations also contributed to the increase in net interest income

salaries and employee benefits increased percent to billion in compared to billion in  primarily due to the november addition of approximately  legacy amsouth associates  as well as normal annual compensation adjustments and higher incentive payouts 
excluding million of merger related charges in and million in  salaries and benefits increased percent in see table non interest expense including non gaap reconciliation for further details 
net occupancy expense increased percent to million in  primarily attributable to expenses added in connection with the amsouth acquisition  new and acquired branch offices and rising price levels 
furniture and equipment expense in totaled million  a percent increase over the prior year 
in addition to the higher merger related expense base  furniture and equipment associated with the addition of new branch offices was also a factor 
other non interest expense increased two percent to million in primarily due to a million increase in impairment of mortgage servicing rights  merger related costs of million and an increase in amortization of core deposit intangibles primarily related to intangibles added in the amsouth merger of million 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in legal and other professional fees and amortization of mortgage servicing rights
