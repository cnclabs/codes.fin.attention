item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand canterbury park holding corporation  our operations and our present business environment 
this md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements the notes 
strategic overview canterbury park holding corporation the company was incorporated under the laws of minnesota and acquired land and buildings to conduct pari mutuel horse racing operations the racetrack in march the racetrack is located in shakopee  minnesota  approximately miles southwest of downtown minneapolis 
in may  we commenced year round horse racing simulcast operations and hosted the first annual live race meet during the summer of our live racing operations are a seasonal business as we host live race meets each year from early may until labor day 
we earn additional pari mutuel revenue by televising our live racing to out of state racetracks around the country 
we also derive revenues from related services and activities  such as advertising  admissions  parking and publication sales and from other entertainment events and activities held at the racetrack 
in april  we opened canterbury park s card club the card club 
the card club operates hours a day  seven days a week and is limited by minnesota state law to a maximum of tables 
the card club currently offers tables of poker games and tables of casino games 
our three largest sources of revenues  card club operations  pari mutuel operations and concessions sales  generate cash revenues 
consequently  the company is highly liquid and has not utilized its line of credit in over five years 
financial performance summary net revenues operating expenses income before income tax expense income tax expense net income the primary strengths of canterbury park are our dedicated and capable staff  our first class facilities and acre property and the legal authority to offer our unique gaming products in our market area 
our management team has extensive knowledge of the horse racing and card businesses and our staff has demonstrated a commitment to our customers 
we continue to implement improvements to our comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement and enhancement program 
our management team has a good relationship with our workforce and is able to retain qualified personnel as demonstrated by our low turnover rate 
our facilities are modern by racetrack industry standards  and we have invested heavily in the past few years to update and upgrade them to meet the needs of our customers and horsemen 
our acre property with a prime location in one of the fastest growing counties in minnesota provides us with great long term growth and development opportunities 
our board of directors has begun the process of conducting research to determine the highest and best potential uses of our underutilized land 
our long term strategic direction is to enhance the character of our property as a unique gaming and entertainment destination 
we have a strong commitment to live racing and have been particularly successful in attracting new customers and providing a quality live racing experience for our horse racing fans as well as the horsemen who participate in the live racing at canterbury park 
the success of the card club has greatly enhanced our ability to offer a more competitive purse structure for live racing and has allowed us to make significant improvements to our grandstand and the backside stabling and training facilities 
as a result  we have been near capacity for horses stabled at canterbury park during our recent live race meets 
we have also increased live racing attendance during a time when the industry trend has generally been downward 
currently  we are the only facility offering live and simulcast racing in our market  although we do have competition in the simulcast market from internet horse racing sites 
while a number of tribal casinos located in minnesota operate the same unbanked card games offered at canterbury park  we are currently the only non tribal operator  and we have the only non tribal poker room operating within the seven county twin cities metropolitan area 
however  in january  the minnesota racing commission mrc granted a second license for the construction and operation of a harness racetrack in columbus township  anoka county  mn 
under current law  this licensee would be allowed to offer live and simulcast wagering only on harness races 
the harness racetrack is scheduled to begin live racing in mid april 
current law also permits the licensee to receive a license to host unbanked card games in a card room similar to the company s card club after it conducts a day live harness racing meet 
the harness racetrack has submitted their plan of operation and received approval from the mrc and expects to open their card room in july 
we continue to believe that our best option for long term growth is to gain authority under minnesota law to offer additional gaming options  which would enhance horse racing with increased purses  provide growth and development opportunities and produce significant new tax revenues for state and local governments 
the effort to obtain legislative authority for these initiatives has required  and will continue to require  substantial expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of legislative activities  there can be no assurance that any bills favorable to the company s interests will be enacted into law  and it is possible  as a result of the legislative process  that legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the company may be enacted into law 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets at december  we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows 
should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  we will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of these assets exists

contingencies in connection with the purchase of the racetrack  the company entered into an earn out promissory note dated march  in accordance with the earn out note  if i off track betting becomes legally permissible in the state of minnesota and ii we begin to conduct off track betting with respect to or in connection with its operations  we will be required to pay to the imr fund  lp the greater of  per operating year as defined  or of the net pretax profit as defined  for each of five operating years 
at this time  we believe that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met and that we will be required to pay these amounts is remote 
at the date if any that these two conditions are met  the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under the of net pretax profit calculation 
the first payment is to be made days after the end of the third operating year in which off track betting is conducted by us 
remaining payments would be made within days of the end of each of the next four operating years 
the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
at december   management believes that the resolution of any legal actions outstanding will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
operations review year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues total net operating revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  or  compared to total operating revenues of million for the year ended december  total card club revenues decreased  pari mutuel revenues decreased and concession revenues remained relatively unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal discussions of pari mutuel and card club revenues follow 
summary of pari mutuel operating data year ended year ended racing days simulcast only days live and simulcast days total racing days on track handle simulcast handle on non live race days simulcast handle on live race days total simulcast handle live racing handle total on track handle out of state live handle total handle on track average daily handle simulcast only days live and simulcast days pari mutuel revenues include commission and breakage revenues on live on track and simulcast racing  fees received from out of state racetracks for wagering on our live races and proceeds from uncashed winning tickets 
pari mutuel revenues decreased to million from million in  primarily reflecting a decrease in on track live racing and simulcast handle in compared to total handle wagered on simulcast races in decreased  or  compared to lower patron wagering can be partially attributed to growing competition from internet wagering considered to be illegal in the state of minnesota 
also  the general downturn in economic conditions during and the unfavorable legislation severely restricting smoking in all public places in minnesota  which became effective october   has resulted in lower handle 
on track live handle decreased by  or  for the live meet compared to the live meet in due partly to the fact that in  the company offered fewer races to achieve the desired purse structure 
also  in  canterbury park did not hold the claiming crown event  which resulted in less on track handle being recorded compared to the same weekend in in which the claiming crown was held 
wagering at out of state tracks on races conducted at the racetrack during the live meet increased  or  compared to the meet primarily due to increased wagering at certain out of state locations 
revenues recognized on proceeds from winning pari mutuel tickets which were not presented for payment within one year of the end of the respective race meets decreased approximately  in compared to  primarily due to reduced amounts wagered on simulcast horse races 
summary of card club revenues year ended year ended poker games casino games total collection revenue other revenue total card club revenue number of days offered average revenue per day the primary source of card club revenue is a percentage of the wagers received from the players as compensation for providing the card club facility and services  referred to as collection revenue 
other revenue presented above includes fees collected for the administration of tournaments and amounts earned as reimbursement for the administrative costs of maintaining the jackpot funds 
the card club is divided into two areas  the poker area and the casino games area 
the average daily collection amount per game is dependent upon the number of tables utilized to offer the game 
patron demand determines the number of tables to be used for a specific game 
since december  there have been a total of tables in the poker area and tables in the casino games area 
total card club revenue decreased  or  compared to the decrease in card club revenue is due primarily to the decrease in casino games revenue of  or  in over casino games revenue has decreased as a result of the unfavorable smoking legislation that went into effect on october  tribal casinos located in minnesota are not bound by this legislation and will continue to offer various gaming alternatives in an environment that allows smoking 
revenue in the poker room also decreased  or  in over primarily as a result of this legislation 
card club revenues represent and of net revenues for and  respectively 
we expect that competition from internet wagering and tribal casinos will continue to put pressure on card club operating revenues in future periods 
also  the company anticipates an unfavorable impact due to new competition in the card club and casino games industry with the opening of the harness racetrack 
as a result  we continue to search for opportunities to make canterbury park the most attractive alternative when our customers want to wager on card games 
concession revenues remained relatively stable in   compared to  in the company experienced an increase in admission and parking revenues due to fewer days of free admission being offered 
publication sales revenues slightly decreased due to the decrease in the amount of pari mutuel wagering 
other operating revenue decreased  or  to  in fiscal year compared to the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in the corporate sponsorships and advertising revenues of  a decrease in the gain on sale of assets of  and a decrease in cash services fees of  resulting from decreased patronage in the card club 
promotional allowances remained relatively stable year over year but increased as a percentage in total net revenues due to the addition of a player tracking system that allows the company to now offer promotional awards to players in the poker room in addition to those already being offered in the casino games room 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased approximately  or  to  in  from  in primarily due to decreases in statutory purses  salaries  wages and benefit costs  advertising and marketing and insurance 
see below for a detailed quantification of each of these items 
total operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to from in we experienced a decrease in pari mutuel and card club revenues in as a result  despite decreases in variable pari mutuel expenses  salaries and benefits  and purse expenses  operating expenses became a larger percentage of total revenues 
total purse expense decreased  or  in compared to as presented in the table below 
minnesota law requires us to allocate a portion of funds received from betting in the card club and wagering on simulcast and live horse races for future payment as purses for live horse races or other uses of minnesota s horsepersons associations 
purse expense relates to card club  simulcast  and live racing 
a description of how the purse expense is calculated for these three expenses is given below 
the decline in card club revenues in compared to resulted in the decreases in card club purse and mbf expense shown in the table below 
total purse expense associated with simulcast racing decreased in compared to due to lower wagering levels 
we experienced a decrease in live racing purse expense  which is attributable to lower on track wagering 
purse expense minnesota breeders fund expense card club simulcast racing live racing total while we are obligated by state law to pay up to of card club revenues to the purse fund and mbf  pursuant to an agreement with the mhbpa  we paid a total of of total card club revenues to these funds in and the amounts paid are allocated to the purse funds and to the mbf 
the amounts paid to the purse fund for simulcast racing differ depending upon whether the simulcast wagering occurs during the racing season  a statutorily defined week period beginning in early may each year  or outside of the racing season 
we paid an average of of handle to the purse fund in  compared to in we pay of pari mutuel simulcast commission revenues to the mbf  consequently  lower revenues result in lower mbf expense 
minnesota law generally provides that a minimum of of the on track live racing handle be paid to the purse fund 
the amount paid to the purse fund for wagers at out of state racetracks is of the net of fees collected less costs incurred to provide the uplink signal 
we pay of on track live handle to the mbf 
we also experienced a reduction in host fees of  or  in compared to due to lower wagering experienced in compared to salary and benefit expenses decreased by  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease in salaries and benefits expense is primarily attributable to a reduction in force initiative that was implemented during wages directly related to non full time employees decreased  due to general efforts to control labor costs in that area

in addition  as of december   we had million of capacity under a commercial revolving credit line as part of a general credit and security agreement with bremer bank 
in april  this agreement was renewed for an additional one year term 
we had no borrowings under the credit line in or our three largest sources of revenue  pari mutuel wagering  card club operations and concessions  are all based on cash transactions

we designate cash balances which will be required to satisfy certain short term liabilities such as progressive jackpots  the player pool and amounts due horsemen for purses and awards as restricted 
the company s casino games are required by law to be unbanked 
unbanked refers to a wagering system or game where wagers lost or won by the host are accumulated into a player pool liability for purposes of enhancing the total amount paid back to players in any other card game 
the company may only serve as custodian of the player pool 
it may not have an active interest in any card game and does not recognize net wins or losses as revenue 
the company is required to return accumulated player pool funds to the players through giveaways  promotional items  prizes or by other means 
the player pool liability was approximately  at december  compared to  at december  the card club offers progressive jackpots for poker games 
amounts collected for these jackpot funds are accrued as liabilities until paid to winners 
at december   accrued jackpot funds totaled approximately  compared to  at december  the mrc regulates the operation of the player pool and progressive jackpot pools 
these liabilities have the potential for significant fluctuation on a daily basis 
all games in the card club are played using chips 
the value of chips issued and outstanding  referred to as the outstanding chip liability  was approximately  at december   compared to  at december  this liability has the potential for significant fluctuation on a daily basis depending upon the demand for chip redemptions and sales
