overview tiens usa researches  develops  manufactures  and markets nutrition supplement products  including wellness products and dietary supplement products 
our operations are conducted from our headquarters in tianjin  china through our owned subsidiary  biological 
we sell our products to affiliated companies in china and internationally 
we develop our products at our product research and development center  which employs highly qualified professionals in the fields of pharmacology  biology  chemistry and fine chemistry 
we have developed and produce nutrition supplement products  which include wellness products and dietary nutrition supplements 
during  we phased out production of our personal care line of products  which had not been a material part of our business  to focus on our wellness products and dietary supplements 
in china  we sell our products to tianshi engineering  an affiliated company 
tianshi engineering  in turn  sells the products to customers through its branches and affiliated companies and at chain stores which are owned by individual distributors 
internationally  we sell our products to overseas affiliates who in turn sell to independent distributors who use the products themselves and or resell them to other distributors or consumers 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
in revenue was million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the breakdown of revenue between chinese and international sales is as follows 
chinese and international revenue revenue year year change china international in revenue from china decreased to million  or compared to million in  primarily due to a decrease in sales 
in order to qualify for a direct selling license in china  tianshi engineering  our related party customer in china  is required to produce a part of the products that it sells in china 
therefore  at the beginning of  we began selling semi finished products to tianshi engineering  which jointly shares with us licenses to produce  manufacture and sell the products 
these semi finished products have a lower sales price than the finished products we had previously sold to tianshi engineering 
during we still had a considerable inventory of finished products that we continued to sell to tianshi engineering 
as a result  during we were still selling some of the higher priced finished products 
in  substantially all of the products we sold to tianshi engineering were semi finished products 
in addition  in the third quarter of  tianshi engineering conducted a special promotion to stimulate sales in china 
no similar promotion was held in the application of tianshi engineering for a direct selling license in china is still pending 
until the application is approved  tianshi engineering will continue to sell our products through its branches  affiliated companies and chain stores in china 
in  international sales decreased by to million  compared to million in this mainly reflects a sharp decrease in sales to countries in africa during the second quarter of and a decrease in sales generally in other countries 
in addition  in august of  aqsiq announced an ongoing national campaign in china against unsafe food and substandard products 
the special campaign against poor product quality was launched in response to a series safety scares involving chinese products worldwide 
the campaign set detailed goals  including twelve percents 
for example  percent of food producers should be licensed  percent of agricultural wholesale markets in cities must be monitored  percent of suppliers of raw materials for exported products should be inspected  and percent of agricultural products must be free of five types of strong pesticides 
the campaign  which was originally scheduled to finish at the end of  is currently scheduled to continue throughout as a result of this campaign by the aqsiq  there has been a general slow down and backlog of export clearances for chinese food products  and we have experienced significant delays in obtaining export clearance for all of the products which we sell to our international affiliates 
however  to date  there have not been any specific problems identified with our products 
we believe that these delays have resulted in some of our international affiliates not being able to purchase sufficient quantities of our products to meet their demand and a corresponding decrease in our international revenues 
continued delays in the export clearance for our products may continue to result in us not being able to meet the demand for our products from our international affiliates 
cost of sales 
cost of sales were million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to the corresponding decrease in sales revenue 
cost of sales decreased at a lesser rate than revenue because the cost of raw materials increased during while our product prices remained unchanged 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million in  compared to million in the gross profit margin for was compared to in the semi finished products which we were selling in china during had a lower profit margin than the finished products which we were selling in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  consulting expenses  insurance costs  and depreciation expenses 
the selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in other income  net 
other income  net was million of income in  compared to income of million in other income mainly includes interest income 
on january   the million loan to tianshi engineering became interest bearing

as a result  in  we began to sell semi finished products to tianshi engineering  which jointly shares with us licenses to produce  manufacture and sell the products 
these semi finished products have a lower sales price than the finished products we had previously sold to tianshi engineering 
in addition  we believe that sales to china in were negatively impacted by other factors  including continued consumer uncertainty in china regarding the impact of direct selling regulations and uncertainty regarding the timing of the direct selling license application process and approval  and increased government and media scrutiny on the direct selling industry  particularly following publication of new direct selling regulations at the end of in  international sales increased to million  or compared to million in the strong growth reflected a significant increase in demand for our products in indonesia  as well as strong revenue growth in kazakhstan  south africa  thailand  ukraine  congo and ghana 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million in  a increase compared with cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to for in order to improve the quality of our products  during we introduced some new manufacturing procedures and stricter quality control testing than previously  which added to our manufacturing costs 
in addition  due to the uncertainty of the chinese market  we did not achieve domestic sales growth and the average fixed cost per unit was higher than in gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million in  compared to million in the gross profit margin for was compared to in as a result of the reasons discussed under cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  or compared to million in this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in transportation expenses  as well as a decrease in low cost supplies expenses and expenses relating to the startup costs of tiens yihai 
in we began to sell semi finished goods to tianshi engineering and the transportation costs that were previously incurred by us are now incurred by tianshi engineering 
the selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was million of income in  compared to expense of million in the increase was a result of improved cash management  including the purchase of an investment product and deposits in higher interest bearing accounts

on june   we entered into a written lease agreement with tianshi group to pay annual rent at of our total gross revenues 
this agreement expired on december  we have entered into a new on year lease agreement with tianshi group  effective january   with the same terms 
because the rent is based upon a percentage of our gross total revenues  we are not able to include a fixed figure in the table relating to this obligation 
the total amount paid in under this lease was  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including funding for expansion of operations  through net cash flow provided by operating activities 
our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the decrease primarily reflects the decrease in net income and the fact that  during  tianshi engineering did not pay us cash for products it purchased from us  but offset such amounts from other liabilities we owed tianshi engineering and other affiliates 
as of december   we had positive working capital of million 
cash was million as of december   compared to as of december  net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in we made a million loan to tianshi engineering 
that loan was paid off on december  by canceling an equal amount of the consideration due to tianshi investment for the acquisition of life resources 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to million for in biological paid a million dividend to its minority shareholder 
accounts receivable related parties increased slightly to million as of december  from million as of december  other receivable related parties increased to million as of december  from million as of december  historically  tianshi engineering remitted payment to us upon sales to third party customers 
however  to support tianshi engineering s marketing efforts in anticipation of receiving a direct selling license in china  we agreed to allow tianshi engineering to defer payment to us 
beginning in january  accounts receivable relating to tianshi engineering older than days are transferred to other receivables related parties and become interest bearing 
going forward  our primary requirements for cash consist of construction by life resources of new research and development  manufacturing and logistic facilities  and administrative offices  the continued production of existing products and general overhead and personnel related expenses to support these activities  the development costs of new products  and expansion of production scale to meet the demands of our markets 
we estimate that the completion of the life resources project will require approximately million  including the million already spent to acquire all of the registered share capital of life resources 
we intend to construct the facilities in phases over several years  based on available cash and capacity needs 
depending on the rate of construction and our cash flow  we may require additional financing to complete the funding of that project 
we anticipate that our current operating activities will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements for management assumptions management anticipates  based on internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our current operations that existing cash and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital for at least the next months 
in the event that our business plans change  our assumptions change or prove inaccurate or if other capital resources and projected cash flow otherwise prove to be insufficient to fund operations due to unanticipated expense  technical difficulties  or otherwise  we could be required to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition during  the company sold both semi finished products and finished products to tianshi engineering domestically 
revenue from semi finished products was recognized at fob tianjin shipping point 
revenue from finished products was recognized only when the related party chinese distributors recognized sales of the company s products to unaffiliated third parties 
revenues in both cases are net of taxes 
for overseas sales  the company only sells finished products 
the company recognizes revenue from international sales non chinese to both affiliated and unaffiliated third parties  net of taxes as goods are shipped and clear review by the customs department of the chinese government 
the company is generally not contractually obligated to accept returns 
however  on a case by case negotiated basis  the company permits customers to return their products 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
such reserves are based upon management s evaluation of historical experience and estimated costs 
the amount of the reserves ultimately required could differ materially in the near term from amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   tianshi engineering  an affiliated company  owned all of the related party distributors which sell our products in china 
allowance for doubtful accounts our trade accounts receivables are mainly due from related companies 
we have a general allowance for doubtful debts of of the year end balance of accounts receivable related parties 
management reviews its accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year end  paying particular attention to the age of receivable outstanding 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the moving average basis 
management reviews inventory annually for possible obsolete goods or to determine if any reserves are necessary for potential obsolescence

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effects of inflation we are subject to commodity price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the various raw materials that comprise our products 
price risks are managed by each business unit through productivity improvements and cost containment measures 
for the time being  the management does not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our operating subsidiary  biological  is located in china  and buys all of its raw materials in china and sells our products in china using the renminbi as the functional currency 
based on chinese government regulations  all foreign currencies under the category of current accounts are allowed to be freely exchanged with hard currencies 
as of december   the exchange rate was rmb  compared to rmb as of december  substantially all our revenues and expenses are denominated in the renminbi 
however  we use the dollar for financial reporting purposes 
the value of renminbi against the dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
as our operations are primarily in china  any significant revaluation of the renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows  revenues and financial condition 
for example  to the extent that we need to convert dollars into renminbi for our operations  appreciation of this currency against the dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
conversely  if we decide to convert our renminbi into dollars for other business purposes and the dollar appreciates against this currency  the dollar equivalent of the renminbi would be reduced 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
currently we have not entered agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks  although we may do so in the future
