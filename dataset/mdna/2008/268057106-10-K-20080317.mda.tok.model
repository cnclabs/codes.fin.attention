item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dynamics research corporation  headquartered in andover  massachusetts  is a leading  innovative provider of solutions and services to federal  state and local governments 
we provide support to our customers in the primary mission areas of it  logistics and readiness  systems integration and technical services  cisr  homeland security  health and human services  and intelligence space 
according to input  inc a leading research firm specializing in the market for government contractors  federal market demand for vendor furnished information systems and services is estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of over the next years 
the president of the us s proposed budget for fiscal reflects a increase in expenditures for it services 
we are cognizant of funding challenges facing the federal government and the resulting increase in competitiveness in our industry 
significant contract awards have been and will continue to be delayed and new initiatives have been slow to start 
there appears to be recent improvement in contract award and funding decisions with the passage of federal budgets for fiscal year for the dod and dhs 
however  contract award and funding decisions for the federal civilian agencies have been delayed  as these departments are currently operating under a continuing resolution for fiscal year customers are moving away from gsa and time and materials contracts toward agency sponsored id iq contract vehicles and fixed price contracts and task orders 
the dod seeks to reduce spending on contracted program advisory and assistance services and often is setting this work aside for small businesses 
concurrently  there is increasing demand from federal customers for engineering  training  business transformation  lean six sigma and business intelligence solutions and services 
many federal customers are seeking to streamline their procurement activities by consolidating work under large contract vehicles 
our competitive strategy is intended to align with these trends 
we have two reportable business segments systems and services  and metrigraphics 
the systems and services segment accounted for approximately of total revenue and the metrigraphics segment accounted for approximately of total revenue in critical accounting policies there are business risks specific to the industries in which we operate 
these risks include estimates of costs to complete contract obligations  changes in government policies and procedures  government contracting issues and risks associated with technological development 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions and changes in business strategy or market conditions may significantly impact our assets or liabilities  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments made and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our systems and services business segment provides services pursuant to time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which would directly affect operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of some costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have not had a material impact on our revenue and operating income 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the risk on a fixed price contract is estimates of costs to complete the contract may exceed revenues on the contract 
for all types of contracts  we recognize anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in contract revenue and cost of contract revenue 
unbilled receivables are the amounts of recoverable contract revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
unbilled receivables relate principally to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings  or delayed for other reasons 
costs related to certain us government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts we expect to realize upon final settlement 
our metrigraphics business segment records revenue from product sales upon transfer of both title and risk of loss to the customer  provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
product sales are recorded net of sales taxes and net of returns upon delivery 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling is classified as product sales 
the cost of shipping products to the customer is recognized at the time the products are shipped and are recorded as cost of product sales 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of impact innovations in and other businesses in  we acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among other things  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant and reviews of projected cash flows 
as a result of the annual impairment test performed as of december   we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  did not record a charge for impairment 
however  we are unable to assure that goodwill will not be impaired in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million in the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and deferred taxes on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from these positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as part of our process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefits from deferred taxes 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability and assessing temporary and permanent differences 
table of contents resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we had a net deferred liability of million at december  we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent a recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance was not required 
pension obligations accounting and reporting for our pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including the discount rate and expected rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are used by independent actuaries to determine the value of our pension obligations and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is determined by a spot rate yield curve method 
the spot rate yield curve is employed to match the plan assets cash outflows with the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments 
as of the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations was and the net periodic benefit costs was 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would result in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million in the assumed expected rate of return on plan assets  which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants  is determined by an annual review of historical plan asset returns and consultation with outside investment advisors 
as of the pension plan s measurement date  the weighted average expected rate of return was 
a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return would result in an increase in annual pension expense by approximately million in if assumptions differ materially from actual results in the future  our obligations under the pension plan could also differ materially  potentially requiring us to record an additional pension liability and record additional pension costs 
an actuarial valuation of the pension plan is performed each year 
the results of this actuarial valuation are reflected in the accounting for the pension plan upon determination 
at december   we recorded a pension asset of million in the consolidated balance sheets that represented the overfunded benefit obligation 
results of operations operating results in millions and results expressed as a percentage of total revenues are as follows year ended december  contract revenue product sales total revenue gross profit on contract revenue gross profit on product sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating income interest expense  net other income  net provision for income taxes cumulative benefit of accounting change  net of tax net income totals may not add due to rounding 
the percentage for provision for income taxes relate to a percentage of income before provision for income taxes 
these amounts represent a percentage of contract revenues  product sales and total revenues  respectively 

table of contents revenue we reported total revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
total revenue decreased by in compared to and in compared to resulting in both comparable periods from a decline in contract revenue 
beginning in august  our work for the asc transitioned to a new contract vehicle  the caps contract 
under the caps contract work performed by other contractor team members on these programs  which under the predecessor contract was passed through our revenue and cost of sales at a very low profit margin  was contracted directly between the joint venture and the subcontractor and no longer was included in our financial results 
revenues for compared with decreased approximately million as a result of this transition 
the completion of our contract with the air national guard in may also reduced revenues when compared with by approximately million 
excluding the effects of the caps contract transition and completion of the air national guard contract  the growth in revenue for was 
contract revenues contract revenues in our systems and services segment were earned from the following sectors in millions year ended december  national defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state and local government agencies other total contract revenue totals may not add due to rounding 
the decrease in revenues from national defense and intelligence agencies in compared to was due to the transition into the new caps contract in august and the loss of the air national guard guard contract in may  partially offset by increased revenues from the naval air system command airspeed sub contract awarded in march absent the effects of the caps contract transition and completion of the air national guard contract  contract revenue for grew 
the decrease in revenues from national defense and intelligence agencies in compared to was due to curtailment of work with the guard  reduced work with the us air force electronic systems center and the loss of the office of assistant secretary of defense for public affairs work in october in july  the joint venture was notified that the us air force contracting officer for the caps contract had made a determination that it would no longer be eligible to bid on further contract task orders 
in the period from july through december  we were unable to effectively re compete for and retain three task orders with annual revenue of approximately million 
as a result  the million of revenues recognized on these task orders in will not recur in in january  we purchased from the centech group  inc a prime caps contract  on which minimal work was being performed 
this purchase now enables us to respond to government solicitations under the caps contract 
we are awaiting us air force approval of the contract novation 
the increase in revenues from federal civilian agencies in compared to was primarily due to added revenues from the fdic contract awarded in november the decrease in revenues from federal civilian agencies in compared to was due to the loss of subcontracted revenues with the internal revenue service irs 
the decrease in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues from our contract with the state of ohio  under which a significant portion of the work has been completed  partially offset by higher revenues from our state of colorado contract awarded in april the decrease in revenues from state and local government agencies in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues under our contract with the state of ohio 
we anticipate our revenues with the state of ohio will be consistent with levels as a result of anticipated extensions and expansions of the contract 
in february  we were selected by the state of tennessee to develop and implement a statewide child welfare system similar to the ohio project 
we anticipate revenues with the state of tennessee in the vicinity of million in as a result  we anticipate our revenues in the market sector will grow in 
table of contents revenues by contract type as a percentage of systems and services segment revenues were as follows year ended december  time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price  including service type contracts prime contract sub contract prime contract revenues decreased in compared with as a result of the transition to the caps contract held by the joint venture 
we have classified our revenues derived through the joint venture as sub contract revenue 
product sales product sales for the metrigraphics segment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue from product sales for the metrigraphics segment in compared to primarily was due to a decrease in medical device sales 
in october  metrigraphics was approved to begin production to a new medical device customer 
shipments began in the fourth quarter of and as a result we are anticipating an increase in metrigraphics revenue in compared with funded backlog our funded backlog was million at december   million at december  and million at december  we expect that substantially all of our backlog at december  will generate revenue during the year ending december  gross profit total gross profit was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of  and for  and  respectively 
our gross profit on contract revenue was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for compared with was a result of an increase in billable labor and lower indirect costs 
the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to the reduction in low margin subcontractor revenues resulting from the transition to the new caps contract in august as noted above 
the decline in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue and increases in indirect costs including costs related to a reduction in workforce  an increase in business development efforts  share based compensation and changes in revenue mix 
unusually high severance costs of million were recorded in cost of contract revenue in compared to million in and million in in  we implemented facilities consolidation actions which will lower costs by an estimated million 
our gross profit loss on product sales was million  million and million resulting in a gross margin of  and for  and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit in both comparable periods was primarily attributable to a lower level of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was a result of cost savings initiatives undertaken in the first half of  which also included higher severance costs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily the result of lower costs for salaries and benefits resulting from the workforce reductions  as well as other cost reduction efforts 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expenses which were million in  million in and million in 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization expense  which relates to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
amortization expense for fiscal is anticipated at approximately million 
operating income our operating income was million  or of revenue  in  million  or of revenue in and million  or of revenue in the increase in the operating margin in was primarily due to a favorable increase in total gross margin and lower indirect costs which resulted from a variety of cost savings initiatives undertaken in the decline in operating margin in was primarily due to indirect overhead costs  employee benefit costs and general and administrative expenses decreasing at a slower rate than revenues 
interest expense  net we incurred interest expense totaling million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in both comparable periods was due to a lower outstanding debt balance  partially offset by a higher average interest rate 
the weighted average interest rates on our outstanding borrowings were   and at december   and  respectively 
we recorded approximately million of interest income in each of the three years ended other income  net we recorded million of net other income in both and and million in in and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of realized gains resulting from the sale of shares of common shares of lucent technologies  inc during those periods 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  other income includes recognition of our portion of income or loss related to our equity investments 
we recorded income related to our equity investments of million in and million in each of the two years ended approximately million in both and and million in were included in other income attributable to gains on our deferred compensation plan investments 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income tax provision was recorded at rates of in  in  and in these rates reflect the statutory federal rate of in both and and in the tax rate reflects the implementation of fin and a favorable current state blended rate compared to previous years 
the tax rate reflects the implementation of sfas r for certain stock awards and the relative impact of permanent difference due to a lower profit before tax balance and an increase in tax rates applied to deferred income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by favorable state income tax audits and tax credits and adjustment of tax accruals and reserves 
shares used in computing earnings per share weighted average common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in shares in both comparable periods was related to additional shares issued  partially offset by a decreased dilutive effect on employee stock options due to a lower average annual stock price 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating  investing and financing activities as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
at december   the borrowing capacity available under our revolver was million 
our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are subject to trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  economic conditions  government payment practices and contractual matters 
our need for access to funds is dependent on future operating results  our growth and acquisition activity and external conditions 
we believe that selective acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy 
we may acquire  from time to time  firms or properties that are aligned with our core capabilities and which complement our customer base 
we will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that align with our strategic objectives  along with the possibility of utilizing the credit facility as a source of financing 

table of contents based upon our present business plan and operating performance  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  combined with amounts available for borrowing under the revolver  will be adequate to fund the capital requirements of our existing operations during and for the foreseeable future 
in the event that our current capital resources are not sufficient to fund requirements  we believe our access to additional capital resources would be sufficient to meet our needs 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million and million  respectively 
our operating practice is to apply cash received against outstanding revolving credit facility balances 
as a result  cash balances at the end of the year generally reflect the timing and size of cash receipts at the end of the year 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million during was primarily attributable to an increase in income 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million in and  respectively 
contract receivables were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
billed receivables increased million in and decreased million in  while unbilled receivables decreased million and million in and  respectively 
contract receivables days sales outstanding  or dso  were days at december  and days at december  at december  and  the unbilled receivables balance included million and million  respectively  related to our contract with the state of ohio 
under the current terms of the contract  the amount is anticipated to be invoiced and collected in accordance with completion of contract milestones 
our net deferred tax liability was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in deferred taxes was principally due to deferred taxes on unbilled receivables which declined to million at december  from million at december   partially offset by a change in deferred taxes associated with the defined benefit plan 
we paid million in income taxes in compared to million in the irs continues to challenge the deferral of income for tax purposes related to our unbilled receivables including the applicability of a letter ruling issued by the irs to us in january which granted to us deferred tax treatment of our unbilled receivables 
this issue has been elevated to the irs national office for determination 
while the outcome of the audit of the income tax return is not expected to be known for several months and remains uncertain  we may incur interest expense  our deferred tax liabilities may be reduced and income tax payments may be increased substantially in future periods 
share based compensation decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to the amendment to our employee stock purchase plan during the fourth quarter of which resulted in the espp being treated as non compensatory  as more fully described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
the increase in is due to our adoption of sfas r beginning january  as of december  the total unrecognized compensation related to restricted stock awards was million to be recognized over years  and the total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was million  which is expected to be recognized over five months 
non cash amortization expense of our acquired intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that non cash expense for the amortization of intangible assets will decrease to approximately million in our defined benefit pension plan was overfunded by million in and underfunded by million in the improvement in the plan s funded status was primarily attributable to the change in the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations during to from in during  we recorded pension income of million compared to pension expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in pension costs in both comparable periods was due to actions approved by the board of directors to amend the pension plan during the fourth quarter of  which removed the annual benefit inflator for active participants in the plan as of december  during  contributions of million were made to fund our pension plan 
no employer contributions were made in we currently anticipate making a million contribution in investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million during was primarily attributable to capital expenditures and payments under the sale and leaseback transaction for our headquarters facility referenced below 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and net cash used in investing activities was million in 
table of contents capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
for all years  capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of software  other equipment and leasehold improvements  other than for the andover facility renovation 
expenditures for the andover facility renovation were million in we expect capital expenditures in to be at similar levels as during  we made improvements to our headquarters facility of million in connection with our obligation under the sale and leaseback transaction entered into in we have substantially made all required improvements under the agreement and expect the letter of credit to be released in the first quarter of during and  we sold our lucent shares for million and million  respectively  realizing a gain on the sale of million and million  respectively 
on december   we sold our headquarters facility in andover  massachusetts and entered into a lease for the same property for a ten year term with two five year renewal options 
proceeds realized from the sale were million resulting in a gain of million that will be recognized over the ten year term of the lease 
in both and  we amortized million of the deferred gain 
we anticipate a similar benefit in subsequent periods through the end of the lease 
financing activities during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented net repayments under our credit facility of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
our revolving credit facility the credit facility provides for a million  three year revolving credit agreement the revolver for working capital needs  which expires in september on an ongoing basis  the credit facility requires us to meet financial covenants  including maintaining a minimum net worth and certain cash flow and debt coverage ratios 
the covenants also limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  purchase capital assets  sell or dispose of assets  make additional acquisitions or investments  or enter into new leases  among other restrictions 
in addition  the credit facility provides that the bank group may accelerate payment of all unpaid principal and all accrued and unpaid interest under the credit facility  upon the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
additional information related to the credit facility is referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
the average daily borrowing on our revolver for was million at a weighted average interest rate of  compared to an average daily borrowing of million at a weighted average interest rate of in and an average daily borrowing of million at a weighted average interest rate of in under our then existing revolver during those periods 
also  during and  our average daily outstanding balance under our then existing term and acquisition term loans was million at a weighted average interest rate of and million at a weighted average interest rate of  respectively 
during  net cash used in financing activities of million represented principal payments under the acquisition term loan of million  partially offset by million of net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
the outstanding balances on our previous credit facility  which consisted of an acquisition term loan balance of million and a revolving credit facility balance of million  were paid off and re borrowed under the revolver as part of the credit facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility which has been classified as long term as amounts borrowed under the revolver are contractually due on the maturity of the credit facility  however we may repay at any time prior to that date 
during  net cash used in financing activities was million  which consisted of million of repayments under the acquisition term loan  million of repayments under the revolver and million of repayments under the term loan  partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not utilize or employ any off balance sheet arrangements during the three years ended december   defined as i an obligation under a guarantee contract  ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement  iii an obligation  including a contingent obligation  under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or iv an obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  consist of the following in millions payments due by period less than two to four to total one year three years five years thereafter long term debt operating leases letter of credit total contractual obligations the contractual amounts above related to long term debt do not include interest payments on our revolver s outstanding principal balance  because the interest rates are not fixed 
the repayment of borrowings under the revolver is contractually due on september   the maturity of the credit facility  however  we may repay at any time prior to that date 
the contractual amounts above related to operating leases do not include the effect of sublease rentals 
the amount of sublease rentals is disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k we have an outstanding letter of credit aggregating million at december  related to the sale and leaseback of our headquarters in andover  massachusetts  in the agreement provided that we pay for some improvements by the end of the third lease year 
at december   the improvements were substantially completed  however the letter of credit is required to be maintained until days after the completion of the improvements 
the letter of credit is expected to be released in the first quarter of we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of million as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
contingencies we are a party to litigation and other proceedings as referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
except as noted therein we do not presently believe it is reasonably likely that any of these matters would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our evaluation of the likelihood of expenditures related to these matters is subject to change in future periods  depending on then current events and circumstances  which could have material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements a description of recent accounting pronouncements are referenced in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item on this form k 
impact of inflation and changing prices overall  inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
additionally  the terms of dod contracts  which accounted for approximately of total revenue in  are generally one year contracts and include salary increase factors for future years  reducing the potential impact of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our revolver  where interest payments are tied to either the libor or prime rate 
the weighted average interest rate at december  on million of outstanding borrowings under the revolver was 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest expense as reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our potential loss over one year that would result in a hypothetical and instantaneous increase of one full percentage point in the interest rate on our revolver would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in addition  historically our investment positions have been relatively small and short term in nature 
we typically invest excess cash in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less and  accordingly  no exposure to market interest rates 
we have no significant exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign sales  which are nominal  are primarily denominated in us dollars
