critical accounting policies general our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when their occurrence is probable and estimable and ii sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
we evaluate non performing loans individually for impairment  such as nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management as required by sfas no 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of the impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  we make estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon historical loss rates for each loan type  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimates of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans including borrower or industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending staff  and national and local economic conditions 
the amounts of estimated losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment and groups of loans are added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
the estimate of losses is compared to our allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
such adjustments would be made in the relevant period and may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
executive overview net income for the year ended december was million or a increase over million for the year ended december three factors in contributed to this increase increased net interest income of  increased noninterest income of and controlled noninterest expense growth of 
we grew our loans by in  despite weaker than desired deposit growth  we were rewarded by growth in all the major categories of noninterest income deposit fees  credit and debit card fees  retail investment fees and mortgage company income 
equally important with the income gains was the minimal increase in expenses which reflected the full impact of the consolidation of three banks to one and management s control of expense increases 
this latter point is highlighted by the continued growth of the company s footprint 
during  we relocated our deltaville branch to a larger and more convenient location  opened our first branch in new kent county  virginia and prepared for a relocation of our leased mechanicsville office to a renovated county landmark  the windmill  in january our reward checking product  a unique in virginia interest checking product at its inception in  increased net product balances by meeting our goal of retaining existing customers and bringing in new customers 
in a year in which borrowings continued the trend of growing rapidly  reward checking was the only deposit category besides certificates to grow in while borrowings did grow in  the need to borrow was delayed by the million we received from our stock issuance in december the results of position us to continue to grow in and in future years 
as announced in december  the expected purchase of two millennium bank branches in march  should add to the our over all profitability in the impact of the increased number of shares from the stock issuance and the higher amount of capital revealed itself in the ratios for for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share on a basic and a diluted basis  flat compared to in return on average assets roa for was compared to in the prior year  and return on average equity roe was for compared to in core earnings during the period from to continued to improve as net interest income increased and noninterest income excluding realized gains on securities increased from the prior year 
management s control of noninterest expense in increased net income by growing only thousand compared to an increase of thousand in the small percentage increase in noninterest expense continues a trend over the last four years in which we have moved from a high of in  to in  to in to in while this trend may not continue in  it does show management s strong emphasis on controlling expense growth 
management s goal of growing income annually by is primarily dependent on growth of our existing markets and positioning the company to grow in new markets 
this strategy is emphasized by the progression over the last five years 
in  we purchased three branches from first virginia bank in a new market  southeastern virginia 
these are on or just off the route corridor from petersburg to virginia beach which gives us access to growth areas at both ends and in between 
in late  we opened a branch at central garage along the route corridor from richmond to tappahannock 
this is an area of high residential growth and with the influx of new residents  growth of businesses supporting the new residents 
in  we opened a branch in glenns  virginia on the route corridor between tappahannock and gloucester 
this is a market in which we look for future growth along route and across route from west point 
we also utilize parts of that building for training and accounting functions 
in december  our smallest branch airpark in hanover county was relocated to a larger office on a more accessible route in one of the fastest growing markets in hanover county 
this new kings charter office has two commercial loan officers and a large lobby  as well as accessible drive up windows which allows us to service our deposit customers while having better access to the business customers in the large business area in the vicinity 
in  we opened a new branch in new kent county where we had operated with a loan production officer for a year and a half before opening the branch 
the lender was able to generate a reasonable portfolio to help support opening a grass roots branch 
the year opens with relocation of our village branch to a new more visible and accessible branch at the windmill and our announcement of the purchase of branches in henrico county and colonial heights which brings us to new markets 
with the economic growth up and down the interstate corridor from northern virginia to emporia and the growth in the hampton roads area up the interstate and route corridor  we see many opportunities to expand our footprint in the existing corridors and new markets 
increased loan volume in and and the associated increased net interest income reflect our recognition that growth will fuel future earnings 
in addition  the overall asset quality of the loan portfolio continues near its highest level in our history 
in net interest margin continued to decrease as interest income from loan growth was offset by higher cost deposits and borrowings 
with the rate cuts by the federal reserve in  the surprise cut of basis points in mid january and the continuing questions about the long term impacts of the subprime lending melt down  we see a turbulent market in we are coming out of an economic environment for and most of which had high rates and caused slow deposit growth and forced us  like many other banks  to look at more expensive funding sources to fund loan demand 
the market that we are moving into for is one of rapid interest rate cuts by the federal reserve which is making the matching of loans and deposits repricing a challenge 
the company was pleased by the contributions of our noninterest income businesses in brokerage and mortgages 
these businesses added to the growth of noninterest income through their fees while having minimal operating expense impact 
in addition  deposit fee income continues to grow with the growth of our deposit base 
other ancillary products  such as debit card and atm fees  contributed a large part of the noninterest income increase in results of operations the table below lists our quarterly performance for the years ended december  and summary of financial results by quarter dollars in thousands dec

interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before applicable income taxes applicable income taxes net income net income per share  basic and diluted net interest income net interest income represents our gross profit margin and is defined as the difference between interest income and interest expense 
for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax exempt securities income is further adjusted by the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
by making these adjustments tax exempt income and their yields are presented on a comparable basis with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents our net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

nonaccrual loans have been included in the computations of average loan balances 
large dollar certificates of deposit are certificates issued in amounts of  or greater 
interest rate spread is the average yield on earning assets  calculated on a fully taxable basis  less the average rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the net interest income  calculated on a fully taxable basis assuming a federal income tax rate of  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
tax equivalent net interest income increased to million in from million in average earning asset growth of produced million of increased interest income  while interest bearing liabilities grew producing a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from higher loan volume offset in part by higher certificate and borrowings volumes as a result of a tight and competitive interest rate market that has predominated the last two years 
total average earning assets increased by million  or  with growth in loans of million  in investments of million and in federal funds sold of million 
total average liabilities grew million  or  while the interest bearing liabilities component increased million  or 
average interest bearing deposits for were up as consumers continued transferring money out of savings and money market accounts into higher yielding instruments 
regular certificates of deposit were up million and large dollar certificates were up million 
interest checking grew million from the reward checking product 
savings accounts were down million or and money market accounts were down million  or 
to offset the continued slow deposit growth and fund the loan growth  we used federal home loan bank borrowings at rates lower than certificates of deposit rates and in the early part of the year we used the excess cash from our december stock issuance 
this resulted in an increase in average borrowings of million  or during the general trend in was a slowing of the growth in borrowings  a slight increase in deposit growth with most of this occurring in the later part of the year with the consumer s flight to safe investments  and an interest environment that became more unclear as the year went on 
the combination of rate decreases by the federal reserve and the economic turmoil brought on by the subprime lending fiasco has created a shaky market which is very prone to psychological reaction of the masses as opposed to realistic analysis 
the rate change mirrored only on a smaller scale 
the increased cost of deposits and borrowings seen in the yield rate column in the table above more than offset the increase from rates in the earning assets 
the yield on earning assets increased basis points to in  after increasing basis points to in the earning asset increases were offset by interest bearing liabilities increases of basis points in to and of basis points in to 
these swings in rates negatively impacted the interest margin and spread 
net interest margin for was compared to for  a basis point decrease compared to the basis point decrease in net interest spread decreased basis points in to from in further emphasizing the continued narrowing of the gap between our earning assets income and our funding cost 
demand deposits were flat in  as they decreased slightly  less than 
the year will be another challenging year in margin management as we work to balance asset repricing that occurs sooner than deposit repricing in a lower interest rate environment 
in a normal slow rate decline that we have had in many business cycles in the past  this process would be relatively straight forward but in a world wide economic downturn that has surfaced at the end of and beginning of  we are more challenged 
while community banks like us for the most part have not been involved in subprime lending  we are exposed to a broad market reaction to the financial services industry which has lowered stock prices and presented some shaky financial scenarios to the larger institutions that took part in the loans or utilized hedge funds relying on these loans 
while we will not have the huge write offs that these other institutions are having  the economic environment that has been created may influence the ability of some of our customers to repay their loans 
the fast downward movement of interest rates is also influencing our investment portfolio which is a major source of offsetting the rate changes in loans 
the drop in rates is causing bonds to be called faster than normal and demanding management s attention to maintain the yield on the portfolio 
until rates stabilize in a more normal trend  we will operate in an environment that will probably negatively influence our earnings in the short term 
in  average earning asset growth of resulted from an increase in average loans outstanding of  average federal funds sold increased and average securities declined 
growth in average earning assets of million was primarily funded by average deposit growth of million and an increase in average borrowings of million 
in  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million from million in average earning asset growth of was the primary factor in the increase in net interest income and in producing a net interest margin of  down from in the volume and rate analysis table that follows reflects changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average volume and average rates

interest sensitivity our primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the fixed rate average maturity of asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
we generally strive to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
the banking industry traditionally faces funding challenges in an environment like we had through most of where the yield curve was flat or inverted 
managing the interest rate gap in an environment where rates have fallen so quickly presents management with different challenges 
depositors are uncertain about where to put their money  especially with the threat of an economic recession in the future 
we anticipate more funds coming to us as customers look for safer investments but that will take time 
currently  we have almost a third of our loan portfolio repricing almost instantly with each rate cut 
however  our deposits  especially certificates  do not reprice until they mature which results in a short term narrowing of earnings 
we saw clear evidence of this in late when our daily interest income dropped approximately one thousand dollars per day with each basis point change 
in a day horizon the balance sheet is asset sensitive  but we are slightly liability sensitive in a one year time frame 
this means we have a large number of deposits repricing later in the next year and will have to look for lower cost funding in the short term to support asset growth 
noninterest income noninterest income increased by thousand or to million in compared to million in service charges on deposit accounts  the largest source of noninterest income  increased by thousand or from million in to million in debit card and atm fee income increased thousand or from thousand in to thousand in investment services income increased to thousand 
other operating income increased or thousand to million compared to million in service charges benefited from increased fees based on both rate and volume increases 
debit and atm activity fees were influenced by higher volume and more interchange fees on debit cards 
investment services income benefited from higher service volume 
other income was impacted by a thousand increase in evb mortgage  inc income  thousand increase in bank owned life insurance income and a thousand increase in title company income 
realized gain on sale of securities decreased thousand from thousand to thousand in we had no gains or losses from other real estate 
noninterest income increased thousand or from to  attributable to a thousand increase in service charges on deposits  a thousand increase in debit card and atm fee income and a thousand increase in investment services income 
other operating income increased from million in to million in which was the result of increases in mortgage business income and reasonable increases in other income categories

brokerage commissions ebb and flow with the profitability of the business 
in the other major personnel categories  taxes and insurance expense increased thousand and other benefits increased thousand 
net occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand or to million for  from million in occupancy expense increased thousand or  as most expenses in this category increased as a result of posting a full year of depreciation for one branch  rent for two others and the increase in the associated ancillary costs that go with this growth 
building repairs and maintenance was up due to nondepreciable improvements in old branches 
equipment expense rose due to depreciation on a new mainframe  increased cost for software maintenance and core it service contracts 
as we continue to expand  we anticipate these expenses increasing as a normal cost of business 
the purchase of the millennium branches in will increase all the costs associated with buildings and their upkeep 
in  other operating expenses decreased in total thousand or to million compared to million in this decrease resulted from declines in consulting expenses of thousand  data processing of thousand and marketing and advertising of thousand 
consulting fees dropped as all the consulting cost from the one bank reorganization was paid and management managed new consulting fees in the data processing change was the result of continued segmenting of expenses in our chart of accounts and managing the better defined costs 
marketing and advertising expense decreased as a result of less advertising related to the new bank name and the introduction of a new product  reward checking 
other operating expenses increased thousand mostly from a thousand increase in miscellaneous loan expense related to higher oreo and collection expenses  continued increases in heloc costs as we continued to grow that loan category and higher credit card expenses 
in addition  education and training expense rose as the company increased its effort to keep the directors and employees up to date on issues and procedures 
with the continued expansion that we expect in the future  these expenses will increase to mirror our growth efforts 
for  total noninterest expense increased thousand or in compared to an increase of million or in in total dollars  noninterest expense was million in compared to million in salaries and benefits with a thousand increase was the largest contributor to the increase 
on a year to year basis  salaries and benefits increased to million in compared to million in net occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand or to million for  from million in there were no major initiatives for most of the year  so increases were associated with annual contract or rent increases 
in december  the old airpark branch was relocated to the kings charter branch 
other operating expenses increased thousand or to million in from million in this increase was influenced by decreases in consulting fees of thousand and data processing of thousand  offset by increases in marketing and advertising expense of thousand and other operating expense of thousand 
consulting and data processing expense declined 
marketing and advertising expense increased as the result of two major efforts the re branding of the company under the evb name and the introduction of a new product  reward checking other expenses increased as a result of higher security expenses  atm charge offs and miscellaneous lending expenses as a result of loan volume 
the following table shows the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated

income tax expense corresponds to an effective rate of  and for the three years ended december    and  respectively 
while our statutory rate is based on our income level and our actual net income was higher  our actual tax in benefited from adjustments to deferred taxes and tax exempt income which caused the effective rate to drop

loan portfolio loans  net of unearned income  increased to million at december   an increase of million or from million at year end the real estate loan portfolio was the growth driver in  increasing million  or  with the commercial  industrial and agricultural loan portfolio increasing by thousand  or and consumer loans  increasing for the first time in years as the result of credit card and overdraft protection loan growth 
this statistic is skewed by the mixing of some minor loan types 
the loan total for true consumer loans continues declining year to year but not as rapidly 
real estate construction loans grew million  or  while commercial real estate loans grew million  or 
the loan growth was driven by the continued economic expansion in the business markets that we serve 
however  the total dollar growth declined in by million when compared to million growth in at year end  loans  net of unearned income  were million  up million or from million at year end loan growth for all periods reported was primarily driven by increases in the real estate portfolio 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at december dollars in thousands commercial  industrial and agricultural loans residential real estate mortgage real estate construction commercial real estate consumer loans all other loans total loans less unearned income total loans net of unearned discount less allowance for loan losses net loans the following table presents loan categories that are particularly sensitive to rate changes remaining maturities of selected loans year ended december  variable rate fixed rate in thousands within year to years after years total to years after years total total maturities commercial agricultural real estate construction loans secured by real estate comprised approximately of our loan portfolio at december  within this category  residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio at december  and at december  and at year end while the percentage to total loan portfolio are similar each year  in residential real estate mortgages grew million  or 
this was the largest growth in any single loan category for the year and was aided by purchases from our mortgage company 
commercial real estate loans declined from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end real estate construction loans grew over balances and accounted for of total loans outstanding at year end compared to at year end and at year end our losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charge offs per year over the last five years 
consumer loans are again the fifth largest component of our loan portfolio in comprising of the portfolio at year end compared to at year end and and at year end and  respectively 
this portfolio s primary component consists of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  up thousand from million at year end 
the increase was the result of increases in the credit card loans and some overdraft protection type loans which make up a minor part of the category 
lifestyle changes with emphasis on fast and easy one step loans have created intense competition for consumer borrowing dollars 
this change combined with the automotive industry s various rebate programs with low rates at the dealer location continue a trend that started in of decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased in total dollars outstanding to million at december  compared to million at december  however  due to the growth of real estate loans  it comprised only of the total portfolio at year end compared to at year end and at year end the growth in real estate construction and commercial  industrial and agricultural loans emphasize our clear commitment to support small to medium sized businesses 
consistent with our focus on providing community based financial services  we generally do not make loans outside of our principal market region 
we do not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
we further maintain a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
our unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  compared to million at year end unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  our loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
however  as we expand into newer markets  to us  we are encountering other collateral options which in lieu of real estate  are booked based on strong credit guidelines and controls to monitor the status of the collateral 
asset quality our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  we consider our historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  experience and depth of lending staff  effects of credit concentrations and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
our ratio of nonperforming assets at year end decreased to compared to at december  and down from at december  this measure emphasizes our continued vigilance of our loan portfolio 
actual nonperforming assets were flat at million at year end and  respectively 
net charge offs for increased thousand or to thousand  compared to thousand for the year in we have a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans  including a sfas no 
review for determining specific reserves 
we utilize a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  collateral and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
when the lending environment and the economic markets generate precursors of bad times  such as those that occurred at the end of and the beginning of  management  using prudent judgment  added to the reserve in and may increase the reserve in to prepare for possible losses 
continued good asset quality in allowed us to maintain a lower loan loss allowance ratio through most of the year 
unfortunately  in the fourth quarter the bottom fell out of the subprime lending market creating a snowball effect on all businesses associated with these financial instruments 
while evb does not have any of these loans  we still have to deal with the market operating in a state of fear and panic at the end of  therefore  management increased the provision expense in the fourth quarter to raise the ratio 
in  at year end  evb had a ratio of compared to at year end and to at december   respectively 
for the same dates  the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may review such factors as the method used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

nonperforming assets total nonperforming assets  consisting of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  and other real estate owned  decreased thousand or to million at year end  while total loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  increased million or to million for the same period 
the ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate at year end was compared to at year end nonperforming loans at year end were million which included million in nonaccrual loans with million of those loans secured by real estate in our market area  thousand of commercial and agricultural loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  we consider the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
the total amount of non real estate secured nonaccrual loans was thousand 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the time when the collection of principal and interest are considered to be doubtful 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and  respectively 
the balance of the nonperforming assets at year end is the other real estate owned in the amount of million compared to none in this amount represents three houses under construction upon which the bank exercised a forbearance claim  took title to the houses and is having the homes completed to be sold at completion 
the assessed value of the completed homes is above the total that the bank has in the loan and we expect to be fully covered by the sale 
in an abundance of caution  the bank also took a third deed of trust on the developers home  which is in an affluent part of the city of richmond  and intends to payoff the first deed in order to gain control of the property 
the sale of this property to the holder of the second deed of trust or an outside party should provide enough cash flow to further protect the bank from loss

although trends for credit quality factors were stable through most of  it is likely that evb  in light of the turbulent economic environment  will continue provisions for loan losses in at a slightly higher level 
the primary factors for additional provision are growth in the loan portfolio and the possibility of an economic downturn in as noted in many economic forecasts 
at december   we reported million in impaired loans of which thousand was included in nonperforming loans 
loans are viewed as impaired based upon individual evaluations of discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
securities securities available for sale include those securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors  and are carried at estimated fair market value 
at december   the securities portfolio  at fair market value  was million  a increase from million at year end which was a decrease from million at year end 
the effect of valuing the available for sale portfolio at market  net of income taxes  is reflected as a line in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income of negative million at december  and a negative million at year end 
we follow a policy of not engaging in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as options  futures  swaps or forward commitments 
we consider derivatives to be speculative in nature and contrary to our historical philosophy 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deposits we have historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost and stable source of funding for our asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
our million deposit growth  or in  following million  or  deposit growth in  was less than our loan growth in both periods and required us to continue spending more for deposits and to borrow from the fhlb to fund loan growth 
this continues an interest rate trend noted in and and is the result of interest rates moving to an inverted yield curve  where short term rates tend to be higher than long term rates 
total deposits at december  of million increased from million at year end 
noninterest bearing deposits decreased by million or to million at year end compared to million at december  during the same period  interest bearing deposits increased to million at year end  compared to million at december  while these figures represent the balances at december  or  it is more meaningful to review average deposits for the year  which reflect how much we are really funding over the year 
for  average total deposits of million reflected a increase over the average of million 
average deposits for  while up overall  continued a definite movement out of lower priced deposits into higher paying funds  such as we experienced in the only difference between the two years is a smaller volume of growth and percentage change in savings and money market savings accounts decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively 
in  these same categories declined and  respectively 
in  large dollar and regular certificates of deposit increased million  or  and million  or  respectively  continuing the trend of when these products increased and  respectively 
interest bearing checking accounts now increased million  or  in compared to an increase of million in this increase is attributed to a new product  reward checking  introduced late in the third quarter of this product pays a higher interest rate on customer s deposits  if they adhere to four basic rules which encourage the customer to utilize online banking and electronic transactions which provide transactions that are less costly to the bank 
while the quoted to the customer through seems high  the real cost for reward checking accounts was about 
thus we kept deposits for less than our certificate of deposit rates 
demand deposit average balances decreased thousand  or less than  in deposits were harder to come by in and continued a pattern of the last two years created by the high interest rate environment imposed by the federal reserve 
with the interest rate cuts in the later part of  this environment is changing and the subprime lending turmoil has caused this process to occur faster than normal 
management s challenge in is to manage the net interest margin in a repricing environment where deposits reprice slower that earning assets 
total deposits at year end of million an increase of million or compared to million at year end 
the deposit growth in was the result of increases in certificates of deposit  demand and now deposits 
all other deposit categories declined in average deposits for were million  an increase of  or million  compared to average deposits of million

capital represents original investment by shareholders plus retained earnings and provides financial resources over which we can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings  plus trust preferred debt up to of tier capital  less goodwill and intangibles 
at december   we had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support our banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
in january  we announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
this plan was amended in and the number of shares that can be repurchased is of the outstanding shares on january of each year 
we repurchased  shares in and no shares in or details of the number of shares available and purchases by month can be seen on page in item in december  we completed an offering of our common stock 
we sold million shares and received over million net proceeds in new capital 
these funds gave us flexibility in which allowed us to fund assets purchases early in with out borrowing and gave us flexibility in a tight deposit milieu 
the following table provides an analysis of our capital as of december    and note in the consolidated financial statements presents an analysis of the capital position of both our company and evb as of year end  and analysis of capital at december  dollars in thousands tier capital common stock surplus retained earnings total equity trust preferred debt less goodwill and intangibles total tier capital tier capital allowance for loan losses deductions for other investments total risk based capital risk based assets capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier capital to average total assets regulatory authorities require a deduction from capital for the value of other llc s in which we have an ownership interest 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had million of off balance sheet credit exposure in the form of million of commitments to grant loans and unfunded commitments under lines of credit and million of standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by us  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we are committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending a loan to our customers 
we generally hold collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
our management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level that we believe is sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet our customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
we also maintain additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with immediately available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  we had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
during  we executed new borrowings of million and had paydowns of million in fhlb borrowings 
the following table presents our contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond 
payments due by period as of total less than year years years over years dollars in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
accounting rule changes refer to note of the audited financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
we are responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the board of directors reviews guidelines established by management 
it is our policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
we consider derivatives as speculative which is contrary to our historical or prospective philosophy 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do hold in our loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in index rates which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of our future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by our asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap at year end was a positive which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would decrease approximately of stable rate or base net income if rates were to fall immediately by basis points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by basis points 
management believes this reflects an asset sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon although an alternative calculation indicates an asset sensitive position in a day horizon and a slightly liability sensitive position in a one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less than a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures
