item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
business strategy and overview our strategy is to create a value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a competitive cost structure  iii effective management information systems that enable success and iv outstanding employees focused on achieving operational excellence in a global market in order to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 
our goals are focused on i operating our facilities in a safe  reliable  and environmentally responsible way  ii improving cash flow by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies  and iii using excess cash flows from operations in a balanced way to create further shareholder value 
during  we achieved the following relative to our goals  which are further described below under results of operations and capital resources liquidity we acquired and fully integrated the los angeles refinery and retail networks of shell branded and usa gasoline tm branded retail stations 
prior to completing the acquisitions  we set a year end goal to reduce our debt to capitalization ratio to or below 
as of december  our debt to capitalization ratio was 
achieved million in synergies during through our acquisitions  mainly through shared crude cargo benefits 
our cash flows from operating activities were billion  an increase of million from in june  we doubled the cash dividend on our common stock from per share reflects may two for one stock split to per share 
we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling million or per share during excluding the los angeles refinery  we achieved average throughput of  barrels per day  which was just below the  barrels per day record set in we managed the largest capital program in our history totaling million and completed several strategic capital projects during as described below 

table of contents industry overview and outlook the global fundamentals of the refining industry remained strong during continued demand growth in developing areas such as india and china and global political concerns supported high prices for crude oil and refined products 
in the us  refining margins remained above historical levels during the first half of in part due to the following continued gasoline and diesel demand growth coupled with limited production capacity  lower refinery utilization due to heavy industry turnaround activity and unplanned outages  low product inventories  a continuing reliance on gasoline imports  and new lower sulfur standards for non road diesel  which went into effect on june  during the second half of  industry refined product margins on the us west coast declined substantially as moderately rising product prices lagged rapidly rising crude oil prices 
the average cost of alaska north slope ans crude oil presented in the graph below  for example  increased by approximately per barrel during the third quarter and per barrel during the fourth quarter  as compared to the second quarter 
the rapid increase in crude oil prices reflects continued worldwide demand growth  concerns over declining crude oil supplies  the weakening us dollar and investment fund speculation 
while crude prices rose sharply  product prices on the us west coast increased only moderately during the last half of reflecting lower product demand and rising product inventories 
product demand on the us west coast was negatively impacted due to the weakening us economy  seasonality and inclement weather in california during december 
in addition to weakening product demand  the increase in product inventories was also a result of strong refinery utilization during the fourth quarter 
the following three factors should have a positive impact on industry refining margins beginning late in the first quarter of i lower planned industry production runs combined with the impact of planned turnarounds  ii the seasonal reductions of gasoline inventories due to the transition into summer grade gasoline and iii increased seasonal demand 
while we continue to be concerned about demand growth and the potential for a us recession  we believe us west coast industry refining margins should return to their five year historical averages for the remainder of acquisitions los angeles assets on may  we acquired a thousand barrels per day mbpd refinery and a mbpd refined products terminal located south of los angeles  california along with a network of shell branded retail stations are company operated located throughout southern california collectively  the los angeles assets from shell oil products us shell 
we will continue to operate the retail stations using the shell brand under a long term agreement 
the purchase price for the los angeles assets was billion which includes million for petroleum inventories and direct costs of million 
the purchase price of the los angeles assets was paid for with billion of debt and the remainder with cash on hand 
borrowings totaling 
table of contents million under our revolver were repaid in with cash flows from operating activities 
for further information on our financing of the acquisition  see capital resources and liquidity capitalization herein 
we expect to realize annual recurring synergies of approximately million in connection with our acquisitions through our crude oil purchasing and shipping logistics as well as by maximizing the production of clean fuels for the california market 
during  we achieved approximately million of our million synergy goal mainly through shared crude cargo benefits 
based on our most recent estimates  we expect to spend approximately billion to billion from through for projects to improve reliability  energy efficiency and conversion capability and to upgrade refinery infrastructure to comply with regulatory requirements at the los angeles refinery 
the projects include an upgrade project designed to increase heavy crude processing capacity  which is under further review and evaluation 
the project  if approved  would cost between million to million with estimated completion by the end of we are also planning to install a new cogeneration facility and boilers to reduce air emissions and improve reliability and efficiency 
this project  if approved  would cost approximately million to million with estimated completion in late these projects continue to be under evaluation 
the cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
our regulatory projects include replacing underground pipelines with above ground pipelines as required by an order from the california regional water quality control board 
this project is estimated to be completed in and will cost approximately million 
our regulatory projects also include a fuel gas treating unit designed to reduce fuel gas sulfur and new flare gas recovery compressors designed to meet flaring requirements of the south coast air quality management district 
we project to spend approximately million through to complete the fuel gas treating unit project and approximately million through to install the flare gas recovery compressors 
these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
spending on refinery turnaround and other maintenance at the los angeles refinery is expected to be approximately million to million from through these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
usa petroleum retail stations on may   we acquired retail stations located primarily in california from usa petroleum the usa petroleum assets 
the purchase price of the assets and the usa gasoline tm brand name was paid in cash totaling million including inventories of million and direct costs of million 
this acquisition  along with the acquired shell branded retail stations  provides us with retail stations near our golden eagle and los angeles refineries that will allow us to optimize production  invest in refinery improvements and deliver more clean products into the california market 
in addition  greater economies of scale were created as we nearly doubled our retail network by adding retail stations 
strategic capital projects to achieve our strategy of a competitive cost structure and earning competitive returns in any margin environment  we focus on capital projects that improve safety and reliability  enhance our crude oil flexibility  improve clean product yields and increase energy efficiency 
our capital budget is million 
all capital expenditures  whether actual or expected  include estimates of capitalized interest and labor 
see capital resources and liquidity for additional information related to our budgeted and actual capital spending 
completed strategic capital projects during  we completed the following strategic capital projects a diesel desulfurizer unit  bpd at our alaska refinery which enables us to manufacture ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd and become the sole producer of ulsd in alaska  the amorco wharf project at our golden eagle refinery which lowers our crude costs as we can now supply all of the refinery s crude oil requirements by water  
table of contents two sulfur handling projects at our washington refinery  which allow us to process a greater percentage of sour crude oils at the refinery  and the control modernization project at our golden eagle refinery  which converted our older refinery control technologies to a modern digital system  allowing us to improve refining yields and reduce energy costs 
golden eagle coker modification project the million coker modification project at our golden eagle refinery is currently scheduled to be substantially completed during the first quarter of the modification of our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker unit will enable us to comply with the terms of an abatement order to lower air emissions while also enhancing the refinery s capabilities in terms of reliability  lengthening turnaround cycles and lowering maintenance costs 
by extending the typical coker turnaround cycle from years to years  we will effectively increase clean fuels production and significantly reduce the duration and costs of coker turnarounds 
future strategic capital projects during the third quarter of  we expect to complete the selective hydrogenation unit shu at our washington refinery  which will reduce the sulfur content in gasoline 
the shu will allow a higher percentage of sour crude oils to be processed at the refinery 
beyond  we are currently evaluating several projects that focus on our strategic goals 
at our golden eagle and hawaii refineries we are evaluating crude oil flexibility projects that would allow us to process a more diverse slate of less expensive sour crude oils 
these projects  if approved  would be completed by the end of at our los angeles refinery  we are also evaluating an upgrade project designed to increase heavy crude processing capacity as described above and projects to increase our capability of receiving waterborne crude oil through access at our port of long beach terminal 
we are also studying energy efficiency projects at all of our refineries 
these projects are preliminary and are subject to further review and analysis 
hawaii refinery initiatives during  gross refining margins at our hawaii refinery declined by million from the significant decline in gross refining margins year over year reflects the decrease in industry margins and the following factors hawaii s reliance on light sweet crude from asia  which has been pricing at a premium  finished product sales agreements that did not keep pace with rapidly rising crude prices  and unplanned downtime on the refinery s reformer unit and related repairs and maintenance expenses 
we have several initiatives to address these issues at hawaii in these initiatives include changes to our crude slate to reduce the amount of asian light sweet crudes  achieving better value for finished products marketed in hawaii  and improving reliability primarily through i a control modernization project which also improves refining yields and reduces energy costs and ii a project to install a new electrical substation to improve electrical reliability  both of which are expected to be completed in cash dividends on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of per share  payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  during  we paid cash dividends on common stock totaling per share

h we experienced reduced throughput during scheduled turnarounds for the following refineries the los angeles  golden eagle  and utah refineries during  the golden eagle  washington and alaska refineries during  and the golden eagle  washington and hawaii refineries during compared to overview 
the decrease in operating income of million during was primarily due to reduced gross refining margins per barrel and increased operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increased throughput 
during  total gross refining margin per barrel decreased by from  reflecting significantly lower industry margins on the us west coast during the last six months of us refined product margins during the first six months of remained well above historical levels primarily due to strong product demand  lower industry refinery utilization due to heavy turnaround activity and unplanned outages  low product inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non road diesel beginning june  however  during the second half of industry refined product margins on the us west coast fell substantially as moderately rising product prices lagged rapidly rising crude oil prices as described above in industry overview 
industry margins on the us west coast in the second half of were much stronger compared to the second half of reflecting stronger product demand  lower average product inventories and the introduction of new sulfur requirements for gasoline and diesel 
in addition  during the fourth quarter we experienced record industry margins due to extensive industry turnaround activity and unplanned downtime on the us west coast 
gross refining margins 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting increased refining throughput as a result of acquiring the los angeles refinery partly offset by lower per barrel gross refining margins particularly at our hawaii refinery 
discussion of our results by refining region is presented below 
during  gross refining margins in our california and pacific northwest regions declined and  respectively 
the sharp decline in us west coast industry margins during the second half of  compared to the same period in when industry refining margins in the region were robust  resulted in a decline in our gross refining margins during other factors that negatively impacted our gross refining margins in the california region during included i the scheduled refinery maintenance turnarounds at our golden eagle refinery of the fluid catalytic cracker fcc and hydrocracking units and subsequent extension of the fcc turnaround during the first quarter due to unanticipated repairs and equipment malfunctions  ii unscheduled downtime at our golden eagle refinery during the third quarter which increased feedstock costs and reduced throughput  and iii contractual purchase commitments and certain refinery logistical limitations at our los angeles refinery which limited our ability to capture the cost differentials between foreign sourced and local crudes 
we have identified opportunities to improve our optimization of foreign sourced crude purchases at our los angeles refinery and we expect to realize these opportunities beginning in the pacific northwest region was negatively impacted by unscheduled maintenance of the boiler unit for the fcc and scheduled maintenance on two hydrotreating units at our 
table of contents washington refinery during the third quarter resulting in reduced operating income of approximately million 
in our mid pacific region  gross refining margins declined during  reflecting the decline in us west coast industry margins during the second half of crude oil costs in the region were impacted as asian sweet crude oils realized higher premiums due to strong asian demand 
at the same time  several of our term product contracts have lagging pricing provisions  which prevented us from fully passing along the rising crude oil costs 
in addition  an unplanned outage of the hawaii refinery s reformer unit during the fourth quarter negatively impacted results by an estimated million  including million of higher repairs and maintenance expenses 
in our mid continent region  gross refining margins increased per barrel during reflecting strong product demand from the farming sector and unplanned refinery outages at several refineries during the first half of we were also able to take advantage of more discounted local light sweet crudes during the fourth quarter 
our gross refining margins were also impacted by our non trading derivative positions during our derivative positions were negatively impacted by rapidly rising crude oil costs  which reduced our gross refining margins by million year over year 
during and  our derivative positions resulted in a million loss and a million gain  respectively 
for additional information relating to our non trading derivative program see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included herein 
refining throughput 
total refining throughput averaged mbpd in compared to mbpd during  primarily reflecting average refining throughput at our los angeles refinery of mbpd see footnote b of the table above for information related to refining throughput at our los angeles refinery 
excluding the los angeles refinery  we continued to achieve near record throughput levels reflecting on going reliability and operating efficiencies 
scheduled downtime during and that negatively impacted refining throughput is described in footnote h of the table above 
we also experienced unscheduled downtime in at our golden eagle  washington and hawaii refineries as described above 
during  we experienced unscheduled downtime at our alaska refinery as a result of the grounding of our time chartered vessel which impacted the supply of feedstocks to the refinery 
refined product sales 
revenues from sales of refined products increased during primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes 
our average refined product sales price increased to per barrel reflecting the increase in crude oil prices 
total refined product sales volumes increased mbpd in  primarily reflecting additional sales volumes from our los angeles refinery 
expenses 
our average costs of sales increased to per barrel during  reflecting the significant increase in crude oil prices during the year 
manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to billion in  compared with million in  with million of the increase incurred by the los angeles refinery 
the remaining increase of million reflects higher repairs and maintenance expenses of million  increased employee costs of million  higher marine charter expenses of million and increased utilities costs of million 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in  compared to million in  reflecting depreciation and amortization of million associated with the los angeles refinery and increased depreciation from our recent investments in capital projects 
loss on asset disposals and impairments decreased by million primarily due to charges of million during relating to the termination of a delayed coker project at our washington refinery 
we anticipate our operating expenses during at our los angeles refinery will be consistent with the fourth quarter primarily due to continued elevated repair and maintenance costs to address aging assets and front end engineering costs for our capital projects that are not capitalized 
however  over the next five years we expect to decrease our operating expenses at the refinery by an estimated as inflationary cost increases are more than offset by lower energy and repair and maintenance costs 
we expect to reduce energy costs assuming energy prices are comparable to as a result of planned capital projects including a new cogeneration facility and boilers as discussed above in business strategy and overview 
we also estimate that repair and maintenance costs beyond will be lower as a result of implementing new maintenance efficiency and reliability programs along with benefits from our planned capital projects 

table of contents compared to overview 
the increase in operating income of million was primarily due to increased gross refining margins  partially offset by higher depreciation expense and the increased loss on asset disposals and impairments 
total gross refining margins increased from reflecting higher industry margins in all of our regions 
the higher industry margins in reflected the following factors continued strong demand for refined products  limited production capacity in the us  a stronger reliance on gasoline imports  strong global economic growth  the introduction of new sulfur requirements for gasoline and diesel  the elimination of mtbe  extended downtime at three refineries in the us gulf coast damaged by hurricanes in  and higher than normal industry turnaround activity during the first half of and extensive turnaround activity on the us west coast in the fourth quarter 
during the second half of  industry margins were higher than the same period in due to production and supply disruptions on the us gulf coast caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
gross refining margins 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions  particularly in our mid continent and pacific northwest regions 
in our mid continent region  gross refining margins increased during  reflecting lower feedstock costs due to higher local crude production and strong diesel demand 
during  margins in our mid continent region were negatively impacted by certain factors primarily during the first quarter  including higher crude oil costs due to canadian production constraints and a depressed market in the salt lake city area due to record high first quarter production in padd iv 
in our pacific northwest region  gross refining margins increased year over year despite a scheduled turnaround at our washington refinery during the fourth quarter 
margins were positively impacted by continued strong demand on the us west coast along with higher than normal industry maintenance and unscheduled refining industry downtime 
by comparison  certain factors negatively impacted our gross refining margins in during the first quarter  margins in our pacific northwest region were negatively impacted as our washington refinery completed a scheduled turnaround of the crude and naphtha reforming units and incurred unscheduled downtime of certain processing equipment 
in addition  our gross refining margins in the region during the first half of were negatively impacted as the increased differential between light and heavy crude oil depressed the margins for heavy fuel oils 
refining throughput 
total refining throughput averaged mbpd in compared to mbpd during during  we continued to achieve near record throughput levels reflecting on going reliability and operating efficiencies due to recent scheduled turnarounds 
in addition  our on going process controls modernization programs at our golden eagle and washington refineries contributed to higher throughput during the second half of scheduled downtime during and that negatively impacted refining throughput is described in footnote h of the table above

during  we had unscheduled downtime at our golden eagle and washington refineries 
refined product sales 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in from billion in  primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices  partially offset by lower refined product sales volumes 
our average refined product prices increased to per barrel reflecting the continued strength in product demand 
total refined product sales averaged mbpd in  a 
table of contents decrease of mbpd from  reflecting recording certain purchases and sales transactions on a net basis as described in footnote g of the table above 
expenses 
our average costs of sales increased to per barrel during  reflecting significantly higher average feedstock prices 
manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to million in  compared with million in  primarily due to increased employee costs of million  higher repairs and maintenance of million and increased catalyst and chemical costs of million 
the increase was partially offset by reclassifying certain pipeline and terminal costs of million in from other operating costs to costs of sales 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in  compared to million in due in part to additional depreciation of million due to shortening the estimated lives and recording asset retirement obligations of certain assets at our golden eagle refinery beginning in the fourth quarter of the increase in depreciation and amortization also reflects increasing capital expenditures 
loss on asset disposals and impairments increased to million in from million in  primarily due to pretax charges of million related to the termination of a delayed coker project at our washington refinery

capital resources and liquidity overview we operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products  availability of trade credit  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  geo political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our credit agreement and other sources of capital  may be affected by these conditions 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  million of borrowings under our revolver  and billion in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after million in outstanding letters of credit 
we also have two separate letter of credit agreements of which we had million available after million in outstanding letters of credit as of december  we believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements 
acquisitions on may   we acquired the los angeles assets for billion which includes million for petroleum inventories and direct costs of million 
to fund the acquisition  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  borrowed million under our amended and restated credit agreement and paid the remainder with cash on hand 
the borrowings totaling million under our revolver were repaid in with cash flows from operating activities

represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks  with remaining terms ranging from months to years 
prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate with market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices as of december   ranging by crude oil type from per barrel to per barrel  and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which are not included in the table above

environmental and other matters tesoro is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in certain emission sources 
conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  pipelines  retail stations operating and closed locations and refined products terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amounts of such future expenditures 
for further information on environmental matters and other contingencies  see note m in our consolidated financial statements in item environmental liabilities we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our previously owned properties 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline and terminal operations and retail stations 
we believe these accruals are adequate  based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions 
these estimated environmental liabilities require judgment to assess and estimate the future costs to remediate 
it is reasonably possible that additional remediation costs will be incurred as more information becomes available related to these environmental matters 
changes in our environmental liabilities for the years ended december  and were as follows in millions years ended december  balance at beginning of year additions expenditures acquisitions settlement agreement balance at end of year on march   we settled our dispute with tosco corporation tosco concerning soil and groundwater conditions at the golden eagle refinery 
we received million from conocophillips as successor in interest to tosco and phillips petroleum  both former owners and operators of the refinery 
in exchange for the settlement proceeds we assumed responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august of at december   our accrual for these environmental liabilities totaled million 
we expect to have valid insurance claims under certain environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to million for liabilities in excess of the settlement proceeds attributable to tosco 
amounts recorded for these environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible insurance recoveries 
we are continuing to investigate environmental conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our golden eagle refinery 
this investigation is driven by an order from the san francisco bay regional water quality 
table of contents control board that names us as well as two previous owners of the golden eagle refinery 
a reserve for this matter is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
in march  we received an offer from the bay area air quality management district the district to settle notices of violation novs for million 
the novs allege violations of air quality at our golden eagle refinery 
in january  we agreed to settle this matter for million pending the negotiation of a final agreement with the district 
a reserve for this matter is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
in october  we received an nov from the united states environmental protection agency epa concerning our washington refinery 
the epa alleges certain modifications made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit at our washington refinery prior to our acquisition of the refinery were made in violation of the clean air act 
we have investigated the allegations and believe the ultimate resolution of the nov will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
a reserve for our response to the nov is included in the environmental accruals referenced above 
other environmental matters we are a defendant  along with other manufacturing  supply and marketing defendants  in ten pending cases alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
in december  we agreed to participate in a proposed settlement of seven and part of an eighth of the pending cases subject to negotiation of settlement documents 
the defendants are being sued for having manufactured mtbe and having manufactured  supplied and distributed gasoline containing mtbe 
the plaintiffs  all in california  are generally water providers  governmental authorities and private well owners alleging  in part  the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees 
a reserve for the cases included in the proposed settlement is included in other accrued liabilities 
we believe the final resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  but at this time we cannot estimate the amount or the likelihood of the ultimate resolution of the cases not subject to the settlement 
we believe we have defenses to the claims in the remaining cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in those lawsuits 
on january  we received an offer of settlement from the alaska department of environmental conservation adec related to the grounding of a vessel in the alaska cook inlet on february  the adec has alleged two vessels chartered by us violated provisions of our cook inlet vessel oil prevention and contingency plan during the period from december to february the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable  and some matters may require years for us to resolve 
as a result  we have not established reserves for these matters 
on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we cannot provide assurance that an adverse resolution of the matter described below during a future reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in future periods 
on december  we received an nov from adec alleging that our alaska refinery violated provisions of its clean air act title v operating permit 
we are negotiating a resolution of the nov with adec and do not believe the resolution will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
environmental capital expenditures epa regulations related to the clean air act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline 
we are installing a gasoline hydrotreater at our utah refinery to satisfy the requirements of the regulations 
during  we spent million and have budgeted an additional million through to complete the project 
our other refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the low sulfur gasoline standards 

table of contents epa regulations related to the clean air act also require reductions in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new on road diesel fuel standards became effective on june  in may  the epa issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non road diesel fuel 
the requirements to reduce non road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases between and in may  we completed the diesel desulfurizer unit at our alaska refinery  enabling the refinery to manufacture ultra low sulfur diesel 
we spent million on this project in we are currently evaluating alternative projects that will satisfy the future requirements under existing regulations at our north dakota  utah and hawaii refineries 
our golden eagle  los angeles  washington and alaska refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the new diesel fuel standards 
in february  the epa issued regulations for the reduction of benzene in gasoline 
we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  however  based on our most recent estimates we expect to spend approximately million to million between and to meet the new regulations at five of our refineries 
these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
our golden eagle and los angeles refineries will not require capital spending to meet the new benzene reduction standards 
during the fourth quarter of  we received approval by the hearing board for the bay area air quality management district to modify our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker at our golden eagle refinery which is designed to lower emissions while also enhancing the refinery s capabilities in terms of reliability  lengthening turnaround cycles and reducing operating costs 
we negotiated the terms and conditions of the second conditional abatement order with the district in response to the january mechanical failure of the fluid coker boiler at the golden eagle refinery 
the total capital for this project is estimated to be million  which includes remaining spending of million in the project is currently scheduled to be substantially completed during the first quarter of  with spending through the first half of we have spent million from inception of the project  of which million was spent in the los angeles refinery is subject to extensive environmental requirements 
the los angeles refinery will reduce nox emissions by the end of in response to regulations imposed by the south coast air quality management district 
our current plans for compliance include the replacement of our less efficient power cogeneration units and steam boilers 
we expect to spend approximately million to million with estimated completion in late we also will replace underground pipelines with above ground pipelines as required by an order from the california regional water quality control board 
this project is estimated to be completed in and will cost approximately million 
our regulatory requirements also include a fuel gas treating unit designed to reduce fuel gas sulfur and new flare gas recovery compressors designed to meet flaring requirements of the south coast air quality management district 
we project to spend approximately million through to complete the fuel gas treating unit project and approximately million through to install the flare gas recovery compressors 
these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
we have developed a plan to eliminate the use of any atmospheric blowdown towers by constructing alternative emission control units at our refineries 
we believe that this plan will provide for safer operating conditions for our employees and will address environmental regulatory issues related to monitoring potential air emissions from components connected to the blowdown towers 
we have spent million during and we have budgeted an additional million through to complete this project at two of our refineries 
in connection with the acquisition of our golden eagle refinery  we agreed to undertake projects at our golden eagle refinery to reduce air emissions required by a consent decree with the epa concerning the section refinery enforcement initiative under the clean air act 
we spent million during and have budgeted an additional million through to satisfy the requirements of the consent decree 
we will spend additional capital at the golden eagle refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery 
we spent million during and we have budgeted an additional million through we also spent million during and we expect to spend an additional million through to upgrade a marine oil wharf at the golden eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the state of california in february this cost estimate is preliminary and subject to further review 

table of contents in connection with our acquisition of our north dakota and utah refineries  tesoro assumed the seller s obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co 
bp  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the owner of these refineries  tesoro is required to address issues to reduce air emissions 
we spent million during and we have budgeted an additional million through to comply with this consent decree 
we also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
the california air resources board regulations require the installation of enhanced vapor recovery systems at all california gasoline retail stations by april the enhanced vapor recovery systems control and contain gasoline vapor emissions during motor vehicle fueling 
we spent million during and have budgeted approximately million through to satisfy the requirements of the enhanced vapor recovery regulations 
in december  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act  which  among other things sets a target of miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks by model year and modified the industry requirements for renewable fuel standard rfs 
the rfs now stands at billion gallons in rising to billion gallons by both requirements could reduce demand growth for petroleum products in the future 
in the near term  the rfs presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for both the ethanol and refining industries and may require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased ethanol use 
these requirements are currently under study 
in june  the california resources air board proposed amendments to the predictive model for compliant gasoline in the state of california that decreases the allowable sulfur levels to a cap of parts per million and allows for additional ethanol to be blended into gasoline 
the requirements begin december  but may be postponed by individual companies until december  through the use of the alternative emission reduction plan which allows for the acquisition of emissions offsets from sources not directly related to petroleum fuel use 
we expect both of our california refineries to be in compliance with the regulation by the deadline and expect to spend approximately million through to meet the requirements 
pension funding for all eligible employees  we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan with benefits based on years of service and compensation 
our long term expected return on plan assets is  and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a return of million in and million in based on a discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december   the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of however  the funded employee pension plan was funded based on its current liability  which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations 
although tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in  we voluntarily contributed million to improve the funded status of the plan 
we currently have no minimum required contribution obligation to our funded employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in  however  we currently expect to contribute approximately million in future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets  employee demographics and other factors

claims against third parties in  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
our protest asserted that the taps intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced 
the regulatory commission of alaska rca considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years through the rca set just and reasonable final rates for the years through in order  and held that we are entitled to receive approximately million in refunds  including interest through the expected conclusion of appeals in in february  the alaska supreme court  affirmed the rca s order 
table of contents in  the rca rejected the taps carriers proposed intrastate rate increases for and maintained the permanent rate of to the valdez marine terminal 
that ruling is currently on appeal to the alaska superior court 
the rate decrease has been in effect since june the taps carriers subsequently attempted to increase their intrastate rates for    and without providing the supporting information required by the rca s regulations and in a manner inconsistent with the rca s prior decision in order these filings were rejected by the rca 
the rejection of these filings is currently on appeal to the alaska superior court where the decision is being held in abeyance pending the decision in the appeals of the rates for if the rca s decisions are upheld on appeal  we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our shipments from january through mid june if the rca s decisions are not upheld on appeal  we could potentially have to pay the difference between the taps carriers filed rates from mid june through december  averaging approximately per barrel and the rca s approved rate for this period per barrel plus interest for the approximately million barrels we have transported through taps in intrastate commerce during this period 
we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in these appeals 
we also believe that  should we not prevail on appeal  the amount of additional shipping charges cannot reasonably be estimated since it is not possible to estimate the permanent rate which the rca could set  and the appellate courts approve  for each year 
in addition  depending upon the level of such rates  there is a reasonable possibility that any refunds for the period january through mid july could offset some or all of any additional payments due for the period mid june through december  in january of  tesoro alaska company intervened in a protest before the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  of the taps carriers interstate rates for and if tesoro alaska company prevails and lower rates are set  we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our interstate shipments for and we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this proceeding 
in july  the taps carriers filed a proceeding at the ferc seeking to have the ferc assume jurisdiction under section of the interstate commerce act and set future rates for intrastate transportation on taps 
we filed a protest in that proceeding  which has been consolidated with the other ferc proceeding seeking to set just and reasonable interstate rates on taps for and on may   the presiding judge in this consolidated ferc proceeding lowered the interstate rates and refused to revise the current intrastate rates 
the taps carriers have requested that the ferc reverse the presiding judge 
we cannot give assurances of when or whether we will prevail in this proceeding 
if the taps carriers should prevail  then the rates charged for all shipments of alaska north slope crude oil on taps could be revised by the ferc  but any ferc changes to rates for intrastate transportation of crude oil supplies for our alaska refinery should be prospective only and should not affect prior intrastate rates  refunds or additional payments
