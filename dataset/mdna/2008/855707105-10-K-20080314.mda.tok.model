item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms used in this item and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to such terms under the caption important defined terms used in this form k which immediately precedes part i of this form k 
overview state auto financial is a property and casualty insurance holding company primarily engaged in writing both personal and business lines of insurance 
the state auto group markets a broad line of property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in states 
state auto financial s subsidiaries are state auto p c  milbank  farmers  sa ohio and sa national  each of which is a property and casualty insurance company  stateco  which provides investment management services to affiliated insurance companies  sis  a developer and seller of insurance related software  and pml  which owns and leases property to affiliated companies 
sis and pml are not material to our total operations 
state auto mutual owns approximately of state auto financial s outstanding common shares 
state auto p c  milbank  farmers and sa ohio stfc pooled companies participate in a quota share reinsurance pooling arrangement the pooling arrangement with state auto mutual  sa florida  sa wisconsin  meridian security and meridian citizens mutual  which together with stfc pooled companies are referred to as the pooled companies 
the pooled companies provide a broad line of property and casualty insurance  such as standard personal and commercial automobile  homeowners and farmowners  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  general liability and property insurance 
sa national  which is not included in the pooling arrangement  provides nonstandard personal automobile insurance 
our pooled companies and sa national are rated a superior by the am best company 
under the pooling arrangement  each of the pooled companies cedes premiums  losses and expenses on all of its business to state auto mutual  and state auto mutual in turn cedes to each of the pooled companies a specified portion of premiums  losses and expenses based on each of the pooled companies respective pooling percentages 
state auto mutual then retains the balance of the pooled business 
the participation percentage for the stfc pooled companies has remained at since in general  the pooling arrangement covers all the property and casualty insurance written by the pooled companies except state auto mutual s voluntary assumed reinsurance  middle market business insurance written by state auto mutual and meridian security and intercompany catastrophe reinsurance written by state auto p c 
as of january   the pooling arrangement was modified to add meridian security and meridian citizens mutual as participants 
in conjunction with this modification  the stfc pooled companies received million in cash from these two companies which related to the additional net insurance liabilities assumed on january  as of january   the pooling arrangement was further modified to add patrons mutual  litchfield and beacon national as participants and to include the middle market business insurance written by state auto mutual and meridian security 
concurrently with the addition of patrons mutual  litchfield and beacon national  the participating percentages of certain participants were adjusted as presented in the table below  however the stfc pooled companies continue to maintain an overall share of the pool at and state auto mutual and its subsidiaries and affiliates continue to maintain 
in conjunction with this modification  the stfc pooled companies will receive approximately million in cash from state auto mutual and its subsidiaries and affiliates

prior to january   we operated in two significant reportable segments  a standard segment and a nonstandard segment 
in  we undertook initiatives to realign our internal organization  specifically our people  processes  internal reporting systems and compensation reward programs  to become more focused within the business and personal insurance markets 
we established integrated personal and business insurance teams with product  profit and production responsibilities for their respective areas 
consequently  beginning with first quarter  our significant reportable segments are personal insurance  business insurance collectively the insurance segments or our insurance segments and investment operations  and we have begun reporting to our principal operating decision makers on these bases  analyzing each segment separately  to support our risk based pricing focus 
we evaluate the performance of our insurance segments using industry financial measurements determined based on statutory accounting principles sap  which include loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  underwriting expense ratios  combined ratios  statutory underwriting gain loss  net premiums earned and net written premiums 
one of the most significant differences between sap and generally accepted accounting principles gaap is that sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period the premium is earned 
we evaluate our investment operations segment based on investment returns of assets 
financial information about our segments for is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
prior period segment information has been restated to conform to current period presentation 
executive summary the results of our operations from year to year and quarter to quarter are primarily driven by our ability to generate revenue through selecting and pricing risks in a manner that permits premium growth without adversely 
table of contents affecting underwriting profits  and disciplined investment strategy 
we also recognize that our results will be periodically impacted  sometimes significantly  by the occurrence of catastrophic events  which are generally beyond our control 
premium growth underwriting profitability the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical 
our industry has been historically characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that result in increased prices and more favorable underwriting terms 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  some property and casualty insurers attempt to generate additional top line growth by setting their prices at levels inappropriate for the risk underwritten 
while in the short term this may result in additional revenues  this action compromises their long term underwriting profitability 
our strategy is to insure personal and small to medium business risks while adhering to disciplined and consistent underwriting principles through all market cycles 
our underwriting principles include insistence on selecting and retaining business based on the merits of each account and a dedication to cost based pricing  where each line of business is priced to generate a profit 
it is our intention to set pricing levels so that no line of business  or classification within major lines  subsidizes another line or classification 
we are committed to achieving an underwriting profit through all market cycles  even at the expense of periodic slowdowns in written and earned premiums 
we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agents by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and technology which make it easier for the agent to do business with the state auto group and provide substantial value to our customers 
we carefully monitor writing insurance in states that we believe present difficult legislative  judicial and or regulatory environments for the insurance industry 
investment strategy we have a disciplined approach to our investment strategy that emphasizes the quality of our fixed maturity portfolio  which comprised of our total portfolio at fair value at december   and includes only investment grade securities 
during the last year our strategy has included increasing our positions in tax exempt fixed maturities in an effort to maximize after tax investment income in conjunction with diversifying into additional asset classes  such as treasury inflation protected securities 
our only investments in asset backed securities are in federal agency pools and government guaranteed gnmas 
our internally managed equity portfolio  which comprised approximately at fair value of our total portfolio at december   emphasizes large cap  dividend paying companies selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
during the fourth quarter   we began to diversify our equity portfolio  and utilize outside managers to invest in us small cap equities and international instruments 
by diversifying  we hope to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
loss reserves we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
loss reserves are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to claimants  based on facts  circumstances and historical trends then known 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
we do not discount loss reserves for financial statement purposes 
our objective is to set reserves that are adequate such that the amounts that we originally record as reserves reasonably approximate the ultimate liability for insured losses and loss expenses 
we then periodically review and adjust loss reserves on a timely basis 
catastrophic events we are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
catastrophe losses can and do cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and fires  none of which are within our control 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a 
table of contents catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
many catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas 
however  hurricanes  earthquakes and other perils may produce significant damage in larger areas  especially those that are heavily populated 
although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty lines  most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners  other personal lines  allied lines and commercial multiple peril coverages 
we deploy specific strategies designed to mitigate our exposure to catastrophe losses  which include obtaining reinsurance 
we continually seek to diversify our business on a geographic basis 
the number of states we operate in has increased from states in to states as of january  as we begin  the concentration of our direct written premiums for our property and casualty operations in our largest state  ohio  has decreased from for the year ended december   to approximately at january  our underwriting guidelines are designed to limit exposures to high risk insurance matters such as asbestos and environmental claims 
our catastrophe management strategies are designed to mitigate our exposure to earthquakes and hurricanes 
in addition to our adherence to our cost based pricing  investment and risk mitigation strategies discussed above  our management focuses on several other key areas with the intention of continually improving the results of our operations and financial results  including the following claims service we believe an important element of our success is our focus on claims service 
we expect our claim service to be fair  fast and friendly 
the role of the claims division is to deliver the promise that we and the independent agent made to the insured 
we have the capability of receiving claims hours a day  seven days a week 
claims may be reported to our claims contact center  to the policyholder s independent agent or via the internet 
we make a pledge to our policyholders to try and make contact with them within two hours of a claim being assigned to a claims handler except in catastrophe loss situations 
in  we established claims catastrophe teams to enhance our response to policyholders in catastrophe loss situations 
independent insurance agent network we offer our products through over  agencies in states 
we believe the success of our independent insurance agent network  which is our only distribution channel  grows out of our commitment to promote and foster close working relationships with our agents 
we seek relationships with agencies where we will be one of their top three insurers  measured on the basis of direct premiums written  for the type of business we desire 
our agents compensation package includes competitive commission rates and other sales inducements designed to maintain and enhance relationships with existing independent agents as well as to attract new independent agents 
we provide our agents with a co operative advertising program  sales training programs  contingent commissions  travel incentives and agency recognition 
we continually monitor our agencies for compatibility with us  taking into account factors such as loss ratio  premium volume  business profiles and relationship history 
this allows us to be proactive in helping our agents grow their book of business with us profitably and  thus  enhance the long term value of our relationship 
our senior management meets frequently with agents to encourage mutual growth and demonstrate our commitment 
we believe each of these elements creates a relationship that has resulted in our independent insurance agents placing quality insurance business with us 
technology our technology efforts are focused on making us as efficient and effective as possible 
in  our personal insurance segment technology leveraged past successes with our netxpress agency portal by putting emphasis on the integration between various third party technologies and netxpress 
one such example was adding functionality to bridge data directly into our netxpress portal from comparative rating tools thus eliminating the re keying effort and increasing the data quality level 
agency personnel have welcomed this functionality and rewarded us with increased quote opportunities and submissions 
it has also positioned us to be more effective on book rollover opportunities 
other integration examples include agency management systems and services that dynamically order underwriting products like motor vehicle reports  credit reports  and geographic data used in our pricing algorithms 

table of contents our business insurance segment benefited by the introduction of our bizxpress sm portal 
the bizxpress sm portal was deployed in all of our states of operation except florida in during the course of  several disciplines were more effectively used in our technology efforts 
quality assurance practices were formalized and used resulting in less defects in applications once deployed 
additionally  more project management rigor and application governance allowed our project delivery to be more predictable for all business segments 
finally  we implemented performance testing tools and application monitoring technologies so we can increase our responsiveness and operate our information systems infrastructure efficiently 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in this item we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
investments our fixed maturity  equity security and certain other invested asset investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment that requires significant management judgment 
among the factors we consider are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  overall market conditions and our intent and ability to hold securities until the value recovers 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
for a further discussion regarding our investments see compared to and compared to included in this item deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
these amounts are based on estimates  and accordingly  the actual realizable value may vary from the estimated realizable value 
losses and loss expenses payable losses and loss expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what we expect to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 

table of contents the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported ibnr are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
the process for calculating ibnr is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses incurred  and then subtract all amounts already paid or held in tabular case reserves 
although we use many internal and external resources  as well as multiple established methodologies to calculate ibnr  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
for a further discussion regarding our losses and loss expense reserves and our reserving methods see other loss and loss expense reserves included in this item pension and postretirement benefit obligations pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management s judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
we review these factors annually  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because these obligations are based on estimates which could change  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 
for a further discussion regarding our pension and postretirement benefit obligations see other employee benefit plans included in this item share based compensation we have share based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options  restricted stock and restricted share units to employees and non employee directors and agents 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant or each reporting date and amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant or each reporting date using the black scholes closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the option and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life of the option  which significantly impacts the assumed fair value 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future periods 
other other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in item a of this form k under risk factors 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 

table of contents results of operations summary the following table summarizes certain key performance indicators used to manage our operations for the years ended december   and  respectively millions  except per share data gaap basis total revenues net income stockholders equity book value per share loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio catastrophe loss and lae points premium written growth premium earned growth investment yield sap basis loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio net premiums written to surplus at december   accumulated comprehensive income was reduced by million and book value per share was reduced by  respectively  in connection with the initial adoption of sfas defined below at december  for a further discussion of the impact of sfas  see other employee benefit plans included in this item see compared to section below for definitions 
points of the increase for related to the million of unearned premiums transferred to us in connection with the addition of the meridian security and meridian citizens mutual to the pooling arrangement 
sap loss and lae ratio is statutory losses and loss expenses as a percentage of net earned premium 
sap expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses and miscellaneous expenses offset by miscellaneous income underwriting expenses as a percentage of net written premiums 
sap combined ratio is the sum of the sap loss and lae ratio and the sap expense ratio 
we use the statutory net premiums written to surplus ratio because there is no comparable gaap measure 
this ratio  also called the leverage ratio  measures our statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
compared to income before federal income tax decreased million to million from the most significant factors contributing to this decrease related to a decline in our revenues  specifically our premiums  and an increase in our loss and loss expenses 
our gaap loss and loss expense ratio for was compared to in insurance segments insurance industry regulators require our insurance subsidiaries to report their financial condition and results of operations using sap 
we use sap financial results  along with industry standard financial measures determined on a sap basis and certain measures determined on a gaap basis  to internally monitor the performance of our insurance segments and reward our employees 
the more common financial measures used are loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio  combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
when the 
table of contents combined ratio is less than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting gain and when it is greater than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting loss 
underwriting gain loss is determined by subtracting from net earned premiums  losses and loss expenses and underwriting expenses 
one of the more significant differences between gaap and sap is that sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the periods the related written premiums are earned 
for a discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs included in this form k 
the gaap combined ratio is defined as the sum of the gaap loss and lae ratio loss and loss expenses as a percentage of earned premiums plus gaap expense ratio acquisition and operating expenses as a percentage of earned premiums 
all references to financial measures or components thereof in this discussion are calculated on a gaap basis  unless otherwise noted

net written premiums provide us with an indication of how well we are doing in terms of revenue growth before it is actually earned 
our policies provide a fixed amount of coverage for a stated period of time  often referred to as the policy term 
as such  our written premiums are recognized as earned ratably over the policy term 
the unearned portion of written premiums  called unearned premiums  is reflected on our balance sheet as a liability and represents our obligation to provide coverage for the unexpired terms of the policy 
personal insurance segment revenue our personal insurance segment consists primarily of auto standard and nonstandard and homeowners products  with personal auto representing approximately of our total consolidated net written premium in

while a modest increase  it does represent an improvement from which declined approximately from in particular  competition remains intense within the personal auto market  which is contributing to our overall modest growth 
it remains our strategy that rates be risk based  reflecting the underlying loss and expense trends 
net written premiums for our standard auto products decreased in compared to the competitive marketplace combined with some rate reductions in contributed to this result 
however  we have seen increasing new business production related to the introduction of our customfit sm product into new states 
customfit sm uses a multi variate rating approach that broadens the underwriting eligibility for new customers 
in  we began introducing the second generation of customfit sm  which further improves our rating sophistication 
net written premiums for nonstandard personal auto increased in compared this represents a significant improvement compared to the premium result which declined from targeted rate decreases coupled with the introduction of new discounts and an increased marketing effort contributed to an increased level of new policy submissions leading to an increase in premiums 
we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
during  we introduced in states various real time comparative rating tools which can be used by our independent agents to prepare comparative rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information once 
we believe our independent agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process 
homeowners net written premium increased in compared to in  we introduced a home purchase discount and expanded our age of dwelling discounts to help attract new business which we believe contributed favorably to increased new homeowners policy submission levels 
during  we continued to enhance our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress  by adding several new integration options with a variety of third party tools used by our independent agents including a 
table of contents joint credit ordering tool  integrated report ordering  and the comparative rating tools mentioned above 
we also have added a number of internal integration points through the use of web services technology 
one example of this is real time integration with our enterprise billing system to provide accurate installment information via netxpress tm 
the goal of these technology investments is to streamline quoting and policy issuance for our agents 
we strive to be their carrier of choice and ease of doing business is a major driver toward that goal 
we have also focused on improving our policyholders ease of doing business with respect to bill payment and claim reporting and settlement 
in  we expanded our premium payment options to include credit and debit card via www 
stateauto 
com 
in  we deployed an interactive voice response ivr solution to accept premium payments over the phone providing yet another option for policyholders 
the ivr solution provides a more efficient business process for our payment services department and is expected to drive better policy retention results 
during  nearly  payments were made through self service technologies such as these representing over million of premium payments 
additionally  we recently completed several strategic initiatives to enhance our claims handling ability and better manage major catastrophes 
field claims personnel are now equipped with mobile devices that permit adjusting property claims at the loss site 
we believe that our professional claims service backed by reliable technology will continue to distinguish us from our competitors 
during the second quarter  we filed an application with the florida department of insurance to withdraw from the state s personal lines insurance market effective january  after a careful analysis of recent regulatory changes in florida  we concluded that we could no longer operate our personal lines on a profitable basis in that state 
non renewals on this business are in process 
we will continue to write commercial lines business in florida 
during  we wrote million of personal lines premium in florida 
business insurance segment revenue we focus our business insurance sales on small to medium sized exposures and offer a broad range of both property and liability coverages such as commercial auto  commercial multi peril  fire and allied lines  products liability and workers compensation

table of contents the business insurance segment net written premium for decreased from business insurance continues to be impacted by rate competition and ease of doing business issues 
we are seeking to balance our traditional underwriting discipline with new products and pricing tools that support the production of profitable new business 
in  we began offering our business products in two new states colorado and texas and increased the number of business products offered in arizona 
we also continue to enhance our back office systems which enable us to more effectively support our independent agents 
we recently implemented the technology to provide real time functionality in our business insurance policy administration systems for quote and issuance transactions 
also known as straight through processing stp  our associates are now able to more effectively and accurately handle typical business insurance processing 
the policy service time has been greatly reduced as a result of this new technology 
to make it easier for our agents to submit business insurance accounts  in  we introduced bizxpress sm  our web based quote and issuance system  to agents in all of our operating states except florida 
we currently utilize bizxpress sm for businessowners policies 
we are working to expand bizxpress sm functionality to our business auto products in the first half of  while we develop the same functionality for workers compensation business for introduction at a later date 
this has been a highly collaborative initiative that has included agent focus group input throughout the project lifecycle 
it also leverages the stp technology investment mentioned above 
we believe this technology investment should better position us for revenue growth opportunities in the future and start to drive efficiencies into our business model much like we have seen in personal insurance 
losses and expenses our gaap loss and lae ratio was in compared to in loss results for the year have been mixed 
our core auto personal and business and other and product liability lines continue to perform well 
on the property side  catastrophe losses for were lower than in  but we experienced significantly higher frequency of large fire losses within our personal and business lines during losses and loss expenses for a calendar year represent the combined estimated ultimate liability for claims occurring in the current calendar year along with development of claims occurring in prior years 
the following table presents the provision for losses and loss expenses for those claims occurring in the current calendar year and prior years  along with the gaap loss and lae ratio for the years and  respectively millions gaap loss and lae gaap loss and lae provision for losses and loss expenses occurring current year prior years total losses and loss expenses 
table of contents a tabular presentation of the million favorable development broken down by accident year is shown below 
millions accident year current year development of ultimate liability redundancy deficiency and prior total normal fluctuations and uncertainty associated with loss reserve development and claim settlement contributed to favorable development in the respective calendar years 
the favorable development of million in came primarily from accident years the more notable items contributing to the development are favorable development at the product level is primarily from the auto liability and other liability lines  where current loss projections using more mature claim data resulted in lower expected average claim severities than past projections 
the impact is approximately million for these two lines combined 
adjusting and other expense reserves accounted for approximately million of prior year reserve change 
these expense reserves have a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in relation to carried loss reserves 
since reserves decreased for the prior accident years  the expense reserves declined in a similar fashion 
allocated loss adjustment expenses alae are those costs that can be related to a specific claim  which may include attorney fees  external claims adjusters and investigation costs  among others 
unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae are those costs incurred in settling claims  such as in house processing costs  for which no identification can be made to specific claims 
adjusting and other expenses are the components of alae and ulae that relate to costs other than defense  litigation  and medical cost containment 
we hold ceded loss reserves in anticipation of transferring liabilities to reinsurers and other pools and associations 
ceded loss reserves were above previously anticipated levels by approximately million 
historically  we have had less ceded loss activity because our reinsurance retention levels are generally high enough to exclude most claims 
this favorable development occurred primarily in the fire  auto liability and workers compensation lines 
favorable catastrophe loss development of approximately million is attributable to the accident year 
this development occurred primarily within our homeowners  other personal and commercial multi peril lines of business 
the remaining favorable development is spread across several lines of business and is generally the result of having fewer claims emerge and lower claim severity than anticipated in the estimates developed as of december

see additional discussion regarding loss and loss expense reserves at the other loss and loss expense reserves section included herein 
catastrophe losses in totaled million loss ratio points compared to million loss ratio points in during  our catastrophe losses resulted primarily from wind and hail in several midwestern states and mostly impacted our homeowners business 
catastrophe activity in had a significant impact on both our personal and business insurance property lines 
the discussion of catastrophe losses includes those which have been designated as such by iso s property claim services pcs unit  a nationally recognized industry service 
pcs defines catastrophes as events resulting in million or more in insured losses industry wide and affecting significant numbers of insureds and insurers

excluding the impact of catastrophes  the personal lines loss ratio in was points higher than in period 
the increase in both the standard and nonstandard auto loss ratios can be attributed partially to rate reductions taken in and the improvement in the homeowners loss ratio can be attributed primarily to the reduction of catastrophe losses 
in  catastrophes added points to the homeowners loss ratio compared to points in period 
the business insurance segment s loss ratio for was points higher than in catastrophes accounted for loss ratio points in compared to points in excluding the impact of catastrophes  the business lines loss ratio in was points higher than in the overall increase reflects rate reductions in premium per exposure on business written in and and an increase in the number of large property losses 
workers compensation  which represents approximately of our business insurance portfolio and less than of our overall insurance segment portfolio  tends to be a more volatile line of business due to its size and risks written 
we do not write mono line workers compensation  but make our product available as part of the business package policy 
the increase in the level of losses as compared to was driven largely by an increase in severity rather than frequency 
we regularly monitor frequency and 
table of contents severity trends  as well as the overall construction of our workers compensation book of business 
in addition  we promote the writing of the low hazard risk types that have developed a consistent pattern of profitability 
acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums gaap expense ratio were in compared to in the expense ratio was largely impacted by a lower premium base in compared to investment operations segment our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of state auto mutual  and its subsidiaries and affiliates are managed by our subsidiary  stateco 
the investment committee of the board of directors of each of our insurers sets investment policies to be followed by stateco 
at december   our investments in fixed maturities  equity securities and certain other invested assets were held as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
our primary investment objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and expenses 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   we had no fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade 
our only investments in asset backed securities are in federal agency pools and government guaranteed gnmas 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
during the fourth quarter  we began to diversify our equity portfolio and utilize outside money managers to invest in us small cap equities and international instruments 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside money managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us  however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
by further diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international instruments  we hope to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 

table of contents in august  we completed a portfolio diversification study with the objective to reduce the volatility of the returns and improve our overall after tax return while continuing to maintain a high quality portfolio 
based on this study  the committee defined below approved the following target asset allocation cash and cash equivalents core fixed maturities treasury inflation protected securities large cap equities small cap equities international instruments total portfolio composition of investment portfolio beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began investing funds as they became available moving toward our targeted asset allocations over the next to months 
the following table provides a breakdown of our investments relative to our targeted allocated percentages provided above at december  we measure our investment portfolio allocation with fixed maturities at amortized cost and equities and international instruments at fair value 
millions of total cash and cash equivalents core fixed maturities treasury inflation protected securities large cap equities small cap equities international instruments other invested assets total portfolio the following table provides the composition of our available for sale investment portfolio at december  and  respectively millions fixed maturities equity securities other invested assets total investments  at fair value 
table of contents the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturities at december   by contractual maturity  are as follows millions amortized cost fair value due in year or less due after year through years due after years through years due after years us government agencies mortgage backed securities total expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities as the issuers may have the right to call or prepay the obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions were equal to approximately of the equity portfolio 
our equity portfolio consists primarily of large cap  value oriented stocks with a small allocation to small cap equities 
therefore  when large cap stocks and or value oriented stocks perform well our equity portfolio typically performs well compared to benchmarks 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap stocks  our equity portfolio does not perform as well compared to benchmarks 
this is due to the significant overweighting in large cap  value oriented stocks versus small cap and growth stocks in the portfolio

this reallocation effort would result in lower pre tax investment yields but higher after tax investment income than if we had continued under the then current allocation percentages 
in november  the committee approved a million repositioning of the then current taxable and tax exempt holdings to reach our targeted percentage at a quicker pace than if we just used new monies 
based 
table of contents on this action  the sale of approximately million of taxable securities was completed by december  reinvestment into tax exempt securities of the proceeds from these actions was completed during the first quarter during the committee s march meeting  the allocation status was reviewed and the committee approved an additional million repositioning of the then current taxable and tax exempt holdings 
based on this action  the sale of approximately million of taxable securities was completed by march  reinvestment into tax exempt securities of the proceeds from these actions was completed during the second quarter 
after completion of the targeted rebalancing  we assessed the securities held and confirmed our intent to hold the remaining securities until either recovery of fair value or maturity 
market risk our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment instruments  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed maturity investments 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk whereby the value of the securities varies as market interest rates change 
we manage this risk by closely monitoring the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk and shows the effects of a parallel change in interest rates on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio excluding other debt securities as of december  fair value millions change in interest rates bps value as of original value this table summarizes only the effects that a parallel change in interest rates could have on the fixed maturity portfolio 
this change in rates would also change the value of our liabilities and possibly other financial assets 
we caution the reader that this analysis does not take into account nonparallel changes in interest rates 
it is likely that some rates would increase or decrease more than others depending upon market conditions at the time of the change 
this nonparallel change would alter the value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the analysis is also limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in interest rates and the resulting fixed maturity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
we believe that the fixed maturity portfolio s exposure to credit risk is minimal as greater than of the bonds we own are rated aa or better and the remaining bonds are rated a 
we do not intend to change our investment policy on the quality of our fixed maturity investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio is managed in a laddered maturity style and considers business mix and liability payout patterns to ensure adequate cash flow to meet claims as they are presented 
we also manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances  owning some agency and us treasury securities at all times  purchasing bonds of major issuers  and purchasing bonds that are part of a medium or large issue 
the fixed maturity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either exchange rate risk or commodity risk 
we do not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide us greater flexibility in order to manage our market risk exposures  we categorize our fixed maturities as available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
we have no asset backed securities in our fixed maturity portfolio which may be labeled sub prime mortgage backed securities 
we only invest in conventional mortgage backed securities issued by a federal agency or that are us government guaranteed 
specifically  our only investment in asset backed securities approximately million or of our available for sale 
table of contents investment portfolio are in federal agency pool and government guaranteed gnmas  of which are gnmas  which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
our fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous municipalities with a total carrying value of  million 
approximately million or of these securities were enhanced by third party insurance the credit enhancement for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
such insurance generally results in a rating of aaa being assigned by independent ratings agencies to those securities 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities could result in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities from aaa to the underlying rating of the respective security without giving effect to the benefit of the credit enhancement 
credit enhancement is not a primary consideration to us when purchasing a municipality security as we consider the underlying credit rating of the security by moody s and s p as a more important factor in our evaluation process 
of the total million of insured municipal securities in our investment portfolio  approximately were rated aa or better  without the benefit of a credit enhancement 
we do not believe that a loss of a credit enhancement would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities 
as of december   our large cap equity portfolio had a beta of using the s p index as a benchmark 
beta estimates the degree the portfolio s price will fluctuate based on a given movement in the market index 
the table below reflects what changes might occur in the value of the large cap equity portfolio given a change in the s p index fair value millions change in s p index value as of original value the above analysis is limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in equity market prices and the resulting equity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
by investing in mostly large cap issues we hope to limit liquidity risk in the equity portfolio 
the equity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to exchange rate risk since we do not directly hold any foreign stocks 
we constantly monitor the equity portfolio holdings for any credit risk issues that may arise 
we do not invest in any commodity futures or commodity oriented mutual funds 

table of contents investment operations revenue net investment income for was million compared to million in in our average invested assets increased due to our insurance segments favorable underwriting cash flows 
however  our pre tax return on investments declined slightly as provided in the table below due largely to rebalancing our fixed maturity portfolio as described above toward tax exempt bonds  which have a lower yield on a pre tax basis 
after tax  our net investment income for was million effective tax rate compared to million effective tax rate for millions year ended december gross investment income fixed maturities equity securities other total gross investment income less investment expenses net investment income average invested assets at cost annualized investment yield annualized investment yield  after tax realized gains and losses on investments for the years ended december  and  respectively are summarized as follows millions realized gains losses proceeds received on sale realized gains losses proceeds received on sale realized gains fixed maturities equity securities total realized gains realized losses fixed maturities equity securities total realized losses net realized gains on investments most of the realized gains in were derived from the equity segment of the portfolio 
equity sales were executed for various reasons  including the achievement of our price target and raising funds within two of our insurance subsidiaries to fund cash dividends to state auto financial 
see other capital transactions section below 
the realized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio were achieved by selling shorter term tax exempt securities and subsequently reinvesting those funds into longer term tax exempt securities as well as selling taxable securities to reinvest the proceeds into the tax exempt securities as described above 
for the year ended december   realized losses of million on the fixed maturities related primarily to selling taxable securities to support our shift into tax exempt securities 
realized losses of million on equity securities related primarily to the sale of equity positions where changes in government policy or business conditions  in our opinion  greatly diminished future business prospects 

table of contents we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment which requires significant management judgment 
among the factors considered by management are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  overall market conditions  and our intent and ability to hold securities until recovery 
when a security in our investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   we recognized million other than temporary impairments compared to million for the same period 
during we recognized no other than temporary impairments on our fixed maturity portfolio  however  we recognized million in realized losses related to other than temporary impairments within our equity portfolio 
of the million in realized losses  million related to two equity positions within the consumer cyclical sector impacted by the downturn in the housing industry 
the remaining million in realized losses was limited to our externally managed us small cap portfolio for which we were unable to make the assertion regarding our intent to hold particular securities that were currently valued below cost until recovery in the near term 
the other than temporary impairments recognized in were limited to these securities  based on specific facts and judgments related to these particular issuers 
the write downs related primarily to our investment in certain subordinate income notes and principal protected units representing purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
we reduced the estimate of future cash flows we expected to receive from these securities in light of actual default rates of the underlying collateral securities exceeding the assumed defaults 
gross unrealized investment gains and losses a review of our investment portfolio at december  determined there were no individual investments with an unrealized loss that had a fair value significantly below cost continually for more than one year 
there were also no individual material securities with an unrealized holding loss at december  the following table provides detailed information on our available for sale investment portfolio for our gross unrealized gains and losses at december  millions  except number of positions investment category cost or amortized cost gross unrealized holding gains number of gain positions gross unrealized holding losses number of loss positions fair value fixed maturities us treasury securities states and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities of us gov

table of contents other income statement items interest expense on our debt was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is largely affected by the amount of underwriting profit or loss and net realized investment gains or losses that are taxed at approximately relative to the amount of net investment income at its effective tax rate 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was compared to for the same period 
as previously discussed  the effective tax rate on net investment income declined to for versus for compared to income before federal income taxes decreased million to million in from the most significant factors contributing to this decrease relate to a decline in our revenues  specifically our premiums  an increased level of catastrophe losses and the recognition of share based compensation expenses beginning in catastrophe losses in were million compared to million in share based compensation expense  which we began to recognize in  was million

standard personal auto  which accounts for of our book of business  continues to be our most profitable line of business 
as a result of the competitive market  we reduced our rates approximately during in order to remain competitive without significantly compromising our profitability 
we continue to focus on attracting new business to our standard personal auto line of business 
the primary product contributing to new business in standard personal auto is our customfit sm product which uses a multi variate rating approach that broadens the underwriting and eligibility guidelines for new customers 
having price points for a larger percentage of the personal lines market is expected to improve new business opportunities 
as of the end of  we had implemented customfit sm in states  which represented approximately of our standard personal auto written premium volume 
since introducing customfit sm in december  we have seen a significant improvement in our net written premium production trend for new business 
net written premiums in nonstandard personal auto decreased million in however  nonstandard personal auto is beginning to stabilize  in the fourth quarter of  new business increased compared to the same period in the impact of target rate decreases coupled with the introduction of new discounts has produced what appears to be an improving premium situation 
the personal auto market appears to be changing quickly and dramatically 
many companies are moving to a single auto product such as our customfit sm which can accommodate most personal auto risks 
as a result  the delineation between standard and nonstandard auto insurance is becoming blurred 
the new auto programs accepting a broader range of risks has limited and is expected to continue to limit the nonstandard auto market for us and other insurers 

table of contents we believe independent agents value ease of doing business and make it an important factor in their choice of insurance companies when quoting personal auto products to their customers 
to assist in this area  in  we entered into agreements with two major comparative rating companies 
these companies products allow agents to receive rate quotes from multiple insurance companies by entering the rating information only one time 
we worked diligently in the fourth quarter with these two vendors with a launch date for implementation expected in early we believe agents will quote and write more personal standard and nonstandard auto with us as a result of a more efficient quoting process combined with more competitive rates resulting from the ongoing introduction of customfit sm for standard auto and new policy discounts introduced in for nonstandard auto 
homeowners net written premium grew in we are undertaking new homeowners pricing and product initiatives  such as a new home purchase discount and an expanded new home discount that will complement our customfit sm rollout and should position us well for the future 
the competitive pressures that have impacted personal auto have also extended to homeowners 
in general  our homeowner rate level was impacted due to downward rate changes 
during  we enhanced our personal lines point of sale portal  netxpress sm 
this is the system our agencies use to send us business electronically 
we now have real time  on line information access capabilities that streamline the new business quote and issue process 
approximately of our personal auto and homeowner lines new business was submitted electronically in compared to in in addition in  of all personal auto and homeowner lines policy changes came to us electronically from agents

table of contents our business insurance book of business continues to be impacted by rate competition as well as ease of doing business issues 
commercial auto net written premiums decreased in however  commercial multi peril and workers compensation net written premiums reflected positive growth 
in general  during the overall impact to net written premiums from business insurance line rate changes was a slight decrease 
we are pursuing initiatives that we anticipate will generate additional business insurance premium production over the long term 
one of our current strategic priorities is to develop a web based rating system for the three products that generate the most new business submissions 
in addition  we are developing more sophisticated pricing models to further segment our business insurance accounts  which we anticipate will improve our growth opportunities while still achieving our profit targets 
we are also emphasizing a total account underwriting approach in which we offer additional products to our existing accounts 
we are developing product enhancements that we believe will result in increased sales while pursuing process efficiencies to deliver product and pricing developments to the market more quickly 
during  we focused on introducing a more marketable pricing structure without forfeiting underwriting profits 
finally  we increased field underwriting authority which quickens our response to our agents 
for both our personal and business products  we continue to emphasize that we will not compromise underwriting profitability for top line growth 
we believe that we can implement periodic rate changes in most states and remain an attractive market to our policyholders and independent agents by stressing the strengths we bring to the marketplace 
these strengths include stability  financial soundness  prompt and fair claims service  and user friendly technology which help agents do business with us and provide substantial value to our customers 
losses and expenses our gaap loss and lae ratios were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our auto and liability lines produced better loss results during while the property lines deteriorated due mostly to catastrophes 
our personal and commercial auto lines continued to produce favorable gaap loss and lae ratios benefiting from a combination of cumulative rate changes taken over the past several years along with improvement in claim frequency and severity 
the following table presents the provision for losses and loss expenses for those claims occurring in the current calendar year and prior years  along with the gaap loss and lae ratio for the years and  respectively millions gaap loss and lae gaap loss and lae provision for losses and loss expenses occurring current year prior years total losses and loss expenses 
table of contents a tabular presentation of the million favorable development broken down by accident year is shown below 
millions accident year current year development of ultimate liability redundancy deficiency and prior total normal fluctuations and uncertainty associated with loss reserve development and claim settlement contributed to favorable development in the respective calendar years 
the favorable development of million in came primarily from accident years the following are the notable items contributing to the development we hold ceded loss reserves in anticipation of transferring liabilities to reinsurers and other pools and associations 
in  ceded loss reserves developed favorably by million  meaning the actual ceded losses were above anticipated levels 
historically  we have had less ceded loss activity because our reinsurance retention levels are generally high enough to exclude most claims 
this favorable development occurred primarily in the auto and commercial multi peril lines 
favorable development at the product level is primarily from the personal auto and commercial auto liability lines  where current loss projections using more mature claim data resulted in lower expected average claim severities than past projections 
the impact is million for these two lines combined 
adjusting and other expense reserves accounted for approximately million of prior year reserve change 
these expense reserves have a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in relation to carried loss reserves 
since reserves decreased for the prior accident years  the expense reserves declined in a similar fashion 
the remaining favorable development is spread across several lines of business and is generally the result of having fewer claims emerge and lower claim severity  than anticipated in the estimates developed as of december

as of january   we began recognizing compensation expense associated with share based awards granted to employees and non employee directors within our financial statements in accordance with sfas r 
consequently  our expenses include additional share based awards of million associated with the adoption of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for these awards in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no

we adopted the guidance provided by sfas r under the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense in includes the portion vesting in the period for all share based awards granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r

this expense is expected to be recognized as follows million in  million in  and million in unearned share based compensation is amortized over the vesting period for the particular grant and is recognized as a component of loss and loss adjustment expenses and acquisition and operating expenses in a manner consistent with other employee compensation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 

table of contents the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the option and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life of the option  which significantly impacts the assumed fair value 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future periods 
the gaap expense ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our expense ratio is due in part to lower premiums in compared to  expenses associated with share based awards under sfas r see previous discussion above  as well as expenses related to our incentive programs  both agency and employee 
these incentive programs are directly related to our loss experience 
we do not anticipate meaningful reductions in our expense ratio during as it relates to our incentive compensation programs as well as our investment in new technologies and products as we position ourselves to be more competitive in the market place

in and part of  we participated in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturity and equity securities from our investment portfolio were loaned to other institutions for short periods of time 
we required collateral  equal to of the market value of the loaned securities 
the collateral was invested by the lending agent  in accordance with our guidelines  generating investment income  net of applicable fees 
we accounted for this program as a secured borrowing and recorded the collateral held and corresponding liability to return the collateral on our balance sheet 
during the second quarter of  we terminated our participation in

we manage our equity portfolio by investing in a large  but manageable  number of stocks from many different industries 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the equity portfolio 
we invest only in stocks that currently pay a dividend 
as of december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different stocks

for  the effective tax rate was compared to for as previously discussed  the effective tax rate on net investment income has declined to in compared to in  primarily due to increasing our tax exempt municipal bond holdings throughout liquidity and capital resources general liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for both long term and short term cash obligations as they come due 
our significant sources of cash are premiums  investment income  investment sales and the maturity of fixed security investments  as well as funds available under our credit facility as defined below 
the significant outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt and investment purchases 
the cash outflows can vary due to uncertainties regarding settlement of large losses or catastrophe events 
as a result  we continually monitor our investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they 
table of contents are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the immediate availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents  and  million and  million  respectively  of total available for sale investments at fair value 
in addition  substantially all of our fixed maturity and equity securities are traded on public markets 
for a further discussion regarding investments see investments operations segment included in this item our insurance subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met 
however  because the stfc pooled companies participate in the pooling arrangement  they do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company 
this is due to the fact that  under the terms of the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the pool participants and then settles the intercompany balances generated by these transactions with the participating companies within days following each quarter end 
when settling the intercompany balances  state auto mutual provides the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written and net losses paid during the quarter and retains all receivable amounts from insureds and agents and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unaffiliated reinsurers 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by state auto mutual and allocated to the pool member on the basis of pool participation 
as a result  we have an off balance sheet credit risk related to the balances due to state auto mutual from insureds  agents and reinsurers  which are offset by the unearned premium from the respective policies 
while the total amount due to state auto mutual from policyholders and agents is significant  the individual amounts due are relatively small at the policyholder and agency level 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to our financial position  though the impact to income on a quarterly basis may be material 
the state auto group mitigates its exposure to this credit risk through its in house collections unit for both personal and commercial accounts which is supplemented by third party collection service providers 
the amounts deemed uncollectible by state auto mutual and allocated to the stfc pooled companies are included in other expenses in the accompanying statements of income 
the state auto group s reliance on ceded reinsurance is not significant in comparison to the state auto group s total statutory surplus or our total financial position 
to minimize the risk of reinsurer default  the state auto group cedes only to third party reinsurers who are rated a or better by am best and also utilizes both domestic and international markets to diversify its credit risk 
we utilize reinsurance to limit our loss exposure and contribute to our liquidity and capital resources 
for a discussion of our reinsurance arrangements  see reinsurance arrangements included in this item net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the significant sources of operating cash flows are derived from underwriting operations and investment income 
the positive cash flows over the three year period is largely due to favorable underwriting and investment income cash flows  offset by increases in cash paid on estimated federal income taxes  interest expense and cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan 
cash from operations in increased million over primarily due to a reduction in claim payments from a lower level of catastrophe losses in compared to offset partially by an increase in taxes paid 
cash from operations for decreased from due to our decline in net written premiums as previously discussed along with an increase in the amount of loss and loss expenses paid from the increased level of catastrophe losses between the two years 
in addition  benefited from the million received by the stfc pooled companies in connection with adding meridian security and meridian citizens mutual to the pooling arrangement 
over the last three years  operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet our operating needs while providing increased opportunities for investment 
however  should our written premium decline or paid losses increase significantly our cash flows from operations could be impacted requiring us to liquidate investments 

table of contents during  and  as permitted by regulations of the internal revenue service  we made cash contributions of million  million and million  respectively  to our defined benefit pension plan on behalf of our employees 
the actuarially determined contribution to our defined benefit pension plan ranges from the minimum amount we would be required to contribute to the maximum amount that would be tax deductible 
amounts contributed in excess of the minimum are deemed voluntary while amounts in excess of the maximum would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible for tax purposes 
amounts paid in each of these three years were within the minimum and maximum funding amounts that would be deductible for tax purposes 
the actuarially determined funding amount to the pension plan is generally not determined until the second quarter with respect to the contribution year  though we currently expect to make a cash contribution to our defined benefit pension plan of approximately million during for a further discussion regarding our defined benefit pension plan see employee benefit plans included in this item net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in versus is principally the result of a greater amount of cash and cash equivalents available to invest at the beginning of versus million in compared to million in  an increase in the level of cash provided from operations between the two years

the cash transfer of dividends was completed in october other events on february   we issued a press release announcing preliminary estimates of catastrophe storm activity through february  this press release disclosed our expectation that first quarter earnings will include between and million in pre tax catastrophe losses related to unusual january and early february storm activity 
severe wind and tornado activity which impacted the midwest during the first five weeks of this year are expected to contribute significantly more losses to our first quarter results than are normal 
over the past five years  we have experienced an average of million in catastrophe losses during the first quarter 
we reported million in catastrophe losses for the first quarter of while the january and february catastrophe storm losses will be significant to our first quarter results  we do not expect these losses to have a significant impact on our overall financial position

reinsurance arrangements members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 

table of contents during  the beacon group was added to the state auto group s reinsurance programs described below and as of january   the patrons group was added to these reinsurance programs 
the terms of the casualty excess of loss program provide that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of a covered loss 
coverage under the casualty excess of loss program was expanded as of july   so that reinsurers became responsible for of a covered loss in excess of million  up to million of covered loss  compared to under the previous program 
also  certain unusual claim situations involving bodily injury liability  property damage  uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are covered by an arrangement that provides for million of coverage in excess of million retention for each loss occurrence 
this layer of reinsurance sits above the million excess of million arrangement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
under our property per risk excess of loss program  each company within the our state auto group is responsible for the first million of each covered loss and reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over the retention up to million of covered losses 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
under our property catastrophe excess of loss program  the state auto group retains the first million of catastrophe loss per occurrence 
outside reinsures provide coverage for the next million of covered loss with a co participation 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
we also participate in an intercompany catastrophe reinsurance agreement by which state auto p c acts as the catastrophe reinsurer for the state auto group 
the coverage attaches at million of catastrophe loss per occurrence 
excess of the million retention  this program continues to provide coverage for the next million of covered loss 
there have been no losses assumed under this agreement 
the state auto group does not currently intend to renew this intercompany catastrophe reinsurance arrangement upon its expiration on july  the state auto group is considering other alternatives  which include securing replacement coverage from a third party reinsurer or relying upon the million set aside under the credit agreement  discussed above  to fund this layer of catastrophe reinsurance 
in addition to the treaties described above  the state auto group is also party to treaties for workers compensation excess of loss and workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss 
the terms of the workers compensation excess of loss program provide that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
net retentions under this contract may be submitted to the casualty excess of loss program  subject to a limit of million per loss occurrence 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss treaty provides an additional layer of excess of loss reinsurance for workers compensation losses involving multiple workers 
subject to million of retention  reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
this coverage is subject to a maximum any one life limit of million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the state auto group has also secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage and certain companies 
included are umbrella liability losses which are reinsured up to a limit of million with a maximum million retention 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations and participates in involuntary pools and associations in certain states 
facultative reinsurance provides for a separate reinsurance agreement that is negotiated for a particular risk or insurance policy

regulatory considerations at december   and  each of our insurance subsidiaries was in compliance with statutory requirements relating to capital adequacy 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the 
table of contents financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that are known in the insurance industry as the iris ratios 
iris ratios are derived from financial statements prepared on a statutory accounting basis  which are accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department with regulatory authority over our insurance subsidiaries 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring our insurance companies operating performance on a statutory accounting basis each of our insurance subsidiaries operates within the defined range for the other measures  the net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of our insurance subsidiaries continue to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
the statutory leverage ratios for our insurance subsidiaries at december   and were as follows statutory leverage ratios state auto p c milbank farmers sa ohio sa national weighted average we use the statutory leverage ratio as there is no comparable gaap measure 
our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to state auto financial which in turn may be used by state auto financial to pay dividends to stockholders or to make principal and interest payments on debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay without prior approval 
under current law  at december   after adjustment for dividend payments made in the previous twelve month period  a total of million is available in for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to state auto financial  without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
in   and  state auto financial received million   and million in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries  respectively 
we are required to notify the insurance subsidiaries applicable state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary state commissioner of each insurance subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business 
the naic has developed risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc attempts to relate an individual insurance company s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations 
rbc requires the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
at december   the ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level of state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries ranged from to 

table of contents credit and financial strength ratings the following table summarizes our credit and insurance company financial strength ratings at december  am best moody s standard poor s stfc credit rating a baa bbb stfc pooled companies financial strength a a a sa national financial strength a n a a we are reviewed regularly by the independent rating agencies listed in the table above 
ratings provide a meaningful way for policyholders  agents  creditors and stockholders to compare us to our competitors 
the published credit ratings on state auto financial senior notes discussed above are opinions as to the ability of state auto financial to meet its ongoing obligations under the terms of the senior notes 
generally  credit ratings affect the cost  type and availability of debt financing 
higher rated securities receive more favorable pricing and terms relative to lower rated securities at the time of issue 
state auto financial s senior notes have been rated investment grade by each agency 
the published financial strength ratings on the insurance company subsidiaries of state auto financial are opinions as to the ability of those companies to meet their ongoing obligations to their policyholders 
the am best financial strength ratings influence our ability to write insurance business as agents and policyholders generally prefer higher rated companies 
lower rated companies may be required to compete for agents and policyholders by offering higher commissions or lower premiums and expanded coverage  or a combination thereof 
state auto mutual is one of only companies in the united states that have received am best s a or higher rating every year since the stfc pooled companies and the mutual pooled companies are collectively assigned a pool rating by am best while sa national is rated by a 
m 
best as a part of the total group 
our ratings are influenced by many factors including operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  financial leverage  exposure to catastrophe risks and operating leverage 
at december   our am best  moody s and standard poor s ratings were assigned stable outlooks 
other employee benefit plans the state auto group has a defined benefit pension plan and a postretirement health care plan covering substantially all employees collectively the benefit plans 
several factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we use a measurement date of september as currently permitted under sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas when determining our liabilities at december to calculate the state auto group s december  pension projected benefit obligation pbo we used a discount rate of based on an evaluation of the expected future benefit cash flows of our defined benefit pension plan used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate results in  all else equal  a higher present value of the benefit obligation 
we selected an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of by considering the mix of investments and stability of investment portfolio along with actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plan 
to calculate the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december   a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used 

table of contents the selected discount rate of increased points from the rate used in which had the effect of decreasing the pbo and related unrecognized net actuarial loss by approximately million 
cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately million  which are now being recognized on our balance sheet pursuant to sfas defined below  are being systematically recognized as an increase in net periodic cost over the average future service period of active participants 
unrecognized gains and losses arise from several factors including expected to actual demographic changes  assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets 
the accumulated benefit obligation abo of a defined benefit plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to the measurement date and based on current and past compensation levels  while the pbo is the abo plus a factor for future compensation levels 
at december   the abo and pbo were million and million  respectively 
at december  the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit pension plan was million  which resulted in an overfunding status within our balance sheet of million 
the state auto group has consistently targeted contributions to our defined benefit pension plan with the objective of maintaining a fully funded status on an abo basis 
historically our plan assets have exceeded our abo 
the abo  which considers current compensations level only  provides information about the obligation an employer would have if the plan were discontinued at the date of measurement date 
this funding objective has served our plan participants well knowing that we were fully funded on a current basis as well as the fact that we have not had to recognize in or anytime prior an additional minimum liability as would have been previously required under sfas key assumptions used in determining the amount of the benefit obligation and related periodic cost recognized for postretirement benefits other than pensions under sfas include the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate 
to calculate the state auto group s benefit obligation for our health care plan  we increased our selected discount rate by points to from the discount rate to match the anticipated stream of future benefit payments 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and cost containment initiatives 
for the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was for  trending down per year to thereafter 
the change in the discount rate and adjustment for the assumed health care cost trend rate had the effect of increasing the benefit obligation and related unrecognized net actuarial loss by approximately million 
the benefit obligation under our health care plan was million at december  which exceeded the fair value of plan assets of million  resulting in an underfunding status of million in our balance sheet 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas which requires employers with defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  such as health care  to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans on its balance sheet and measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end balance sheet date thereby eliminating the use of an earlier measurement date and to provide additional disclosures 
the new measurement date requirement is not effective until fiscal years ending after december  adopting sfas required us to recognize the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations on our balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adoption of sfas at december  had the impact of decreasing accumulated comprehensive income by million  net of tax  which was represented by the following for our pension plan net unrecognized actuarial losses of million million net of tax  unrecognized prior service costs of million million net of tax  unrecognized transition asset remaining from the initial adoption of sfas of million million net of tax  all of which were previously netted against the plan s funded status on our balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of sfas these amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of our net periodic cost benefit pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing and allocating such amounts

the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining benefit obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
loss and loss expense reserves our loss and loss expense reserves include the accumulation of unpaid individual case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims 
our loss and loss expense reserves are not discounted to present value 
losses and allocated loss expense reserves loss and alae reserve are management s best estimates mbe at a given point in time of what we expect to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
the process for calculating the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserve is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses and allocated loss expenses incurred  and then subtract all amounts already paid and held in case and formula reserves 

table of contents the ultimate determination of mbe integrates information and analysis provided by several disciplines within our company  including claims  actuarial and accounting 
this assessment requires considerable judgment in understanding how claims mature  which lines of business are the most volatile  and how trends change over time 
loss and alae reserves represent an estimate at a given point in time based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
although we consider many different sources of information  as well as a number of actuarial methodologies to estimate our loss and alae reserve  there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
our internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on many of the assumptions underlying each reserving methodology  such as claim frequency  claim severity and loss ratios 
nonetheless  changes  which are not contemplated  do occur over time  and those changes are incorporated in subsequent valuations of the loss reserves 
we use a number of different methodologies to estimate the ibnr component of the loss and alae reserves 
our reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail lines of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
the reserving methods and strengths and weaknesses of each are described below 
short tail business for short tailed contracts  the claims are typically settled within five years  and the most common actuarial estimates are based on techniques using link ratio projections of incurred losses  paid losses  claim counts and claim severities 
each of these methods is described below in detail 
separate projections are made for catastrophes that are in the very early stages of development based on specific information known through the reporting date 
incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is probably the most common actuarial method used in projecting indicated ibnr reserves 
this method uses paid loss experience as well as the outstanding estimates average and case reserves for claims that have been reported and are still open 
the underlying assumption of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy remains consistent over time 
this method s advantage is its responsiveness to changes in reported losses  which is particularly valuable in the less mature accident years 
the disadvantage of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy changes will distort the ibnr projections 
paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses calculations that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
the key difference is that the data used in paid methods excludes the case reserve estimates  so only paid losses are utilized 
with these methods  a payment pattern is estimated to project ultimate settlement values for each accident year  with the underlying assumption that claims are settled at a consistent rate over time 
neither case reserves nor the rate at which claims are reported except to the extent that the reporting pattern might influence the payment pattern is relevant to the results of this method 
this method s advantage is the estimates of ultimate loss are independent of case reserve adequacy and are unaffected by company changes in case reserving philosophy 
the disadvantages are that the paid method does not use all of the available information  and in some cases the liability payment patterns require the application of very large development factors to relatively small payments in the immature years 
claim counts and severities method the counts and severities method calculations are very similar to the other methods 
the incurred claim counts reported to date are projected to an ultimate value 
similarly  the incurred loss severities are projected to ultimate 
the ultimate incurred count is multiplied by the ultimate 
table of contents incurred severity  for each accident year  to arrive at the ultimate incurred loss 
finally  as with the other loss development methods  an estimate of the ibnr reserve is calculated by subtracting the reported losses from the estimated ultimate losses 
long tail business reserve estimates for long tailed contracts use the same methods listed above for short tailed lines  along with several other methods as determined by the actuary 
for example  premium based methods may be used in developing ultimate loss estimates  including the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson  and least squares techniques as described below 
we also use statistical models when the historical patterns can be reasonably approximated 
expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method generates indicated ibnr by multiplying an expected loss ratio by earned premium  then subtracting incurred to date losses 
for slower reporting lines of business  new products  or data that is very immature  the actual claim data is often too thin for traditional projections 
with this method the premiums are used as a measure of loss exposure  and the loss ratios can be derived from pricing expectations 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a weighted average of the expected loss ratio method and the incurred loss development method  using the percentage of losses reported as the weight 
this method is particularly useful where there is a low volume of data in the current accident period  or where the experience is volatile 
in general this method produces estimates that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
least square loss development method in the least squares loss development method the statistical technique of least squares regression is applied to a triangle of reported loss ratios to project the ultimate loss ratio in each accident year 
using historical loss ratios puts the data for each time period on a more consistent exposure basis  because premium levels generally correlate well with insured exposures 
a by product of the regression function is an estimate of credibility for each stage of development 
in cases where the regression parameters fall outside of a reasonable range  the projection defaults to the incurred loss method 
selection process in determining which reserving method to use for a particular line of business or accident year  diagnostic tests of loss ratios and severity trends are considered  as well as the historic case reserve adequacy and claim settlement rate 
in general the incurred loss development method is used if the projections are stable  the data is credible  historic case reserve adequacy is consistent  and the loss ratios and loss severities are reasonable 
other reserving methods are considered as well for particular lines of business or accident years  given supplementary information like open claim counts and prior period development 
for example  if more than one method provides a reasonable projection  the actuary may select an average of those methods 
there is considerable judgment applied in the analysis of the historical patterns and in applying business knowledge that reflects our underwriting and claims risk 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections 
the primary determinant in estimating the reserve range boundaries are the variances measured within the historical reserving data for the various lines of business 
property lines typically have smaller variances  while liability lines can experience significant variability 
mbe of loss reserves considers the expected variation to establish an appropriate position within a range 
mbe for sa national and the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies loss and alae reserves at december  was million  within a projected range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore  these values cannot be compared to many of the other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 
the potential impact of the reserve variability on net income is quantifiable using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach the high point of million  the 
table of contents reserve increase of million is an after tax decrease of million on net income 
likewise  should losses decline to the low end of million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other liability loss and alae reserve to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary jump could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million after tax reduction assuming a tax rate of to net income 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 
in addition to establishing loss and alae reserves  as described above  we establish reserves for loss adjustment expenses contemplating functions and costs that are not attributable to a specific claim  which is called unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae 
based on historical patterns  selected ratios of paid ulae to paid losses are imposed on the current outstanding reserves 
consequently  this component of the loss expense reserve has a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held reserves by accident year  as they move up or down in sync with carried reserves 
the method uses a traditional assumption that of the expenses are incurred when the claim is open  and the other are incurred when the claim is closed  and also assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change drastically over time

the property and casualty industry has had significant loss experience from claims related to asbestos  environmental remediation  product liability  mold and other mass torts 
asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net losses and loss expenses payable 
our environmental reserves increased approximately million from primarily from the state of indiana where there was an adverse court ruling several years ago 
because we have insured primarily product retailers and distributors  we do not expect to incur the same level of liability as companies that have insured manufacturing risks 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded

table of contents new accounting standards adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas that requires employers with defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions collectively benefit plans to recognize the funded status of their benefit plans in their balance sheet  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end balance sheet date thereby eliminating the use of an earlier measurement date and provide additional disclosures 
the new measurement date requirement is not effective until fiscal years ending after december  on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas  which had no effect on the company s consolidated statement of income for year ended december   or for any prior period presented in the form k  and it will not affect the company s operating results in future periods 
adopting sfas required the company to recognize the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations of its benefit plans in the december  balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive loss  net of tax of million 
the adoption did not have an impact on the company s debt covenants

in september  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sop provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs associated with modifications to or the internal replacement of insurance contracts 
sop focuses on modifications to contracts with integrated product features and internal replacement of contracts in which the new contract offers product features not included in the old contract when both were priced together 
the company s insurance contracts include only nonintegrated contract features as defined in sop  which are contract features that provide coverage that is underwritten and priced only for that incremental insurance coverage and that do not result in re underwriting or re pricing of other components of the contract 
nonintegrated contract features do not

this will be effective for tax benefits of dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this guidance effective january  and it had no material impact on the company s financial statements 
impact of significant external factors inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
general inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has been relatively modest over the last several years 
however  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims has been steadily increasing 
in particular  repair costs for homes  autos  commercial buildings  and medical care costs  have risen disproportionately over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following substantial natural catastrophes such as the industry experienced in florida and adjacent states in and in mississippi and alabama in we continue to adjust our pricing projections as loss cost trends change in order to ensure premiums keep pace with inflation in all lines of business 
we consider inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 
in loss and loss expenses reserves  we include a discussion of certain factors management considers in estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses 
with respect to the auto line of business  which represents approximately of our total reserves  perhaps the most significant external variable is legal developments 
court decisions  as discussed below  have had significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry 
some of these decisions have a more prospective effect  for example  when contract 
table of contents provisions relating to third party coverages are construed in ways not anticipated by us 
other court decisions may have more of a retroactive effect which may be seen more clearly in the auto insurance line 
auto insurance tends to be a line of business more regulated by statutes  consequently  the courts tend to have more of an opportunity to construe and apply those statutes to existing contracts 
uninsured motorists and underinsured motorists collectively um are statutory coverages in almost every state where we do business 
if a court construes a um statute adversely to us and the industry  the decision typically has a retroactive effect with the court s interpretation being applied as if the um statute has always been interpreted that way 
this retroactive application is exacerbated in um cases and other first party coverage cases because the statute of limitations applicable to um claims and other first party coverages can be as long as years 
claims that had been closed or not even presented  going back as long as fifteen years  can be restored by an adverse court decision 
we consider the impact of adverse court decisions of which we have become aware when we set ultimate loss and loss expense reserves for auto insurance as well as other lines to the extent those lines may be retroactively affected by such matters 
the effect of court decisions is also apparent in the commercial lines of coverages such as commercial multi peril and other liability and products liability 
courts can expand coverage or void exclusions which can increase our exposure to claims 
some of these third party claims may still be brought within the statute of limitations applicable to such third party claims and expose us to some retroactive liabilities 
these liabilities are sought to be addressed by the ultimate loss and loss expense reserve that is our estimate of loss and loss expenses payable 
it is not feasible to quantify the impact of judicial decisions that may have retroactive effect because we cannot foresee  among the range of issues that are litigated every day in courts in each state in which we do business  which cases will be decided adversely and how such decisions will actually apply to us 
the reserve estimates do not contemplate substantial loss from any mass torts  including those already listed above  or others not known at this time 
in addition  there is no provision in the reserves for a major retroactive expansion of coverage through judicial interpretation 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  ultimate liabilities could increase substantially 
our claims  underwriting and actuarial staff track separately all claims within the family of mass torts  and respond accordingly as information becomes known 
premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume including eliminating exclusions  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected  and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can adversely affect an insurer 
we may also be adversely affected by regulatory actions on matters within the jurisdiction of the various insurance departments where we do business or have entities domiciled
