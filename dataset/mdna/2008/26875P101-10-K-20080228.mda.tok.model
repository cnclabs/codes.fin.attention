risk factors our business and operations are subject to many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face  as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently believe are immaterial 
if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely 
since we are primarily a natural gas company  we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil  condensate or natural gas liquids 
among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are the level of consumer demand  weather conditions  domestic drilling activity  the price and availability of alternative fuels  including liquefied natural gas  the proximity to  and capacity of  transportation facilities  worldwide economic and political conditions  the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures  and the natural and extent of governmental regulation and taxation  including environmental regulations 
our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil 
prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity  the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures  our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 
our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially affected if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 
the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
moreover  we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own  and these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons  or may not be available to us in the future 
any significant change in market factors affecting these facilities  the availability of these facilities or our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity 
demand for natural gas and crude oil is  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  and sea level changes associated with climate change  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment 
extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations  including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations  maintenance and repairs and the installation of new facilities 
such extreme weather conditions and changes associated with climate change could materially and adversely affect our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be misstated 
estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes in conditions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated 
to prepare estimates of economically recoverable natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves  we analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs 
our actual proved reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves  which could  in turn  materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 
if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves  our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 
the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
our future natural gas and crude oil production  specifically maintaining our production at  or increasing our production from  current levels  is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves 
drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a high risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control 
drilling natural gas and crude oil wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs 
as a result  we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 
the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents  among other factors  may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a partial or total loss of our investment 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and operating wells  as our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled  and the cost of such operations may increase  as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  which may increase our costs or restrict our activities  costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  tubular materials and equipment  lack of infrastructure  and lack of trained drilling personnel 
we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations  especially regulations relating to environmental protection  and could incur even greater costs in the future 
our exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels  as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in foreign countries in which we do business 
we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations 
further  the regulatory environment in the natural gas and crude oil industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance 
as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
these regulations may  among other things  impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations  subject us to liability for pollution damages  and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
changes in  or additions to  regulations regarding the protection of the environment could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
eog is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues 
we are also aware of legislation  recently proposed by the canadian legislature  to reduce ghg emissions 
additionally  proposed united states policy  legislation or regulatory actions may also address ghg emissions 
eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies  legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities 
the exploration for  and production of  natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous  involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  cratering  fires and loss of well control  which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities  injure or kill people  and damage property and the environment 
moreover  our offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils  including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable 
the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the fund s available to us for exploration  drilling and production and could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
from time to time  we use derivative instruments primarily collars and price swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude oil prices on our net income and cash flow 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
in addition  we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations  particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver natural gas and crude oil volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed 
if we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties  our failure to fully identify potential problems  to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs  or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties 
although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired that we believe are consistent with industry practices  reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
even when problems with a property are identified  we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 
moreover  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves  actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties 
actual reserves  production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
in addition  acquisitions may have material and adverse effects on our business and results of operations  particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations 
terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks  whether domestic or foreign  as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts  could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets 
the united states government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways  including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets  increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices  or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of natural gas and crude oil leases  properties and reserves  equipment and labor required to explore  develop and operate those properties and the marketing of natural gas and crude oil production 
higher recent natural gas and crude oil prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition  and there are several companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 
in addition  many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil  such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production  the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 
we also compete with our competitors in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other specialists 
we have substantial capital requirements  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  production  exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations and commercial paper borrowings and  to a lesser extent and if and as necessary  bank borrowings and public and private equity and debt offerings 
lower natural gas and crude oil prices  however  would reduce our cash flow 
further  if the condition of the capital markets materially declines  we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable 
the recent credit crisis triggered by the subprime mortgage markets and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk  generally  may increase the interest rates that the lenders require us to pay 
in addition  a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment 
any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 
the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
however  certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the united states and have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses into us dollars at then applicable exchange rates 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if the value has not changed in the original currency 
these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiarie s whose functional currency is not the us dollar

item properties oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves reserve information 
for estimates of eog s net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids  including crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids  see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers normally vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
for related discussion  see item a 
risk factors 
in general  production from eog s natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced 
volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing 
eog s estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return  drilling internally generated prospects  delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available to common stockholders for of  million was down compared to net income available to common stockholders of  million 
at december   eog s total reserves were trillion cubic feet equivalent  an increase of billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december  operations several important developments have occurred since january  united states and canada 
eog s effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada 
eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays  which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eog s natural gas and crude oil production 
production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately of total company production in as compared to in based on current trends  eog expects its production profile to be similar 
eog s major producing areas are in louisiana  new mexico  texas  utah  wyoming and western canada 
in december  eog entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the appalachian basin to a subsidiary of exco resources  inc  an independent oil and gas company  for approximately million  subject to customary adjustments under the agreement 
the appalachian area being divested includes approximately  operated wells that accounted for approximately of eog s total production and approximately of its total year end proved reserves 
the transaction closed on february  eog retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area  including rights in the marcellus shale  and will continue its shale exploration program 
on december   the book value of the assets and liabilities included in the sale were million and million  respectively 
international 
although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas  eog continues to see linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidad natural gas supply 
in trinidad  eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts 
under the atlantic lng train alng contract  eog delivered gas at the contractual rate of million cubic feet per day mmcfd  gross mmcfd  net beginning in may when the alng plant reached commercial status 
in march  eog acquired the remaining working interest from primera block a limited  a trinidadian company  and now holds a working interest in block a 
in july  eog executed a year natural gas contract with the national gas company of trinidad and tobago ngc for the sale of approximately mmcfd  gross mmcfd  net to eog  based on current pricing and operating assumptions 
eog expects to begin initial delivery under this contract in early from its first discovery on block a  subject to the completion of a pipeline by ngc 
in may  eog acquired the remainder of the interest in the modified u b block from primera oil gas ltd  a trinidadian company  and now holds a working interest in the modified u b block 
in august  eog drilled the u b exploratory well on the modified u b block  and the well was determined to be non commercial 
in  eog agreed to purchase an interest in the pelican field facilities from the subsidiaries of the other participants in the south east coast consortium block 
the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of during  eog executed a one year term sheet  effective july   with the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago that sets forth the pricing for the sales of crude oil and condensate produced in trinidad 
the pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin 
this term sheet replaces the pricing provisions of a previous crude oil and condensate sales contract that expired on june  and will be incorporated into a new crude oil and condensate sales contract which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of in addition to eog s ongoing production from the valkyrie and arthur fields in the united kingdom north sea  eog participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block f  at the end of in  a successful appraisal well was drilled on this prospect 
the future development of this prospect is currently being evaluated 
eog also participated in the drilling of an unsuccessful exploratory well in august on the eos prospect located in the southern north sea block c 
eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified 
capital structure one of management s key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog s peer group 
at december   eog s debt to total capitalization ratio was  up from at year end by primarily utilizing cash on hand  cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from long term debt borrowings  eog funded billion in exploration and development and other property  plant and equipment expenditures  paid down million of debt  paid dividends to common and preferred stockholders of million and paid million for the redemption of preferred stock 
as management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for  eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations 
for  eog s budget for exploration and development and other property  plant and equipment expenditures is approximately billion  excluding acquisitions 
united states and canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures 
when it fits eog s strategy  eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and or production opportunities 
management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog s history 
on september   eog completed its public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on march and september of each year  beginning march  net proceeds from the offering were approximately million and were used for general corporate purposes  including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities 
on september   eog filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s new registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of up to  of eog s debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock 
the new registration statement was filed to replace eog s then existing shelf registration statement which had been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec in october and under which eog had sold no securities 
as of december   and as a result of the issuance of the notes  eog may offer and sell up to  of debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock under the new registration statement 
in  eog repurchased a total of  shares of its outstanding fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock  series b  with a  liquidation preference per share series b  for an aggregate purchase price  including premium and fees  of million  plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase 
eog has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases 
at december    shares of the series b with a book value of million remained outstanding 
such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in january see note to consolidated financial statements

the composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to per mcf for from per mcf in natural gas deliveries increased mmcfd  or  to  mmcfd for from  mmcfd in the increase was due to higher production of mmcfd in the united states  partially offset by lower production of mmcfd in trinidad  mmcfd in the united kingdom and mmcfd in canada 
the increase in the united states was primarily attributable to increased production from texas mmcfd  the rocky mountain area mmcfd  kansas mmcfd and mississippi mmcfd 
the decline in trinidad was due to reduced deliveries to alng mmcfd and a decrease in contractual demand mmcfd 
during  eog supplied gas for use in alng s start up phase

the primary factors impacting per unit rates of lease and well  transportation costs  dd a  g a and net interest expense for as compared to are set forth below 
lease and well expenses include expenses for eog operated properties  as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property 
lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eog s oil and natural gas wells  the cost of workovers  and lease and well administrative expenses 
operating and maintenance expenses include  among other things  pumping services  salt water disposal  equipment repair and maintenance  compression expense  lease upkeep  and fuel and power 
workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient  safe and environmentally responsible operations 
eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas 
operating costs within these existing and new areas  as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors  fluctuate over time 
lease and well expenses of million in were million higher than due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states million and canada million  higher lease and well administrative expenses million  higher workover expenditures in the united states million and changes in the canadian exchange rate million 
transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a down stream point of sale 
transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements  dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements  gathering fees  fuel costs and transportation fees 
transportation costs of million in were million higher than due primarily to increased production in the fort worth basin barnett shale play and related costs associated with new marketing arrangements to transport the increased production to new downstream markets 
dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
eog s dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact eog s composite dd a rate and expense  such as field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance  and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause eog s composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year

the estimated fair value of eog s debt at december  and was  million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and  where such prices were not available  upon interest rates available to eog at year end 
eog s debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
at december   a decline in interest rates would result in an million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
during and  eog utilized cash provided by operating activities  net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facility borrowings to fund its capital programs 
while eog maintains a billion commercial paper program  the maximum outstanding at any time during was million  and the amount outstanding at year end was zero 
the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during was million with no amounts outstanding at year end 
eog considers this excess availability  which is backed by the billion revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note to consolidated financial statements  combined with approximately million of availability under its shelf registration described below  to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 
during september  eog issued million aggregate principal amount of its notes 
net proceeds of approximately million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities

in addition  this table does not include eog s pension or postretirement benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december  management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 
amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services 
off balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities or partnerships  often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other off balance sheet arrangement as defined in item a of regulation s k during any of the periods in this report  and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries  including canada  trinidad and the united kingdom 
the foreign currency most significant to eog s operations during was the canadian dollar 
the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in impacted both the revenues and expenses of eog s canadian subsidiaries 
however  since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices  the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses 
eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
effective march   eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note to consolidated financial statements 
eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
 and under those provisions  as of december   eog recorded the fair value of the swap of million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of million for the year ended december  the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
outlook pricing 
natural gas prices historically have been volatile  and this volatility is expected to continue 
uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends  and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry 
being primarily a natural gas producer  eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices 
longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels  such as oil and coal 
the market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate in will impact the level of eog s total capital expenditures as well as its production 
including the impact of eog s natural gas and crude oil hedges  based on eog s tax position and the portion of eog s anticipated natural gas volumes for for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts  eog s price sensitivity for each per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
eog s price sensitivity in for each per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price  combined with the related change in natural gas liquids prices  is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
for information regarding eog s natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of december   see note to consolidated financial statements 
capital 
eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada 
in  eog expects to allocate an increased amount of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the fort worth basin barnett shale and the rocky mountain operating area which includes the uinta basin and the north dakota bakken 
in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio  eog anticipates continuing to expend a portion of its available funds in the further development of trinidad and the united kingdom north sea 
in addition  eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities 
budgeted exploration and development expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are approximately billion 
in addition  budgeted expenditures for na tural gas gathering and processing and other assets are approximately million 
the total capital expenditures budget of billion  excluding acquisitions  is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eog s strategy of funding its exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow 
the level of total capital expenditures may vary in and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  eog believes net operating cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and available financing alternatives in will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year 
however  eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states  canada  trinidad and the united kingdom  such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 
operations 
based on average north american natural gas prices of per mcf at henry hub and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of billion  excluding acquisitions  eog expects to increase overall production in by over levels 
united states production is expected to increase by  with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of and  respectively 
environmental regulations various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect eog s operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration  development and production operations  and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment 
in addition  eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eog s control 
under environmental laws and regulations  eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators 
in addition  eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases eog s overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on eog s operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations  but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
eog is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues 
we are also aware of legislation  recently proposed by the canadian legislature  to reduce ghg emissions 
additionally  proposed united states policy  legislation or regulatory actions may also address ghg emissions 
eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies  legislation or regulations in the areas where we are operating to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of eog s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their deployment 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of eog s most critical accounting policies proved oil and gas reserves eog s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic cond itions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
oil and gas exploration costs eog accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient t o justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
as of december  and  eog had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note to consolidated financial statements 
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive  based on historical experience  is amortized over the average holding period 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
when circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on eog s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments 
stock based compensation effective january   eog accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
in applying the provisions of sfas r  judgments and estimates are made regarding  among other things  the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies 
assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog s common stock  the level of risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields on eog s stock  the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change 
any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
information regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts  including  among others  statements regarding eog s future financial position  business strategy  budgets  reserve information  projected levels of production  projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations  are forward looking statements 
eog typically uses words such as expect  anticipate  estimate  strategy  intend  plan  target and believe or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward looking statements 
in particular  statements  express or implied  concerning future operating results  the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production  or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forwar d looking statements
