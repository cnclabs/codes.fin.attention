item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report includes forward looking statements 
generally  the words believes  anticipates  may  will  should  expect  intend  estimate  continue  and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including the matters set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with the securities and exchange commission from time to time  which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected 
undue reliance should not be placed on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we discuss our results in terms of financial measures that may be deemed to be non gaap financial measures under the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
our management believes that these measures provide meaningful information regarding the company s performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of its core operating results and facilitate comparisons to its historical operations and competitors operating results 
to the extent such measures are not readily reconcilable to the comparable gaap financial measures contained in its consolidated financial statements  we provide detailed reconciliations that permit investors to determine how such non gaap financial measures have been derived 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview headquartered in shandong province  prc  new dragon asia corp 
is engaged in the milling  sale and distribution of flour and related products  including instant noodles and soybean derived products  to retail and wholesale customers throughout china 
with a well known brand name called long feng  we market our well established product line through a countrywide network of more than key distributors and regional offices in chinese provinces 
we have eight manufacturing plants in the prc with an aggregate production capacity of approximately  tons of flour and approximately billion packets of instant noodles and  tons of soybean powder 
operation plan our current strategies are to acquire additional plants to enlarge our capacity  and to build strategic alliances with multinational food groups to enhance product range and capitalize on our china distribution network 
plans for expansion of the existing plants are expected to be funded through current working capital from ongoing sales 
a significant acquisition will require additional funds in the form of debt or equity  or a combination of both 
however  there can be no assurance these funds will be available 
establishment and acquisitions longyuan packaging plant on january   the company established new dragon asia long kou packing materials company limited  a wholly owned subsidiary in longkou  shandong province 
ndapm is principally engaged in the manufacturing and sale of packing materials  with a registered capital of  during the year ended december   the company has spent approximately million on the construction at the new plant and has committed further capital expenditure of million for the completion of the plant  which is scheduled to complete in year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected information from the consolidated statements of operations in thousands for the years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold selling and distribution expenses general and administrative expenses including stock based compensation of  for gain loss on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives vat refund net income loss ebitda ebitda margin on revenue the company uses ebitda as an operating performance measure 
ebitda is defined as net earnings loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense and in our case loss gain on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives 
ebitda is not a measure of operating performance under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap profitability measures such as operating earnings loss and net earnings loss 
ebitda as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes  among other things  the statement of operations impact of depreciation and amortization expense  interest expense  the provision benefit for income taxes and loss gain on fair value adjustments to embedded derivatives and therefore does not necessarily represent an accurate measure of profitability  particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure 
the company uses a significant amount of capital assets and depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of the company s costs and ability to generate revenue and therefore its exclusion from ebitda is a material limitation 
the company generally incurs significant income taxes each year and the provision benefit for income taxes is a necessary element of the company s costs and therefore its exclusion from ebitda is a material limitation 
as a result  ebitda should be evaluated in conjunction with net earnings loss for a more complete analysis of the company s profitability  as net earnings loss includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure to ebitda 
as ebitda is not defined by gaap  the company s definition of ebitda may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of the limitations that ebitda has as an analytical tool  investors should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of the company s operating results as reported under gaap 
net revenue net revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was due to the growth in market demand principally for soybean products  which increased from million in to million in the selling prices for all our products remained stable 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the increase was primarily due to the growth of our soybean products business and the slight increase of raw material cost

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses decreased million to million from million of the decrease was primarily due to the fact that stock based compensation expense of million in was zero in our general and administrative expenses expense returned to normal level without the stock compensation expense

for the year ended december   the gain in this regard was million 
for the corresponding period of  the loss in this regard was million 
the determination of the change in the value of the derivatives requires the use of a complex valuation model and can fluctuate significantly between periods based on changes in the price of our shares and the time remaining in the life of the underlying financial instruments 
increase in our stock s market value increases the value of the derivative creating losses in our income statements and decrease in the stock s market value reduces the value of the derivatives creating gains in our income statements 
vat refund vat refund decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this primarily represents less tax refund from the municipal government during the current year

the adjustments of approximately resulted in decrease to pretax income and related principally to revenue recognition errors and the correction of amortization of land use rights 
the full amount of this charge to income was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  rather than charging the prior quarters in the fiscal year 
management evaluated the quantitative and qualitative impact of these interim period errors and concluded that the effect was not material 
as a result  previously issued quarterly financial information has not been restated

historically  the company has financed its working capital requirements through a combination of internally generated cash and advances from related companies 
the company s working capital increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to i the increased inventory and ii the change in the fair value of derivative instruments 
cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   a decrease of million as compared to the balance at december  of million 
net cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million net cash provided for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to i additional deposits and prepayments of  paid to suppliers for wheat and soybean in order to secure additional supplies and ii increase in inventories of  in anticipation of price increases 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the fact that no new business establishment and acquisition was incurred in net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  was primarily the net balance due to the parent company

off balance sheet arrangements we have never entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not formed any special purpose entities

inflation and changing prices the company does not foresee any adverse effects on its earnings as a result of inflation or changing prices 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated from sales of flour and instant noodle 
all of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
we determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions after considering whether a contract exists  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the contract have been fulfilled and delivered 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
accounting for derivative instruments statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires all derivatives to be recorded on the company s balance sheet at fair value 
these derivatives  including embedded derivatives in the company s series a and b redeemable convertible preferred stock are separately valued and accounted for on the company s balance sheet 
the pricing models the company uses for determining fair values of its derivatives are a combination of the black scholes and binomial pricing models 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates and option volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income loss 
the company has obtained a valuation report from a valuation firm to support its estimates 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  eitf which requires freestanding contracts that are settled in a company s own stock  including common stock warrants  to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or a liability 
under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value on a company s balance sheet  with any changes in fair value recorded in the company s results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no fair value adjustments are required 
the company has determined that the conversion features of its redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock are derivatives that the company is required to account for as if they were free standing instruments under gaap 
the company has also determined that it is required to designate these derivatives as liabilities in its financial statements 
as a result  the company reports the value of these embedded derivatives as current liabilities on its balance sheet and reports changes in the value of these derivatives as non operating gains or losses on its statement of operations 
the value of the derivatives is required to be recalculated and resulting non operating gains or losses reflected in the statement of operations and resulting adjustments to the associated liability amounts reflected on the balance sheet on a quarterly basis  and is based on the market value of the company s common stock 
due to the nature of the required calculations and the large number of shares of the company s common stock involved in such calculations  changes in the company s common stock price may result in significant changes in the value of the derivatives and resulting gains and losses on the company s statement of operations 
the consolidated financial statements also reflect additional non operating gains and losses related to the classification of and accounting for the conversion features of the series a and b preferred stock and associated warrants  the amortization associated with the discount recorded with respect to the series a and b preferred stock as a preferred stock dividend  and the conversion features associated with the preferred stock issued by the company and associated warrants 
stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r for the fiscal year beginning on december   and recorded the compensation expense for all unvested stock options 
contractual joint ventures a contractual joint venture is an entity established between the company and another joint venture partner  with the rights and obligations of each party governed by a contract 
currently  the company has established three contractual joint ventures with three chinese partners in china  with percentage of ownership ranging from to 
pursuant to each chinese joint venture agreement  each chinese joint venture partner is entitled to receive a pre determined annual fee and is not responsible for any profit or loss  regardless of the ownership in the contractual joint venture 
in view of such contracted profit sharing arrangement  the three contractual joint ventures are regarded as owned by the company 
hence  the company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the contractual joint ventures 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb may delay a portion of this standard 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired 
sfas no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent 
sfas no 
r and sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements  if any  upon adoption of sfas no 
r or sfas no 
we are aware that our accounting for minority interest will change and we are considering those effects now but believe we will only be a reclassification of minority interest from mezzanine equity to our stockholder s equity section in the balance sheet  in any case we do not believe the implementation of sfas will be material to our financial position 
sfas r will significantly affect the accounting for future business combinations and we will determine the accounting as new combinations are determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our series a and b preferred stock creates a fluctuation risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on the price and volatility of our common stock and the time to expiration of the derivatives related to the conversion features and the warrants 
the determination of the change in the value of the derivatives requires the use of a complex valuation model and can fluctuate significantly between periods based on changes in the price of our shares and the time remaining in the life of the underlying financial instruments 
increase in our stock s market price increases the value of the derivative creating losses in our income statements and decreases in the stock s market price reduce the value of the derivatives creating gains in our income statements 
unless our share price significantly rises  the fair value of the derivatives will continue to reduce as shares of our preferred stock are converted 
the current derivatives outstanding related to the preferred shares and expire by the end of currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk the majority of our operations are conducted in the prc except for some minor export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in chinese renminbi 
hence  the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rate is considered minimal to our business operations 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of renminbi into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of renminbi  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that renminbi will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of the our net assets and income derived from its operations in the prc 
interest rate risk the company does not have significant interest rate risk  as our debt obligations are primarily short term in nature  with fixed interest rates 
our embedded derivatives liabilities are revalued each accounting period and their fair value can be affected by interest rate fluctuations based on changes in the risk free interest rate generally the interest rate on intermediate term obligations of the united states government 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk as most of our customers are long term customers with outstanding payment records 
our receivables are regularly monitored by our credit manager
