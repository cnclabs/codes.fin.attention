this report  including the information incorporated by reference  contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the use of any of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our possible or assumed future results  successful integration of cj  flight volume and collection rates for cbs operations  size  structure and growth of our air medical services and products markets  continuation and or renewal of hbs contracts  acquisition of new and profitable products division contracts  and other matters 
the actual results that we achieve may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors section of this report  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other sections of this report  as well as in our quarterly reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based services cbs provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in hospital based services hbs provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists primarily of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbs division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbs operations than hbs operations because almost all of cbs revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to approximately of hbs revenue 
by contrast  of our costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended december   are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbs operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for same base transports for cbs operations were approximately  in compared to  in the decrease in same base transports has been partially attributed to shifting of transports to newly opened bases in adjacent locations 

table of contents reimbursement per transport 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient and are subject to collection risk on services provided to insured and uninsured patients 
medicare and medicaid also receive contractual discounts from our standard charges for flight services 
flight revenue is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
net reimbursement per transport for cbs operations is primarily a function of price  payer mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
in addition  the collection rate is impacted by changes in the cost of healthcare and health insurance  as the cost of healthcare increases  health insurance coverage provided by employers may be reduced or eliminated entirely  resulting in an increase in the uninsured population 
the average gross charge per transport increased in the year ended december   compared to  contributing to an increase of in net reimbursement per transport in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care as a percentage of related gross billings for cbs operations are as follows for years ended december  gross billings provision for contractual discounts provision for uncompensated care the increase in the total percentage of uncollectible accounts is primarily attributable to price increases 
although price increases generally increase the net reimbursement per transport from insurance payers  the amount per transport collectible from private patient payers and medicare and medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases 
therefore  depending upon overall payer mix  price increases will usually result in an increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts 
although we have not yet experienced significant increased limitations in the amount reimbursed by insurance companies  continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport to amounts less than our standard rates 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbs and hbs operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers oem s tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
five models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
since january   we have taken delivery of new aircraft and have the option to purchase additional aircraft through the end of we plan to replace discontinued models and other older aircraft with the new aircraft expected to be delivered under these options  as well as to provide capacity for base expansion 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense for cbs and hbs operations increased from to  while total flight volume for cbs and hbs operations increased over the same period 
during the year ended december   we incurred costs on fewer significant maintenance events related to older models of aircraft than during maintenance cost per hour on newer aircraft has remained relatively constant on an annual basis 
maintenance cost per hour on older models of aircraft  however  may vary more widely on a quarterly basis depending on component overhaul and replacement and aircraft refurbishment cycles 

table of contents aircraft availability 
the recent high rate of growth in the air medical transportation and other helicopter services industries has generated strong demand for new models of helicopters 
quality used aircraft are also in short supply worldwide 
we have endeavored to mitigate the shortage of suitable aircraft primarily through long term arrangements with a single aircraft manufacturer which provides us options to purchase up to ten aircraft each year for the next several years 
we also have a purchase commitment with another manufacturer for fifteen aircraft  with deliveries scheduled to begin in late or  as well as options for an additional fifteen aircraft in future years 
competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
deploying multiple aircraft in a market also serves as a barrier to entry for lower cost providers 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
in september  our pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit  and we signed a collective bargaining agreement cba on march  the agreement is effective january   through april  other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future

cbs net flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons net revenue of  from cj s cbs operations from the acquisition date through december  increase of in average gross charge per transport for the year ended december   compared to net reimbursement per transport increased approximately over the same period 
incremental net revenue of  generated from the addition of new cbs bases during either or  and  pursuant to a contract to support fema in disaster recovery efforts 
during the third quarter of  we mobilized thirteen aircraft to respond to the threat posed by hurricane dean in texas 
closure of one base during the fourth quarter of  the conversion of another base to hbs operations during the first quarter of  and the expiration in june of our contract with the state of mississippi to provide air medical transportation services in gulfport  mississippi  resulting in a decrease in net revenue of approximately decrease of approximately in same base transports in compared to the decrease in same base transports has been partially attributed to shifting of transports to newly opened bases in adjacent locations 

table of contents hbs net flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons net revenue of  from cj s hbs operations from the acquisition date through december  incremental net revenue of  generated from the addition of four new contracts  the expansion of three contracts  and the conversion of one cbs location to hbs operations during either or cessation of service under three contracts and the conversion of two contracts to cbs operations during either or  resulting in a decrease in net revenue of approximately  annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index or spare parts prices from aircraft manufacturers and the renewal of contracts at higher rates 
flight volume for all contracts excluding cj and other new contracts  contract expansions  and the discontinued contracts discussed above remained relatively unchanged 
flight center costs consisting primarily of pilot  mechanic  and medical staff salaries and benefits increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to changes by business segment were as follows cbs flight center costs increased  or  to  for the following reasons flight center costs of approximately  related to cj s cbs operations from the acquisition date through december  increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities to staff new base locations and contracts described above 
decrease of  due to the closure of base locations described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
hbs flight center costs increased  or  to  primarily due to the following flight center costs of approximately  related to cj s hbs operations from the acquisition date through december  increase of approximately  for the addition of personnel to staff new base locations described above 
decrease of approximately  due to the base closures described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following aircraft operating expenses of  related to cj s operations from the acquisition date through december  decrease of in the cost of aircraft maintenance  excluding the effect of cj aircraft and other new aircraft added to the fleet during the year 
annual price increases in the cost of spare parts and overhauls were offset in part by our ability to use exchange components rather than new parts in certain instances and by increased life cycle intervals approved on certain life limited components 
since the first quarter of  we have placed new helicopters into service and eliminated seventeen aircraft which were older models 
maintenance cost per hour on newer aircraft tend to remain relatively constant on an annual basis 
maintenance cost per hour on older models of aircraft  however  may vary more widely on a quarterly basis depending on component overhaul and replacement and aircraft refurbishment cycles 
during we incurred costs on fewer significant maintenance events related to older models of aircraft than during changes in flight volume for bases open longer than one year for both cbs and hbs as described above 
increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
total fuel costs were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  decrease in hull insurance rates effective july and 
table of contents aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  expense for cj aircraft under operating leases totaled approximately  from the acquisition date through december  incremental rental expense incurred in for other leased aircraft added to our fleet during either or totaled  the increase for new aircraft was offset in part by selling two aircraft and refinancing thirteen at lower lease rates or through debt financing 
medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  in  we completed production of mev litter systems and seven modular medical interior kits for commercial customers 
as of december   two design contracts with the us army and contracts for ten hh l units  fifty mev units  and three commercial medical interiors were in process 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  multi mission interiors  modular medical interiors  other aerospace and medical transport products in  we completed production of mev litter systems and eleven modular  medical interior kits for commercial customers 
we also continued work on eleven hh l units 
in the fourth quarter  we began production of additional mev units 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  multi mission interiors  modular medical interiors  other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products increased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year  due in part to the change in sales volume 
the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in  reflecting increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our aircraft interior systems and the change in product mix 
margins earned on multi mission interiors are generally higher than margins earned on medical interiors for commercial customers 
in addition  aircraft interiors completed for commercial customers during included some new types of aircraft in which we had not previously installed our modular interior  leading to higher engineering and documentation costs and lower profit margins 
in order to meet schedule requirements for both the external contracts described above and the significant number of aircraft interiors manufactured and installed in our own fleet during  the products division relied more heavily on outside contractors to supplement in house labor than was necessary in the prior year 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december  depreciation on assets acquired in the cj transaction totaled approximately  from the acquisition date through december  the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of placing three aircraft totaling  into service and the purchase of new rotable equipment and aircraft interiors 
general and administrative g a expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the cj acquisition and increases in compensation for merit pay raises 
g a expenses include executive management  accounting and finance  billing and collections  information services  human resources  aviation management  pilot training  dispatch and communications  and cbs program administration 
we increased staffing for g a departments over in the fourth quarter to manage the expanded operations with the acquisition of cj  and increased staffing in our information services department over the course of the year to support scheduled systems upgrades 
because of the additional program administration required for cbs operations  growth in cbs operations will generally necessitate more g a support than growth in hbs operations 
in addition  g a expenses for the year ended december   included stock compensation expense of  related to the grant of stock options  compared to  of stock compensation expense in the year ended december  g a expenses were of revenue in compared to of revenue in 
table of contents interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  primarily as a result of regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and decreased borrowings against our line of credit

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of  as of december   compared to  as of december  the change in working capital position is primarily attributable to an increase of  in net trade receivables consistent with the acquisition of cj  increased net revenue for the cbs and hbs divisions  and increased net reimbursement for cbs operations 
in addition  at december   we had a receivable for refundable income taxes of  primarily as a result of the prepayment of federal income taxes 
offsetting these increases in working capital was an increase the current installments of long term debt due to balloon payments scheduled for and the refinancing of our term loan which resulted in increased annual principal amortization

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements residual value guarantees we have entered into various aircraft operating leases under which we provide residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  of this amount   relates to aircraft operating leases which were assumed in the cj acquisition 
no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and our actual and expected loss experience 
aircraft purchase commitments in july  we entered into a commitment agreement to purchase fifteen bell helicopters for approximately million  beginning in  with a minimum of three deliveries per year 
the purchase price increases per year until delivery 
the agreement provides for special incentives  including a trade in option for up to fifteen bell helicopters  with minimum guaranteed trade in values 
due to delays in the manufacturer s processes  delivery of the first bell helicopter is currently expected in late  with the remaining units to be delivered over approximately the following two and a half years 
during and  we entered into additional purchase commitments for various models of bell and eurocopter helicopters 
as of december   commitments for aircraft for approximately million are still open 
deliveries under these commitments are expected from through we also have options to enter into additional purchase commitments for future years dependent upon our aircraft requirements 
prior to our acquisition date  cj had entered into two commitments to purchase eurocopter aircraft 
as of december   commitments for seventeen aircraft for approximately million are still open  and deliveries are expected from through we intend to use the new aircraft for base expansion opportunities as well as to replace older models of aircraft in our fleet 
we plan to either sell the aircraft which are replaced or redeploy them into the backup fleet 
typically we have financed aircraft acquired under these or similar commitments through operating lease or debt agreements 
as of the first quarter of  we have received financing commitments  subject to routine credit approval and aircraft inspection processes  in excess of the cost of aircraft to be delivered in if financing arrangements cannot be arranged and we are  therefore  prevented from taking delivery of aircraft under the commitments described above  we would forfeit nonrefundable deposits up to of the aircraft value 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain aircraft financing on favorable terms 
at the present  a vibrant secondary market for these models of aircraft exists which may allow us to sell aircraft which are not needed in our operations or which we are unable to finance 
letters of credit in january  we entered into a  letter of credit with an insurance underwriter in lieu of increasing cash deposits on our workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit may be renewed annually and reduces the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
prior to the acquisition  cj entered into three separate letters of credit totaling  with insurance underwriters in lieu of increasing cash deposits on its workers compensation and aircraft hull and liability insurance policies 
the letters of credit may be renewed annually and are presently collateralized by a deposit with a bank 

table of contents sources and uses of cash we had cash and cash equivalents of  at december   compared to  at december  cash generated by operations totaled  in compared to  in  primarily because of the improvement in operating results as described above 
days sales outstanding dso s for cbs operations  measured by comparing net revenue for the annualized previous month period to outstanding open net accounts receivable  also decreased from days at december   to days at december  cash used for investing activities totaled  in  compared to  in  reflecting the purchase price of million paid to acquire fss 
other equipment acquisitions in included a million aircraft  as well as medical interior and avionics installations and information systems hardware and software 
we also paid approximately million in deposits for future aircraft purchases and million related to the purchase of certain business assets from air medical service providers in florida and south carolina

financing activities generated  in compared to  in in we used million of term loan proceeds to repay million in term loans with another lender  as described below  and million of additional term loan proceeds to finance the acquisition of fss 
debt issuance costs of  were primarily associated with the new term loans 
in we used proceeds from new note agreements to refinance existing debt with higher interest rates and to fund the acquisition of an aircraft 
the other primary use of cash in both and was regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
senior credit facility in september  we entered into a revolving credit  term loan  and security agreement loan agreement which provides commitments for up to million of revolving loans and up to million of term loans

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility and other notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
new community based operations opening a new community based operation typically requires an investment in an additional aircraft  aviation and medical personnel  and crew quarters 
we may take possession of the additional aircraft up to three months prior to the commencement of operations in order to retrofit the aircraft for medical transport 
staff may also be hired a month in advance of the operation start date 
because of the delay between date of transport and collection of receivables from the patients or their insurers  new community based operations may not produce positive cash flow during at least the first three months of operation 
outlook for the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
community based model in the first quarter of  we opened a new base in arizona 
we also continue to explore opportunities for base expansion in each of our geographic regions 
cbs flight volume at all continuing locations during is expected to be consistent with historical levels  subject to seasonal  weather related fluctuations 
effective january   we increased prices for our cbs operations an average of approximately 
hospital based model during the fourth quarter of  one of our customers expanded to an additional satellite location and we expect three other contracts to open satellite bases in early in the first quarter of  one of our hospital contracts converted to cbs operations 
contracts with eighteen hospital customers are due for renewal in  two of which opted to contract with another provider upon expiration in the first quarter of we expect flight activity for continuing hospital contracts to remain consistent with historical levels 
products division as of december   contracts for ten hh l units  fifty mev units  and three commercial medical interiors were in process 
we also have two design contracts with the us army one for an upgraded hh m multi mission interior and one for an interim medical system 
deliveries under all contracts in process are expected to be completed by early  and remaining revenue is estimated at million 
in the first quarter of  the division received contracts totaling approximately  for the completion of three commercial medical interiors and various modular interior components 
the current us army aviation modernization plan defines a requirement for over hh m multi mission medevac units in total over an unspecified number of years 
the new multi year vii plan has funding for units  including the ten units we currently have in process  plus options for additional units to be delivered by the units funded under this plan are in addition to the units we have already completed 
there is no assurance that orders for additional units will be received in future periods 
all segments there can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate cj operations into the cbs and hbs divisions  continue to maintain flight volume or current levels of collections on receivables for cbs operations  successfully complete planned expansions of cbs and hbs operations  renew operating agreements for our hbs operations  or generate new profitable contracts for the products division 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  and depreciation and residual values 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we have from time to time experienced delays in reimbursement from third party payers 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  determinations of medical necessity  or the need for additional information 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are very complex and subject to interpretation 
we also provide services to patients who have no insurance or other third party payer coverage 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts and uncompensated care would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in statutory tax rates applicable to the company is also recognized in income in the period of the change 

table of contents depreciation and residual values in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
new accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities statement  which provides an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements 
statement permits an election to measure eligible items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis and then report unrealized gains and losses for those items in earnings 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect implementation of statement to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of our product sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and notes receivable  some of which have fixed interest rates  except  outstanding against the line of credit and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change of basis points in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  periodically we enter into interest rate risk hedges to minimize exposure to the effect of an increase in interest rates 
as of december   we were party to one interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement provides that we will pay a fixed interest rate on  of notional principal and receive a floating interest rate libor plus on the same amount of notional principal from the counterparty
