item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and highlights we are a commercial finance  investment and asset management company focused on the middle market 
we operate as a reit and provide senior and subordinate commercial loans  invest in real estate and residential mortgage assets  and engage in asset management and servicing activities 
through our commercial finance activities  our primary goal is to be the leading provider of financing to middle market businesses that require customized and sophisticated financing 
we operate through three primary commercial finance businesses corporate finance  which generally provides senior and subordinate loans through direct origination and participation in widely syndicated loan transactions  healthcare and specialty finance  which  including our healthcare net lease segment activities  generally provides first mortgage loans  asset based revolving lines of credit  and other cash flow loans to healthcare businesses and a broad range of other companies and makes investments in income producing healthcare facilities  particularly long term care facilities  and structured finance  which generally engages in commercial and residential real estate finance and also provides asset based lending to finance companies 
to optimize our reit structure  we also invest in certain residential mortgage assets which included investments in residential mortgage loans and rmbs as of december  consolidated results of operations we operate as three reportable segments commercial finance  healthcare net lease  and residential mortgage investment 
our commercial finance segment comprises our commercial lending business activities  our healthcare net lease segment comprises our direct real estate investment business activities  and our residential mortgage investment segment comprises our residential mortgage investment activities 
prior to  we operated as a single business segment as substantially all of our activity was related to our commercial finance business 
on january   we began presenting financial results through two reportable segments commercial lending investment and residential mortgage investment 
our commercial lending investment segment comprised our commercial lending and direct real estate investment business and our residential mortgage investment segment comprised all of our activities related to our investments in residential mortgage loans and rmbs 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we are presenting financial results through three reportable segments commercial finance  healthcare net lease  and residential mortgage investment 
changes have been made in the way management organizes financial information to make operating decisions  resulting in the activities previously reported in the commercial lending investment segment being disaggregated into the commercial finance segment and the healthcare net lease segment as described above 
we have reclassified all comparative prior period segment information to reflect our three reportable segments 
the discussion that follows differentiates our results of operations between our segments 
explanation of reporting metrics interest income 
in our commercial finance segment  interest income represents interest earned on our commercial loans 
although the majority of these loans charge interest at variable rates that generally adjust daily  we also have a number of loans charging interest at fixed rates 
in our healthcare net lease segment  interest income represents interest earned on cash and restricted cash 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  interest income consists of coupon interest and the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums on our investments in rmbs and mortgage related receivables  which are amortized into income using the interest method 
fee income 
in our commercial finance segment  fee income represents net fee income earned from our commercial loan operations 
fee income primarily includes the amortization of loan origination fees  net of the direct costs of origination  prepayment related fees as well as other fees charged to borrowers 
operating lease income 
in our healthcare net lease segment  operating lease income represents lease income earned in connection with our direct real estate investments 
our operating leases typically include fixed rental payments  subject to escalation over the life of the lease 
we generally project a minimum escalation rate for the leases and recognize operating lease income on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
we currently do not generate any operating lease income in our commercial finance segment or our residential mortgage investment segment 
interest expense 
interest expense is the amount paid on borrowings  including the amortization of deferred financing fees 
in our commercial finance segment  our borrowings consist of repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
in our healthcare net lease segment  our borrowings consist of a secured credit facility  mortgage debt and allocated intercompany debt 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  our borrowings consist of repurchase agreements and term debt 
the majority of our borrowings charge interest at variable rates based primarily on one month libor or commercial paper cp rates plus a margin 
currently  our convertible debt  three series of our subordinated debt  our term debt recorded in connection with our investments in mortgage related receivables and the intercompany debt within our healthcare net lease segment bear a fixed rate of interest 
deferred financing fees and the costs of issuing debt  such as commitment fees and legal fees  are amortized over the estimated life of the borrowing 
loan prepayments may materially affect interest expense on our term debt since in the period of prepayment the amortization of deferred financing fees and debt acquisition costs is accelerated 
provision for loan losses 
we record a provision for loan losses in both our commercial finance segment and our residential mortgage investment segment 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses inherent in our commercial finance portfolio and in our portfolio of residential mortgage related receivables 
as the size and mix of loans within these portfolios change  or if the credit quality of the portfolios change  we record a provision to appropriately adjust the allowance for loan losses 
we do not have any loan receivables in our healthcare net lease segment 
other income 
in our commercial finance segment  other income expense consists of gains losses on the sale of loans  gains losses on the sale of debt and equity investments  unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain investments  gains losses on derivatives  due diligence deposits forfeited  fees associated with the united states department of housing and urban development  or hud  origination activities  unrealized appreciation depreciation of our equity interests in certain non consolidated entities  third party servicing income  income from our management of various loans held by third parties and other miscellaneous fees and expenses not attributable to our commercial finance operations 
in our healthcare net lease segment  other income expense consists of gain loss on the sale of assets 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  other income expense consists of realized and unrealized appreciation depreciation on certain of our residential mortgage investments and gains losses on derivatives that are used to hedge the residential mortgage investment portfolio 
operating expenses 
in our commercial finance segment  operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees  travel  rent  insurance  depreciation and amortization  marketing and other general and administrative expenses 
in our healthcare net lease segment  operating expenses include depreciation of direct real estate investments  professional fees  an allocation of overhead expenses including compensation and benefits and other direct expenses 
in our residential mortgage investment segment  operating expenses include compensation and benefits  professional fees paid to our investment manager and other direct expenses 
income taxes 
we elected reit status under the code when we filed our tax return for the year ended december  as a reit  we generally are not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed to our shareholders that we derive from our reit qualifying activities  but are subject to corporate level tax on the earnings we derive from our trss 
we do not expect income from our healthcare net lease segment or residential mortgage investment segment to be subject to corporate level tax as all assets in these segments are considered reit qualifying assets 
a significant portion of our income from our commercial finance segment will remain subject to corporate level income tax as many of the segment s assets are originated and held in our trss 
we were responsible for paying federal  state and local income taxes on all of our income for the year ended december  adjusted earnings 
adjusted earnings represents net income as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  adjusted for certain items  including real estate depreciation  amortization of deferred financing fees  non cash equity compensation  realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in rmbs and related derivatives  unrealized gains and losses on other derivatives and foreign currencies  net unrealized gains and losses on investments  provision for loan losses  charge offs  recoveries  nonrecurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
we view adjusted earnings and the related per share measures as useful and appropriate supplements to net income and net income per share 
these measures serve as an additional measure of our operating performance because they facilitate evaluation of the company without the effects of certain adjustments determined in accordance with gaap that may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance 
adjusted earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows each computed in accordance with gaap 
instead  adjusted earnings should be reviewed in connection with net income and cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities in our consolidated financial statements  to help analyze how our business is performing 
adjusted earnings and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the reit industry 
investors should consider these differences when comparing our adjusted earnings to other reits 
operating results for the years ended december   and our results of operations in were driven primarily by a challenging credit market environment  our continued asset growth and the impact of our reit election 
as further described below  the most significant factors influencing our consolidated results of operations for were mark to market losses on our residential mortgage investment portfolio  losses on derivatives and other investments in our commercial finance segment  reduced prepayment related fee income and reduced gains on equity sales  growth in our commercial loan portfolio  increased borrowings  increased operating lease income related to our direct real estate investments  decreased operating expenses as a percentage of average assets  decreased lending spreads  and increased borrowing spreads

interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
operating expenses the increase in consolidated operating expenses from to was primarily due to a million increase in total employee compensation and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from increases in our direct real estate investments over the previous year 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to a million increase in incentive compensation  including an increase in restricted stock awards  and a million increase in employee salaries 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation comprises annual bonuses  as well as stock options and restricted stock awards  which generally have vesting periods ranging from eighteen months to five years 
the remaining increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a million increase in administrative expenses and a million increase in rent expense 
the increase in consolidated operating expenses from to was primarily due to higher total employee compensation  which increased million  or 
the higher employee compensation was attributable to an increase in our average number of employees to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   as well as higher incentive compensation  including an increase in the value of restricted stock awards and stock options granted 
for the years ended december  and  incentive compensation totaled million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation comprises annual bonuses  as well as stock options and restricted stock awards  which generally have a three to five year vesting period 
the remaining increase in operating expenses for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase of million in professional fees  an increase of million in travel and entertainment expenses and an increase of million in other general business expenses 
income taxes as a result of our decision to elect reit status beginning with the tax year ended december   we provided for income taxes for the years ended december  and  based on effective tax rates of and  respectively  for the income earned by our trss 
we did not provide for any income taxes for the income earned by our qualified reit subsidiaries for the years ended december  and we provided for income taxes on the consolidated income earned based on a  and effective tax rates in  and  respectively 
our overall effective tax for the year ended december  included the reversal of million in net deferred tax liabilities relating to reit qualifying activities  into income  in connection with our reit election 
the increased effective tax rate on consolidated net income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   is due to our trss accounting for a greater percentage of our annual consolidated net income in than in all of our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was subject to income tax  which resulted in a higher effective tax rate 
adjusted earnings adjusted earnings  as previously defined  were million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   and million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  a reconciliation of our reported net income to adjusted earnings for the years ended december  and  was as follows december  in thousands  except per share data net income add real estate depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred financing fees non cash equity compensation net realized and unrealized losses on residential mortgage investment portfolio  including related derivatives unrealized losses gains on derivatives and foreign currencies  net unrealized losses on investments  net provision for loan losses recoveries less charge offs nonrecurring items cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes adjusted earnings net income per share basic as reported diluted as reported average shares outstanding basic as reported diluted as reported adjusted earnings per share basic diluted average shares outstanding basic diluted depreciation and amortization for direct real estate investments only

comparison of the years ended december  and we have reclassified all comparative prior period segment information to reflect our three reportable segments 
the discussion that follows differentiates our results of operations between our segments 
all references to commercial loans below include loans  loans held for sale and receivables under reverse repurchase agreements 
commercial finance segment our commercial finance segment operating results for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were as follows year ended december  change change in thousands interest income fee income interest expense provision for loan losses operating expenses other income noncontrolling interests expense income taxes cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes n a net income interest income the increase in interest income was due to the growth in average interest earning assets  primarily loans  of billion  or 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the interest component of yield to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in the interest component of yield was primarily due to a decrease in our lending spread  partially offset by an increase in short term interest rates 
during the year ended december   our commercial finance spread to average one month libor was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in lending spread reflects overall trends in financial markets  the increase in competition in our markets  as well as the changing mix of our commercial finance portfolio as we continue to pursue the expanded opportunities afforded to us by our reit election 
as a reit  we can make the same  or better  after tax return on loans with a lower interest rate than on loans with a higher interest rate held prior to becoming a reit 
fluctuations in yields are driven by a number of factors  including changes in short term interest rates such as changes in the prime rate or one month libor  the coupon on new loan originations  the coupon on loans that pay down or pay off and modifications of interest rates on existing loans 
fee income the decrease in fee income was primarily the result of a decrease in prepayment related fee income  which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  prepayment related fee income contributed and to yield for the years ended december  and  respectively 
yield from fee income  including prepayment related fees  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  interest expense we fund our growth largely through debt 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of billion  or 
our cost of borrowings increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was the result of higher libor and cp rates on which interest on our term securitizations and credit facilities are based 
the increase was also the result of higher borrowing spreads and higher deferred financing fees on some of our term securitizations and on some of our credit facilities  and increases in the cost of our convertible debt following the exchange in april net finance margin net finance margin  defined as net investment income which includes interest and fee income less interest expense divided by average income earning assets  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from the year ended december  the decrease in net finance margin was primarily due to the increase in interest expense resulting from higher leverage  a higher cost of funds  and a decrease in yield on total income earning assets 
net finance spread  which represents the difference between our gross yield on income earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points from for the year ended december  gross yield is the sum of interest and fee income divided by our average income earning assets 
the decrease in net finance spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
the yields of income earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities in our commercial finance segment for the years ended december  and  were as follows year ended december  weighted net average weighted net average average investment yield average investment yield balance income cost balance income cost in thousands interest earning assets interest income fee income total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net finance spread net finance margin interest earning assets include cash  restricted cash  loans and investments in debt securities 
interest bearing liabilities include repurchase agreements  secured and unsecured credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt 
provision for loan losses the decrease in the provision for loan losses was the result of recognizing fewer allocated reserves during the year ended december  operating expenses the increase in operating expenses is due to the same factors which contributed to the increase in the consolidated operating expenses as described above 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  other expense income the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a million increase in net unrealized losses on derivative instruments  a million increase in losses on foreign currency exchange and a million decrease in the receipt of break up fees 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in income relating to our equity interests in various investees that are not consolidated for financial statement purposes  an million increase in net realized and unrealized gains in our equity investments and a million increase in gains related to the sale of loans 
our unrealized losses on derivative instruments were primarily due to the unrealized net change in the fair value of swaps used in hedging certain of our assets and liabilities to minimize our exposure to interest rate movements 
we do not apply hedge accounting to these swaps and  as a result  changes in the fair value of such swaps are recognized in gaap net income  while changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposures are not 
to correct for this asymmetry and reflect the unrealized nature of the changes in fair value of such swaps  any such unrealized losses are added to  or any unrealized gains are subtracted from  gaap earnings for purposes of determining our adjusted earnings  as previously defined 
healthcare net lease segment our healthcare net lease segment operating results for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were as follows year ended december  change change in thousands operating lease income interest expense depreciation of direct real estate investments other operating expenses other expense income noncontrolling interests expense net income loss includes interest income 
operating lease income the increase in operating lease income is due to an increase in our direct real estate investments  which are leased to healthcare industry clients through long term  triple net operating leases 
during the years ended december  and  our average balance of direct real estate investments was million and million  respectively 
interest expense the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of million  or  corresponding to an increase in the size of the portfolio

the decrease in net finance spread is attributable to the changes in its components as described above 
depreciation of direct real estate investments the increase in depreciation was due to increases in our direct real estate investments over the previous year 
as of december   we had billion in direct real estate investments  an increase of million  or  from december  other operating expenses the increase in operating expenses was consistent with the increase in operating expenses in the commercial finance segment

interest expense the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of billion  or  corresponding to an increase in the size of the portfolio 
our cost of borrowings increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the short term interest rate market index on which our cost of borrowings is based 
operating expenses the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits and professional fees 
operating expenses as a percentage of average total assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  other expense income the net loss was attributable to net realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments related to our residential mortgage investments of million and other than temporary declines in the fair value of our non agency mbs of million 
these losses were partially offset by net unrealized gains on our agency mbs of million 
the value of agency mbs relative to risk free investments was impacted during the year ended december  by the broad credit market disruption

our cost of borrowings increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was the result of rising interest rates  the use of our unsecured credit facility  which has a higher borrowing spread relative to our secured credit facilities  and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing fees 
the increase in deferred financing fees was primarily due to additional financings and higher loan prepayments on loans that secure our term debt

reflective of principles established in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
in this regard  impaired loans include those loans where we expect to encounter a significant delay in the collection of  and or shortfall in the amount of contractual payments due to us as well as loans that we have assessed as impaired  but for which we ultimately expect to collect all payments

as of december  and  we had billion and million  respectively  in direct real estate investments  which consisted primarily of land and buildings 
residential mortgage investment segment portfolio composition we invest directly in residential mortgage investments and as of december  and  our portfolio of residential mortgage investments was as follows december  in thousands mortgage related receivables residential mortgage backed securities agency non agency total represents secured receivables that are backed by adjustable rate residential prime mortgage loans 
see following paragraph for a description of these securities

we also have invested in non agency mbs  which are rmbs issued by non government sponsored entities that are credit enhanced through the use of subordination or in other ways 
substantially all of our rmbs are collateralized by adjustable rate residential mortgage loans  including hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans 
we account for our agency mbs as debt securities that are classified as trading investments and included in mortgage backed securities pledged  trading on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
we account for our non agency mbs as debt securities that are classified as available for sale and included in investments on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
the coupons on the loans underlying rmbs are fixed for stipulated periods of time and then reset annually thereafter 
the weighted average net coupon of agency mbs in our portfolio was as of december   and the weighted average reset date for the portfolio was approximately months 
the weighted average net coupon of non agency mbs in our portfolio was as of december  the fair values of our agency mbs and non agency mbs were billion and million  respectively  as of december  as of december   we had billion in mortgage related receivables secured by prime residential mortgage loans 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on these receivables was  and the weighted average contractual maturity was approximately years 
see further discussion on our accounting treatment of mortgage related receivables in note  mortgage related receivables and related owner trust securitizations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  during  we also saw decreases in the carrying value of certain of our residential mortgage investments  representing a decline of approximately in the value of the portfolio  as the market dislocation impacted the pricing relationship between mortgage assets including agency mbs that we own and low risk fixed income securities 
we actively manage the interest rate risk associated with this portfolio pursuant to a risk management strategy that is further described below in market risk management 
our investment strategy explicitly contemplates the potential for upward and downward shifts in the carrying value of the portfolio  including shifts of the magnitude that we saw during we believe that these reductions in value are temporary in nature 
given our intention to hold the investments to maturity  temporary variations in value up or down have no material impact on our investment strategy 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses as of december  and  mortgage related receivables  whose underlying mortgage loans are or more days past due or were in the process of foreclosure and foreclosed were as follows december in thousands mortgage related receivables whose underlying mortgage loans are or more days past due or are in the process of foreclosure percentage of mortgage related receivables foreclosed assets percentage of mortgage related receivables by comparison  in its january monthly summary report  fannie mae reported a serious delinquency rate sdq of for december  for conventional single family loans that are three months or more past due or in foreclosure process while  in its january monthly volume summary  freddie mac reported an sdq of for december  for comparable types of single family loans 
in connection with recognized mortgage related receivables  we recorded provisions for loan losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we charged off million of these mortgage related receivables 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively  and was recorded in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the carrying value of mortgage related receivables 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in realized losses on such mortgage related receivables 
financing we have financed our investments in rmbs primarily through repurchase agreements 
as of december  and  our outstanding repurchase agreements totaled billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   repurchase agreements that we executed had maturities of between seven days and months and a weighted average borrowing rate of 
our investments in residential mortgage related receivables were financed primarily through debt issued in connection with two securitization transactions 
as of december   the total outstanding balance of these debt obligations was billion 
the interest rates on all classes of the notes within each securitization are fixed for various periods of time and then reset annually thereafter  with a weighted average interest rate of as of december  the notes within each securitization are expected to mature at various dates through the interest rates on our repurchase agreements  securitization based debt and other financings may change at different times and in different magnitudes than the interest rates earned on our residential mortgage investments 
see market risk management below for a discussion of our interest rate risk management program related to our residential mortgage investment portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  which include funding our existing commercial loan and investment commitments  repaying borrowings  paying dividends and for other general business purposes 
commitments do not include transactions for which we have signed commitment letters but not yet signed definitive binding agreements 
our primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations  borrowings under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  subordinated debt and convertible debt  proceeds from issuances of equity and other sources 
we believe these sources of financing are sufficient to meet our short term liquidity needs 
in  we applied for an industrial loan corporation ilc charter with the state of utah and for federal deposit insurance with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
we anticipate that once operational  the ilc would enable us to obtain an additional source of funding for our loans by raising wholesale deposits in the brokered deposit market 
in march  the fdic approved our application for federal deposit insurance  subject to certain conditions 
the order issued by the fdic expires on march  if the conditions of the order have not been met 
we have requested an extension of the expiration date to december  as it has taken longer than anticipated to satisfy certain conditions in the order 
the extension request is currently pending with the fdic 
we cannot assure you that the fdic will act on our extension request prior to the expiration of the order  or if it does act  that it will approve our request 
if the fdic does not grant our extension request  the order will expire 
if the tierone merger does not close and our ilc does not become operational  we expect to continue to fund our business using our primary sources of funds identified above 
as of december   the amount of our unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients exceeded our unused funding sources and unrestricted cash by million  a decrease of  or from december  commitments do not include transactions for which we have signed commitment letters but not yet signed definitive binding agreements 
we expect that our commercial loan commitments will continue to exceed our available funds indefinitely 
our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is generally based on our clients ability to provide additional collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the additional collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements and our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing 
in some cases  our unfunded commitments do not require additional collateral to be provided by a debtor as a prerequisite to future fundings by us 
we believe that we have sufficient funding capacity to meet short term needs related to unfunded commitments 
if we do not have sufficient funding capacity to satisfy our commitments  our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create breach of contract and lender liability for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as discussed below  we have funded and expect to continue to fund purchases of residential mortgage investments primarily through repurchase agreements and term debt using leverage consistent with industry standards for these assets 
we determine our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements based on the growth rate of our portfolio and other assets 
additionally  as a reit  our growth must be funded largely by external sources of capital due to the requirement to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
we are not required to distribute the taxable income related to our trss and  therefore  have the flexibility to retain these earnings 
we intend to pay dividends equal to at least of our reit taxable income 
we may cause our trss to pay dividends to us to increase our reit taxable income  subject to the reit gross income limitations 
if we are limited in the amount of dividends we can receive from our trss  we intend to use other sources of cash to fund dividend payments 
we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital from time to time to support our growth 
we plan to continue to raise equity and  assuming the current dislocation in the credit markets improves  we plan to continue to access the debt markets for capital and to continue to explore additional sources of financing 
we expect these financings will include additional secured and unsecured credit facilities  secured and unsecured term debt  subordinated debt  repurchase agreements  equity related securities such as convertible debt and or other financing sources 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will have access to any of these funding sources in the future 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
we invest cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively 
the restricted cash primarily represents both principal and interest collections on loans collateralizing our term debt and on loans pledged to our credit facilities 
we also have restricted cash representing other items such as client holdbacks  escrows and securities pledged as collateral to secure our repurchase agreements and related derivatives 
principal repayments  interest rate swap payments  interest payable and servicing fees are deducted from the monthly principal and interest collections funded by loans collateralizing our credit facilities and term debt  and the remaining restricted cash is returned to us and becomes unrestricted at that time 
sources and uses of cash for the years ended december   and  we used cash from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
included within these amounts are cash outflows related to the purchase of loans held for sale and agency mbs that are classified as trading investments 
cash from our financing activities is generated from proceeds from our issuances of equity  borrowings on our repurchase agreements  credit facilities and term debt and from our issuances of convertible debt and subordinated debt 
our financing activities primarily use cash to repay term debt borrowings and to pay cash dividends 
for the years ended december   and  we generated cash flow from financing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
investing activities primarily relate to loan origination  purchases of residential mortgage investments  primarily mortgage related receivables  and acquisitions of direct real estate investments 
for the years ended december   and  we used cash in investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
borrowings as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings totaling billion and billion  respectively 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements  credit facilities  term debt  convertible debt and subordinated debt have supported our growth 
for a detailed discussion of our borrowings  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  our funding sources  maximum facility amounts  amounts outstanding  and unused capacity  subject to certain minimum equity requirements and other covenants and conditions as of december   were as follows maximum facility amount unused funding source amount outstanding capacity in thousands repurchase agreements credit facilities term debt other borrowings total excludes issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of december  as of december   only our series a class a r  variable funding note provides the ability for additional capacity 
as of december   our other borrowings  which includes convertible debt  subordinated debt  and mortgage debt  did not provide any ability for us to draw down additional amounts 
our overall debt strategy emphasizes diverse sources of financing  including both secured and unsecured financings 
as of december   approximately of our debt was collateralized by our loans  equity investments  direct real estate investments and residential mortgage investments and approximately was unsecured 
we intend to increase our percentage of unsecured debt over time through both unsecured credit facilities and unsecured term debt 
in april  standard and poor s issued a bbb senior unsecured debt rating and fitch ratings affirmed our bbb senior unsecured debt rating 
we may apply for ratings from other rating agencies and our goal is to improve all of these ratings over time 
as our ratings improve  we expect to be able to issue more unsecured debt relative to the amount of our secured debt 
in any case  we intend to maintain prudent levels of leverage and currently expect our debt to equity ratio on the combined portfolios of our commercial finance segment and healthcare net lease segment to remain below x 
during the second half of  we saw and continue to see negative effects from the credit market disruption in the form of a higher cost of funds on borrowings as measured by a spread to libor 
as a result  financings completed during the second half of were more expensive and provided lower leverage than similar financings we completed prior to that period 
we expect to experience greater difficulty and higher cost in securing term debt for our loans  especially commercial real estate 
we also expect to see higher borrowing costs and potentially lower advance rates on our secured credit facilities as we seek to renew them in we may not be able to renew all of those facilities at their existing commitment levels 
however  our commercial finance business model has been built around low leverage  and we do not seek to maximize leverage 
as a result  we believe we can withstand some reduction in the advance rates of our facilities and expect to retain sufficient committed capacity to fund our business 
while we expect the trend toward lower leverage and incrementally more expensive financings to continue in  we believe that these same market conditions that adversely affect us as a borrower have allowed and will continue to allow us  as a lender  to structure new loans on more favorable terms and at higher yields 
repurchase agreements as of december   we had repurchase agreements with various financial institutions  which we used to finance the purchases of rmbs during the year ended december  the terms of our borrowings pursuant to repurchase agreements typically reset every days 
during the year ended december   we negotiated longer terms for some of these repurchase agreements with several counterparties 
as a result  as of december   approximately of the borrowings outstanding under repurchase agreements had terms ranging from days to years 
agency mbs and short term liquid investments collateralize our repurchase agreements as of december  substantially all of our repurchase agreements and related derivative instruments require us to deposit additional collateral if the market value of existing collateral declines below specified margin requirements  which may require us to sell assets to reduce our borrowings 
credit facilities our committed credit facility capacities were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had nine credit facilities  seven of which are secured and two of which are unsecured  with a total of financial institutions 
we primarily use these facilities to fund our assets and for general corporate purposes 
to date  many of our assets have been held  or warehoused  in our secured credit facilities until we complete a term debt transaction in which we securitize a pool of our assets from these facilities 
we primarily use the proceeds from our term debt transactions to pay down our credit facilities  which results in increased capacity to redraw on them as needed 
as of december   our credit facilities maturity dates  committed capacities and outstanding principal balances were as follows committed principal capacity outstanding in thousands unsecured credit facility scheduled to mature february  secured credit facility scheduled to mature march  secured credit facility scheduled to mature august  secured credit facility scheduled to mature april  secured credit facility scheduled to mature april  secured credit facility scheduled to mature june  unsecured credit facility scheduled to mature march  secured credit facility scheduled to mature july  secured credit facility scheduled to mature september  total our cad million credit facility matured on february   as scheduled  and was not renewed 
at maturity  we repaid the outstanding balance using cash from our operating accounts and by drawing on other credit facilities 
we do not expect the absence of this credit facility to materially affect our liquidity 
credit facility is subject to day liquidity renewal 
on termination or maturity  amounts due under the credit facility may  in the absence of a default  be repaid from proceeds from amortization of the collateral pool 
as of december   the scheduled maturity date was march  in february  we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of the credit facility to march  as of february  our credit facilities committed capacity totaled billion 
during  we entered into four new credit facilities and amended various terms in certain of our existing credit facilities 
for further information on our credit facilities  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  term debt for our commercial finance segment  we have raised capital by securitizing pools of assets from our portfolio in permanent  on balance sheet term debt securitizations 
for the year ended december   we completed four term debt securitizations totaling billion 
as of december   the outstanding balance of our term debt securitizations was billion 
for further information on these term debt securitizations  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  owner trust term debt within our residential mortgage investment segment  we own beneficial interests in securitization trusts the owner trusts  which  in  issued billion in senior notes and million in subordinated notes backed by billion of a diversified pool of adjustable rate commercial loans 
as of december   the outstanding balance of our owner trust term debt was billion 
for further information on this debt  see note  mortgage related receivables and related owner trust securitizations  and note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  convertible debt we have raised capital through the issuance of convertible debt 
during  we issued one series of convertible debt  totaling million 
during  we also completed exchange offers related to our two series of convertible debt issued in as of december   the outstanding balance of our convertible debt was million 
for further information on our convertible debt  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  subordinated debt we have raised junior subordinated capital through the issuance of trust preferred securities 
during  we issued two series of subordinated debt  totaling million 
as of december   the outstanding balance of our subordinated debt was million 
for further information our subordinated debt  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  mortgage debt for our healthcare net lease segment  we use mortgage loans to finance certain of our direct real estate investments 
as of december   the outstanding balance of our mortgage debt was million 
for further information on such mortgage loans  see note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  debt covenants we  and some of our wholly owned subsidiaries  are required to comply with financial and non financial covenants related to our debt financings and our servicing of loans collateralizing our secured credit facilities and term debt 
failure to meet the covenants could result in the servicing being transferred to another servicer 
the notes under the trusts established in connection with our term debt include accelerated amortization provisions that require cash flows to be applied to pay the noteholders if the notes remain outstanding beyond the stated maturity dates 
equity we offer a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the drip to current and prospective shareholders 
participation in the drip allows common shareholders to reinvest cash dividends and to purchase additional shares of our common stock  in some cases at a discount from the market price 
during the years ended december  and  we received proceeds of million and million  respectively  related to the direct purchase of million and million shares of our common stock pursuant to the drip  respectively 
in addition  we received proceeds of million and million related to cash dividends reinvested in million and million shares of our common stock during the years ended december  and  respectively 
special purpose entities we use spes as an integral part of our funding activities 
we commonly service loans that we have transferred to these vehicles 
the use of these special purpose entities is generally required in connection with our secured debt financings in order to legally isolate from us loans that we transfer to these vehicles if we were to be in bankruptcy 
we also use special purpose entities to facilitate the issuance of collateralized loan obligation transactions that are further described below in commitments  guarantees contingencies 
additionally  we purchase beneficial ownership interests in residential mortgage assets that are held by special purpose entities established by third parties 
we evaluate all spes with which we are affiliated to determine whether such entities must be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
if we determine that such entities represent variable interest entities as defined by fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 fin r  we consolidate these entities if we also determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for special purpose entities for which we determine we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for our economic interests in these entities in accordance with the nature of our investments 
as further discussed in note  mortgage related receivables and related owner trust securitizations  in february  we acquired beneficial interests in two special purpose entities that acquired and securitized pools of residential mortgage loans 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these spes and  therefore  consolidated the assets and liabilities of such entities for financial statement purposes 
additionally  and as further discussed in note  borrowings  the assets and related liabilities of all special purpose entities that we use to issue our term debt are recognized on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets as of december  and commitments  guarantees contingencies as of december  and  we had unfunded commitments to extend credit to our clients of billion and billion  respectively 
commitments do not include transactions for which we have signed commitment letters but not yet signed definitive binding agreements 
we expect that our commercial loan commitments will continue to exceed our available funds indefinitely 
our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is generally based on our clients ability to provide additional collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the additional collateral s satisfaction of eligibility requirements and our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing 
in some cases  our unfunded commitments do not require additional collateral to be provided by a debtor as a prerequisite to future fundings by us 
our failure to satisfy our full contractual funding commitment to one or more of our clients could create lender liability and breach of contract liability for us and damage our reputation in the marketplace  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently believe that we have sufficient funding capacity to meet short term needs related to unfunded commitments 
we have non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment 
the leases expire over the next ten years and contain provisions for certain annual rental escalations 
a discussion of these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   we had issued million in letters of credit which expire at various dates over the next six years 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower s financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
a discussion of these contingencies is included in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  as of december   we had identified conditional asset retirement obligations primarily related to the future removal and disposal of asbestos that is contained within certain of our direct real estate investment properties 
for reasons further discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   no liability for conditional asset retirement obligations was recorded on our accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have provided a financial guarantee to a third party warehouse lender that financed the purchase of approximately million of commercial loans by a special purpose entity to which one of our other wholly owned indirect subsidiaries provides advisory services in connection with such purchases of commercial loans 
we have provided the warehouse lender with a limited guarantee under which we agreed to assume a portion of net losses realized in connection with those loans held by the special purpose entity up to a specified loss limit 
the guarantee is scheduled to expire on september   but may terminate earlier to the extent that the warehouse facility is refinanced prior to the guarantee s expiry 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we determined that we are not required to recognize the assets and liabilities of this special purpose entity for financial statement purposes as of december  this special purpose entity was formed to eventually complete collateralized loan obligation transactions for which we would serve as advisor 
in light of current conditions in the markets for third party managed collateralized loan obligation transactions  we do not expect to close this transaction in in connection with certain securitization transactions  we typically make customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets 
prior to any securitization transaction  we perform due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties 
in our capacity as originator and servicer in certain securitization transactions  we may be required to repurchase or substitute loans which breach a representation and warranty as of their date of transfer to the securitization vehicle 
from time to time we are party to legal proceedings 
we do not believe that any currently pending or threatened proceeding  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  including our cash flows 
contractual obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating leases and we have committed to contribute up to an additional million to private equity funds  and million to an equity investment 
the contractual obligations under our debt are included in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  the expected contractual obligations under our debt  operating leases and commitments under non cancelable contracts as of december   were as follows repurchase credit term convertible subordinated mortgage agreements facilities debt debt debt debt other total in thousands thereafter total the contractual obligations for credit facilities are computed based on the stated maturities of the facilities not considering optional annual renewals 
excludes net unamortized discounts of million 
the underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which could shorten the life of the term debt transactions  conversely  the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which may lengthen the life of the term debt transactions 
at our option  we may substitute loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt transactions 
in addition  the contractual obligations for our term debt transactions are computed based on the estimated life of the instrument 
the contractual obligations for the owner trust term debt are computed based on the estimated lives of the underlying adjustable rate prime residential mortgage whole loans 
the contractual obligations for convertible debt are computed based on the initial put call date 
the legal maturities of the convertible debt are and for further discussion of terms of our convertible debt and factors impacting their maturity see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the contractual obligations for subordinated debt are computed based on the legal maturities  which are between and includes operating leases and non cancelable contracts 
in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above  as of december   we had million  million and million in unrecognized tax benefits  accrued interest expense and penalties  and issued letters of credit  respectively 
as of december   sufficient information was not available to determine the settlement dates of these obligations 
we enter into derivative contracts under which we either receive cash or are required to pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheet as of december   with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts changes daily as market interest rates change 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a client s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our lending  leasing and derivative portfolios 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the client  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding with an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on management s assessment of the client and by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
our credit committee evaluates and approves credit standards and oversees the credit risk management function related to our commercial loans  direct real estate investments and other investments 
the credit committee s primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring conditions in real estate and other markets having an impact on lending activities  and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk 
commercial finance segment credit risk management for the commercial loan portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of a client based on an analysis of the client s financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a client  each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating that is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the same three factors credit  collateral  and financial performance 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client s or counterparty s financial condition  cash flow or financial situation 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral  industry and single name concentration limits 
we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a client s or counterparty s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we syndicate loan exposure to other lenders  sell loans and use other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our loan portfolio 
residential mortgage investment segment the largest asset class in our residential mortgage investment portfolio is agency mbs 
for all agency mbs we benefit from a full guarantee from fannie mae or freddie mac  and look to this guarantee to mitigate the risk of changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying the agency mbs 
however  variation in the level of credit losses may impact the duration of our investments since a credit loss results in the prepayment of the relevant loan by the guarantor 
the second largest asset class in our residential mortgage investment portfolio is mortgage related receivables 
with respect to mortgage related receivables  we are directly exposed to the level of credit losses on the underlying mortgage loans 
with respect to non agency mbs we are exposed to changes in the credit performance of the mortgage loan underlying these assets and the value or performance of our investment may be impacted by higher levels of credit losses  depending on the specific provisions of the relevant securitizations 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in commercial finance and leasing activities with clients primarily throughout the united states 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration was skilled nursing  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration was florida  which made up approximately of our commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was skilled nursing  which made up approximately of the investments 
as of december   the largest geographical concentration in our direct real estate investment portfolio was florida  which made up approximately of the investments 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from certain counterparties and monitor all exposure and collateral requirements daily 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from counterparties and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their positions net 
as of december  and  the gross positive fair value of our derivative financial instruments were million and million  respectively 
our master netting agreements reduced the exposure to this gross positive fair value by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not hold collateral against derivative financial instruments as of december  and accordingly  our net exposure to derivative counterparty credit risks as of december  and  was million and million  respectively 
market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans associated with our traditional lending activities and market risk mitigation activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans  residential mortgage investments and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk is the effect of changes in the economic value of our loans  and our other interest rate sensitive instruments and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of various types of derivative instruments 
for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments  of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  interest rate risk management commercial finance segment healthcare net lease segment interest rate risk in our commercial finance and healthcare net lease segments refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including libor based rates and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our commercial loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the prime rate or a libor based rate with almost all of our other loans bearing interest at a fixed rate 
the majority of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to libor or cp  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and investments 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities as discussed below 
the estimated decreases increases in net interest income for a month segments based on changes in the interest rates applied to the combined portfolios of our commercial finance segment and healthcare net lease segment as of december   were as follows in thousands rate change basis points for the purposes of the above analysis  we included related derivatives  excluded principal payments and assumed a advance rate on our variable rate borrowings 
approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our commercial loans had interest rate floors as of december  the loans with interest rate floors as of december   were as follows amount percentage of outstanding total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor below the interest rate floor loans with no interest rate floor total we use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate assets 
we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate and prime rate loans to one month libor 
additionally  we use offsetting interest rate caps to hedge loans with embedded interest rate caps 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate debt to one month libor 
we have also entered into spot and short dated forward exchange agreements to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk arising from foreign denominated loans 
interest rate risk management residential mortgage investment segment we are exposed to changes in interest rates in our residential mortgage investment portfolio and related financings based on changes in the level and shape of the yield curve  volatility of interest rates and mortgage prepayments 
changes in interest rates are a significant risk to our residential mortgage investment portfolio 
as interest rates increase  the market value of residential mortgage investments may decline while financing costs could rise  to the extent not mitigated by positions intended to hedge these movements 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  the market value of residential mortgage investments may increase while financing costs could decline  also to the extent not mitigated by positions intended to hedge these movements 
in addition  changes in the interest rate environment may affect mortgage prepayment rates 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  mortgage prepayment rates may decrease  thereby extending the duration of our investments 
the majority of our residential mortgage investments are collateralized with mortgages that have a fixed interest rate for a certain period of time followed by an adjustable rate period in which the adjustments are subject to annual and lifetime caps 
our liabilities include repurchase agreements indexed to an interest rate market index such as libor and securitized term debt financing through debt obligations secured by the residential mortgage loans securing our mortgage related receivables 
the estimated changes in fair value based on changes in interest rates applied to our residential mortgage investment portfolio as of december   were as follows rate change estimated decrease percentage of total basis points in fair value segment assets in thousands for the purposes of the above analysis  our residential mortgage investment portfolio includes all of our investments in residential mortgage related receivables  agency mbs  repurchase agreements with remaining terms longer than days  term debt and related derivatives as of december  in connection with our residential mortgage investments and related financings  we follow a risk management program designed to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of our residential mortgage investments due to shifts in interest rates 
specifically  we seek to eliminate the effective duration gap associated with our assets and liabilities 
to accomplish this objective  we use a variety of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  swaptions  treasury future contracts and euro dollar futures contracts 
these derivative transactions convert the short term financing of our repurchase agreements to term financing matched to the expected duration of our residential mortgage investments 
to the extent necessary and based on established risk criteria  we will adjust the mix of financing and hedges as market conditions and asset performance evolves to maintain a close alignment between our assets and our liabilities 
in addition  we have contracted with an external investment advisor  blackrock financial management  inc  to provide analytical  risk management and other advisory services in connection with interest rate risk management on this portfolio 
critical accounting estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions based on information that is available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of such statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and our critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period  or if changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to these estimates 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management periodically performs detailed reviews of this portfolio to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan losses 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the commercial loan portfolio comprises large balance  non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans determined to be individually impaired 
the allowance for loan losses is estimated by management based upon the borrower s overall financial condition  financial resources  payment history and  when applicable  the estimated realizable value of any collateral 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation for impairment of certain commercial and residential portfolios 
these allowances are based on historical experience  concentrations  current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments 
certain considerations are made in relation to the length and severity of outstanding balances 
we generally do not factor in guarantees from our capital call agreements with our borrowers private equity sponsors in determining the overall allowance for loan losses 
however  when performing the sfas no 
analysis on an individual troubled loan  we do not consider any applicable borrower guarantees when calculating our potential for a specific loss 
the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and  therefore  net income 
in this case  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for pools of commercial loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  iv adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  v considerations regarding domestic economic uncertainty  and vi overall credit conditions 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we have assigned reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation were determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  whether the loan is underwritten based on the borrower s assets  real estate or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal credit rating assigned to the loans 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of basis points applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   was as follows estimated increase change in reserve factors decrease in the basis points allowance for loan losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
if our internal credit ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan losses 
we also consider whether losses may have been incurred in connection with unfunded commitments to lend although  in making this assessment  we exclude from consideration those commitments for which funding is subject to our approval based on the adequacy of underlying collateral that is required to be presented by a borrower or other terms and conditions 
fair value of certain financial instruments a portion of our assets are accounted for at fair value  which is defined in gaap as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between willing parties  other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
investments in debt securities that are classified as trading  as well as derivative instruments that are not designated in hedging relationships  are periodically adjusted to fair value through earnings 
investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income  while loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value 
additionally  the fair value of equity investments is estimated for purposes of assessing and measuring such assets for impairment purposes 
the estimation of fair values reflects our judgments regarding appropriate valuation methods and assumptions 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
for financial instruments that are actively traded in the marketplace or whose values are based on readily available market value data  little  if any  subjectivity is applied when determining the instrument s fair value 
when observable market prices and data do not exist  significant management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in those cases  small changes in assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation 
the financial instruments we hold that require the most complex judgments and assumptions involve equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and or are not publicly traded 
each of these investments is valued using an internally developed model 
this model utilizes industry valuation benchmarks  such as multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ranging from three to ten times  depending on the industry  to determine a value for the underlying enterprise 
we reduce this value by debt outstanding to arrive at an estimated equity value of the enterprise 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the valuation date 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
income taxes we elected reit status under the code when we filed our federal tax return for the year ended december  accordingly  we generally are not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed to our shareholders that are derived from our reit qualifying activities  but are subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings we derive from our trss 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  all of our taxable income for that year would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  including any applicable alternative minimum tax 
in addition  we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost  unless we were entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions 
we are still subject to foreign  state and local taxation in various foreign  state and local jurisdictions  including those in which we transact business or reside 
in order to estimate our corporate level income taxes as a reit  we must determine the amount of our net income derived from our trss during the entire taxable year  and if any  expected undistributed reit taxable income 
if our estimates of the source of the net income are not appropriate  income taxes could be materially different from amounts reported in our quarterly and annual consolidated statements of income 
we will continue to be subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings we derive from our trss 
as more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accrued income taxes  reported as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date 
we consider many factors in filing income tax returns  including statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance  in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction 
in applying the principles of sfas  we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities 
these revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes  which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies  can materially affect our operating results for any given reporting period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  which are discussed in detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the market risk management section 
in addition  for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  equity price risk as further described in note  borrowings  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we have outstanding senior convertible debentures the debentures and senior convertible debentures the debentures 
in  we completed exchange offers related to our debentures and debentures in which we issued senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures and senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures 
in addition  in  we issued senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures and together with the   and debentures  the debentures 
our debentures and debentures would be convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
as of december   each  of the aggregate outstanding principal of the debentures and debentures would be convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
our debentures and debentures would be convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
as of december   each  of the aggregate outstanding principal of the debentures and debentures would be convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
our debentures would be convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
as of december   each  of the aggregate outstanding principal of the debentures would be convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the debentures may convert their debentures prior to maturity only if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds  the trading price of the debentures falls below a specified threshold  the debentures have been called for redemption  or specified corporate transactions occur 
in addition  in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure  the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their debentures for of the principal amount 
should we be required to repurchase the debentures at any of the redemption dates  we are required to satisfy all principal and accrued interest requirements with respect thereto in cash 
should we be required to repurchase any other series of our debentures at any of the redemption dates  or if any series of our debentures are converted  our intent is to satisfy all principal and accrued interest requirements in cash 
concurrently with our sale of the debentures  we entered into two separate call option transactions with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers  in each case covering the same number of shares as into which the debentures would be convertible 
in one transaction  we purchased a call option at a strike price equal to the conversion price of the debentures  adjusted for the effect of dividends paid on our common stock 
this option expires on march  and requires physical settlement 
we intend to exercise this call option from time to time as necessary to acquire shares that we may be required to deliver upon receipt of a notice of conversion of the debentures 
in the second transaction  we sold a call option to one of the initial purchasers for the purchase of up to million of our common shares at a strike price of approximately per share  adjusted for the effect of dividends paid on our common stock 
this call option expires at various dates from march through june and must be settled in net shares 
the net effect of entering into these call option transactions was to minimize potential dilution as a result of the conversion of the debentures by increasing the effective conversion prices of the debentures to a premium over the march  closing price of our common stock 
the call option transactions were settled at a net cost of approximately million  which we paid from the proceeds of our sale of the debentures and was included as a net reduction in shareholders equity in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with the exchange offer related to the debentures  we amended the document governing our call option transactions to provide  among other things  for those documents to relate to shares issuable upon conversion of both the debentures and the debentures
