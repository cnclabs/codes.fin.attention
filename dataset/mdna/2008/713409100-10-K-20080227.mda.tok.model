report of independent registered public accounting firm management s financial review tabular dollars in millions  except per share data our business the pepsi bottling group  inc is the world s largest manufacturer  seller and distributor of pepsi cola beverages 
when used in these consolidated financial statements  pbg  we  our  us and the company each refers to the pepsi bottling group  inc and  where appropriate  to bottling group  llc bottling llc  our principal operating subsidiary 
we have the exclusive right to manufacture  sell and distribute pepsi cola beverages in all or a portion of the us  mexico  canada  spain  russia  greece and turkey 
pbg manages and reports operating results through three reportable segments us canada  europe which includes spain  russia  greece and turkey and mexico 
as shown in the graph below  the us canada segment is the dominant driver of our results  generating of our volume  of our net revenues and of our operating income 
bar graph the majority of our volume is derived from brands licensed from pepsico  inc pepsico or pepsico joint ventures 
in some of our territories we have the right to manufacture  sell and distribute soft drink products of companies other than pepsico  including dr pepper and squirt 
we also have the right in some of our territories to manufacture  sell and distribute beverages under trademarks that we own 
the fastest growing category of our business is non carbonated beverages 
leading this category is bottled water where we have aquafina  the number one brand in the us  aqua minerale  the number one brand in russia  and electropura  the number one water in mexico 
adding to our strength in this category is lipton iced tea the number one ready to drink tea in the us  canada  russia  turkey and greece 
our non carbonated beverages portfolio also includes strong brands with starbucks frapuccino in the ready to drink coffee category  mountain dew amp and sobe adrenaline rush in the energy drink category and sobe and tropicana in the juice and juice drinks category 
we continue to add to our powerful portfolio highlighted by our focus on hydration with sobe life water  propel fitness water and g in the us see part i  item of this report for a listing of our principal products by segment 
we sell our products through either a cold drink or take home channel 
our cold drink channel consists of chilled products sold in the retail and foodservice channels 
we earn the highest profit margins on a per case basis in the cold drink channel 
our take home channel consists of unchilled products that are sold in the retail  mass merchandiser and club store channels for at home consumption 
our products are brought to market primarily through direct store delivery dsd or third party distribution  including foodservice and vending distribution networks 
the hallmarks of pbg s dsd system are speed to market  flexibility and reach  all critical factors in bringing new products to market  adding accounts to our existing base and meeting increasing volume demands 
our customers range from large format accounts  including large chain foodstores  supercenters  mass merchandisers  chain drug 
table of contents stores  club stores and military bases to small independently owned shops and foodservice businesses 
changing consumer shopping trends and on the go lifestyles are shifting more of our volume to fast growing channels such as supercenters  club and dollar stores and restaurants and other fountain accounts 
retail consolidation continues to increase the importance of our large volume customers 
in  sales to our top five retail customers represented approximately percent of our net revenues 
our goal is to help our customers grow their beverage business by making our portfolio of brands readily available to consumers at every shopping occasion  using proven methods to grow not only pepsico brand sales  but the overall beverage category 
our objective is to ensure we have the right product in the right package to fill the needs of consumers 
our sales force sells and delivers more than million eight ounce servings worldwide of pepsi cola brand beverages per day 
pbg s focus is on superior sales execution  customer service  merchandising and operating excellence 
we measure our sales in terms of physical cases sold to our customers 
each package  as sold to our customers  regardless of configuration or number of units within a package  represents one physical case 
our net price and gross margin on a per case basis are impacted by how much we charge for the product  the mix of brands and packages we sell  and the channels in which the product is sold 
for example  we realize a higher net revenue and gross margin per case on a ounce chilled bottle sold in a convenience store than on a liter unchilled bottle sold in a grocery store 
our financial success is dependent on a number of factors  including our strong partnership with pepsico  the customer relationships we cultivate  the pricing we achieve in the marketplace  our market execution  our ability to meet changing consumer preferences and the efficiency we achieve in manufacturing and distributing our products 
key indicators of our financial success are the number of physical cases we sell  the net price and gross margin we achieve on a per case basis  and our overall cost productivity  which reflects how well we manage our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other overhead costs 
the discussion and analysis throughout management s financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the classification correction discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes  including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
we use our best judgment  our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future  in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in our financial statements and related disclosures 
we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and have based our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following policies to be the most critical to the portrayal of pbg s financial condition and results of operations and require the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment 
we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and have discussed the selection of these policies and related disclosures with the audit and affiliated transactions committee of our board of directors 
other intangible assets  net and goodwill our intangible assets principally arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired and consist primarily of franchise rights  distribution rights  brands and goodwill 
these intangible assets  other than goodwill  may represent finite lived intangibles and indefinite lived intangibles 
intangible assets that are determined to have a finite life are amortized over the expected useful life  which generally ranges from five to twenty years 
for intangible assets with finite lives  evaluations for impairment are performed only if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  however  they are evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
the classification of intangibles and the determination of the appropriate life requires substantial judgment 
in determining whether our intangible assets have an indefinite useful life  we consider the following as applicable the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset  the age and market position of the related products within the territories we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth 
table of contents part ii continued of those products  and the ability and costs  if any  to renew the agreement 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level  which we determined to be the countries in which we operate 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit  as determined by its discounted cash flows  with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we evaluate intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values 
the fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights is measured using a multi period excess earnings method that is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
the fair value of our brands is measured using a multi period royalty savings method  which reflects the savings realized by owning the brand and  therefore  not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the volatility in the markets in which we conduct business 
assumptions used in our impairment analysis  such as forecasted growth rates  cost of capital and additional risk premiums used in the valuations  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our long term strategic plans 
an inability to achieve strategic business plan targets in a reporting unit  a change in our discount rate or other assumptions within our cash flow models could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets  which could then result in a material non cash impairment charge to our results of operations 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets in the years presented 
we have approximately billion of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet related to our mexico segment 
our business in mexico has performed below expectations and we did not meet our profit objectives in a non cash impairment charge could be required in the future if we do not achieve our long term expected results 
we have initiated an extensive strategic review which will allow us to assess our mexico business by brand  package  channel and geography 
we will continue to closely monitor our performance in mexico and evaluate the realizability of each intangible asset 
for further information about our goodwill and other intangible assets see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms in the united states and similar pension plans in our international locations  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the assets  liabilities and expenses associated with our international plans were not significant to our worldwide results of operations  and accordingly  assumptions  expenses  sensitivity analyses and other data regarding these plans are not included in any of the discussions provided below 
our us employees that were hired prior to january  participate in non contributory defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all full time salaried employees  as well as most hourly employees 
benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation  or stated amounts for each year of service 
effective january   newly hired salaried and non union hourly employees are not eligible to participate in these plans 
substantially all of our us employees  if they meet age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits  are eligible to participate in our postretirement medical benefit plans 
assumptions statement of financial accounting standards sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas requires that  beginning in our fiscal year  our assumptions used to measure plan assets and benefit obligations be determined as of the balance sheet date measurement date 
the standard provides two transition alternatives related to the change in measurement date 
pbg will use the two measurement approach in adopting the measurement date provision of sfas in accordingly  our expense is measured with a discount rate as of the last day of our fiscal year 
for further information regarding sfas see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions used to measure our pension and postretirement medical expenses for fiscal years  and were determined as of september of each of the prior years 
all plan assets and liabilities reported in our december  and december  consolidated balance sheets were determined as of september of each respective year 
the determination of pension and postretirement medical plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefit obligations 
significant assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets  certain employee related factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover  rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are 
table of contents based on earnings  and for retiree medical plans  health care cost trend rates 
we evaluate these assumptions on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate 
our assumptions are based upon historical experience of the plans and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
these assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and postretirement medical benefit expenses and obligations as well as related funding requirements 
the discount rates used in calculating the present value of our pension and postretirement medical benefit plan obligations are developed based on a yield curve that is comprised of high quality  non callable bonds whose maturities match the timing of our expected benefit payments 
these bonds are rated aa or better by moody s  have a principal amount of at least million  are denominated in us dollars and have maturity dates ranging from six months to thirty years 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the actual to year historical returns on asset classes in the us pension plans investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation and use them as a guide for future returns 
our current investment target asset allocation for our us pension plans is percent equity investments  of which approximately percent is invested in domestic equities and percent is invested in foreign equities 
the remaining percent of plan assets is invested primarily in fixed income securities  which is equally divided between us government and corporate bonds 
the current portfolio s target asset allocation for the and year periods had weighted average returns of percent and percent  respectively 
over time  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns 
based on the historical and estimated future returns of the pension plans portfolio  we estimate the long term rate of return on assets for pension plans to be percent in we use a market related value method that recognizes each year s asset gain or loss over a five year period 
therefore  it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the other gains and losses calculation described below 
other gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience are also determined at each measurement 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants 
net unrecognized losses  within our pension and postretirement plans in the united states  totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the cost or benefit of plan changes is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
the following tables provide the weighted average assumptions for our and pension and postretirement medical plans expense pension discount rate expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses rate of compensation increase postretirement discount rate rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate our discount rate was determined as of december  and reflects the implementation of sfas measurement date provisions 
our discount rate was determined as of september  during  excluding charges of approximately million associated with restructuring actions  our ongoing company sponsored defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan expenses totaled million 
in  our ongoing expenses will decrease by approximately million to million as a result of the combination of the following factors an increase in our weighted average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical expense from percent and percent to percent and percent  respectively  reflecting increases in the yields of long term corporate bonds comprising the yield curve 
this change in assumption will decrease our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
a change to our mortality assumption to reflect four years of projected mortality improvement will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
other factors  including changes in gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and assumptions  will decrease our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expenses by approximately million 
sensitivity analysis it is unlikely that in any given year the actual rate of return will be the same as the assumed long term rate of return of percent 
the following table provides a summary of the last three years of 
table of contents part ii continued actual returns versus the expected long term returns for our pension plans expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses actual return on plan assets net of administrative expenses sensitivity of changes in key assumptions for our pension and postretirement plans expense in are as follows discount rate a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease the expense for our pension plans in by approximately million 
the postretirement medical benefit plans have no expected return on plan assets as they are funded from the general assets of the company as the payments come due 
for further information about our pension and postretirement plans see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
casualty insurance costs due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
in the united states  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity 
this captive entity participates in a reinsurance pool for a portion of our workers compensation risk 
we provide self insurance for the workers compensation risk retained by the company and automobile risks up to million per occurrence  and product and general liability risks up to million per occurrence 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from third party providers 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability 
we evaluate these estimates periodically during the year and we believe that they are appropriate  however  an increase or decrease in the estimates or events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
for further information about our casualty insurance costs see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
as of the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which provides specific guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  reporting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize the impact of our tax positions in our financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
a change in our tax positions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize in the future 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
the us internal revenue service irs is currently examining pbg s and pepsico s joint tax returns for through march we have a tax separation agreement with pepsico  which among other provisions  specifies that pepsico maintain full control and absolute discretion for any combined or consolidated tax filings for tax periods ended on or before our initial public offering that occurred in march however  pepsico may not settle any issue without our written consent  which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld 
pepsico has contractually agreed to act in good faith with respect to all tax examination matters affecting us 
in accordance with the tax separation agreement  we will bear our allocable share of any cost or benefit resulting from the settlement of tax matters affecting us for these tax periods 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have established a tax reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years for which we have audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the statute of limitations for the irs audit of pbg s and tax returns closed on june  and as a result  we released approximately million in reserves for uncertain tax benefits relating to such audit 
the irs is currently examining pbg s tax returns for the tax years 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of an audit  we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that is more likely than not to occur 
the resolution of a matter could be recognized as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate in the period of resolution  and may also require a use of cash 

table of contents for further information about our income taxes see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our relationship with pepsico pepsico is a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and its ownership interest in our company 
more than percent of our volume is derived from the sale of brands from pepsico 
at december   pepsico owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock and percent of our outstanding class b common stock  together representing approximately percent of the voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
in addition  at december   pepsico owned percent of the equity of bottling llc 
we fully consolidate the results of bottling llc and present pepsico s share as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 
on march   together with pepsico we formed pr beverages limited pr beverages  a venture that will enable us to strategically invest in russia to accelerate our growth 
pbg contributed its business in russia to pr beverages  and pepsico entered into bottling agreements with pr beverages for pepsico beverage products sold in russia on the same terms as in effect for pbg immediately prior to the venture 
pepsico also granted pr beverages an exclusive license to manufacture and sell the concentrate for such products 
we fully consolidate pr beverages into our financial statements and record minority interest expense for pepsico s percent share of the venture s net income 
increases in gross profit and operating income resulting from the consolidation of the venture are offset by minority interest expense related to pepsico s share 
minority interest expense is recorded below operating income 
for further information about pr beverages see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our business is conducted primarily under beverage agreements with pepsico  including a master bottling agreement  non cola bottling agreements  distribution agreements and a master syrup agreement 
these agreements provide pepsico with the ability  at its sole discretion  to establish prices  and other terms and conditions for our purchase of concentrates and finished products from pepsico 
pepsico provides us with bottler funding to support a variety of trade and consumer programs  such as consumer incentives  advertising support  new product support and vending and cooler equipment placement 
the nature and type of programs  as well as the level of funding  vary annually 
additionally  under a shared services agreement  we obtain various services from pepsico  which include services for information technology maintenance and the procurement of raw materials 
we also provide services to pepsico  including facility and credit and collection support 
because we depend on pepsico to provide us with concentrate which we use in the production of carbonated soft drinks and non carbonated beverages  bottler incentives and various services  changes in our relationship with pepsico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
for further information about our relationship with pepsico and its affiliates see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements

restructuring charges organizational realignment in the third quarter of  we announced a restructuring program to realign the company s organization to adapt to changes in the marketplace  improve operating efficiencies and enhance the growth potential of the co mpany s product portfolio 
we anticipate the program to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of as part of the organizational realignment we reduced the number of business units in the us canada from eight to six to centralize decision making and increase speed to market  resulting in the elimination of approximately positions 
the restructuring program also resulted in the elimination of approximately positions in mexico and europe  many of which were hourly frontline positions in warehouse and production 
in connection with the elimination of positions primarily in mexico  we made approximately million of employee benefit payments pursuant to existing unfunded termination indemnity plans 
these benefit payments have been accrued for in previous periods and  therefore  are not included in our estimated cost for this program 
we expect to recognize annual cost savings of approximately million as a result of the program 
the organizational realignment is expected to cost to million over the course of the program  which is primarily for severance  relocation and other employee related benefits 
as of december   we had eliminated approximately positions across all reporting segments and incurred a pre tax charge of approximately million  which was recorded in selling  delivery  and administrative expenses 
the remaining costs are expected to be incurred in the first quarter of substantially all costs associated with the organizational realignment required cash payments in or will require cash payments in the total after tax cash expenditures  including payments made pursuant to existing unfunded indemnity plans  are expected to be approximately million  of which million was recognized in  with the balance to occur in other restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  we implemented and completed an additional phase of restructuring actions to improve operating efficiencies 
in addition to the amounts discussed above  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million in selling  delivery and administrative expenses  primarily related to employee termination costs in mexico  and eliminated an additional positions as a result of this phase of the restructuring 
we expect to recognize annual cost savings of approximately million 
full service vending rationalization due to changing customer and consumer demands we evaluated the investment returns on our full service vending fsv business in the us and canada 
our fsv business portfolio consists of accounts whereby pbg stocks and services vending equipment 
our review identified opportunity to improve our return on these assets 
on october   we adopted a fsv rationalization plan  which we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of  to rationalize our vending asset base by disposing of older underperforming assets and redeploying certain assets to higher 
table of contents return accounts 
this action is part of the company s broader initiative designed to improve operating income margins of our fsv business 
over the course of the fsv rationalization plan  we will incur a pre tax charge of to million  the majority of which is non cash  including costs associated with the removal of these assets from service  disposal costs and redeployment expenses 
during the fourth quarter of we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with this action 
the pre tax charge  the majority of which is non cash  is recorded in selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
for further information about our restructuring charges and fsv rationalization see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements

in our us canada segment  volume was unchanged  driven primarily by flat volume in the us our performance in the us reflected growth in the take home channel of approximately one percent  driven primarily by growth in supercenters  wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers 
this growth was offset by a decline of three percent in the cold drink channel  as a result of declines in our small format and foodservice channels 
from a brand perspective  our us non carbonated portfolio increased six percent  reflecting significant increases in trademark lipton and water coupled with strong growth in energy drinks 
the growth in our us non carbonated portfolio was offset by declines in our carbonated soft drink csd portfolio of three percent  driven primarily by declines in trademark pepsi

volume increases in russia were strong in all channels  led by growth of percent in our non carbonated portfolio 
in our mexico segment  overall volume increased one percent  driven primarily by the bepusa acquisition  partially offset by a decrease of two percent in base business volume 
this decrease was primarily attributable to four percent declines in both csd and jug water volumes  mitigated by nine percent growth in bottled water and greater than percent growth in non carbonated beverages

our effective tax rate for and was percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the reversal of tax contingency reserves of approximately million relating to the completion of the irs audit of pbg s income tax returns 
in addition  during  changes to the income tax laws in canada  turkey and certain jurisdictions within the us were enacted 
these tax law changes required us to re measure our net deferred tax liabilities using lower tax rates which decreased our income tax expense by approximately million during the year ended december   resulting in an increase in net income of million after the impact of minority interest

capital expenditures increased million in as a result of the strategic investments described above 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash come from our operating activities and the issuance of debt and bank borrowings 
we believe that these cash inflows will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  benefit plan contributions  acquisitions  share repurchases  dividends and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment 
long term debt activities we had no significant long term debt activities during on march   bottling llc issued million of senior notes due the notes

the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and the senior notes due october of the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank on an equal basis with all of bottling llc s other existing and future unsecured indebtedness and are senior to all of bottling llc s future subordinated indebtedness 
short term debt activities in october  we amended and restated our existing million committed revolving credit facility to increase the credit limit to billion and provide for a new maturity date of october agreement

market risks and cautionary statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include the risk associated with the price of commodities purchased and used in our business  interest rates on outstanding debt and currency movements impacting our non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the business environment in which we operate 
we regularly assess all of these risks and have policies and procedures in place to protect against the adverse effects of these exposures 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the applicable rates and prices 
to achieve this objective  we have derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our derivative instruments 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on our financial instruments 
we performed the sensitivity analyses for hypothetical changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in our stock price on our unfunded deferred compensation liability 
information provided by these sensitivity analyses does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor were held constant 
as a result  the reported changes in the values of some financial instruments that are affected by the sensitivity analyses are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge 

table of contents commodity price risk we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use future and option contracts to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices related primarily to anticipated purchases of raw materials and energy used in our operations 
with respect to commodity price risk  we currently have various contracts outstanding for commodity purchases in  which establish our purchase prices within defined ranges 
we estimate that a percent decrease in commodity prices with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of million at december  and december  interest rate risk interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt 
we effectively converted million of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates on our interest rate swaps and other variable debt would change our interest expense 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and cash equivalents with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase to net interest expense of million in and foreign currency exchange rate risk in  approximately percent of our operating income came from outside the united states 
social  economic and political conditions in these international markets may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the overall risks to our international businesses include changes in foreign governmental policies and other social  political or economic developments 
these developments may lead to new product pricing  tax or other policies and monetary fluctuations that may adversely impact our business 
in addition  our results of operations and the value of the foreign assets and liabilities are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our businesses outside the us into us dollars affects year over year comparability 
we generally have not hedged against these types of currency risks because cash flows from our international operations have been reinvested locally 
we have foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar cash flows in our canadian business 
a percent weaker us dollar against the canadian dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of these contracts of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in the fair value from the prior year is due to a decrease in the outstanding forward exchange contracts at december  in  we entered into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of intercompany receivable balances that are denominated in mexican pesos 
a percent weaker us dollar against the mexican peso  with all variables held constant  would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of these contracts at december  foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transaction gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translation gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
beginning in  turkey was no longer considered highly inflationary  and changed its functional currency from the us dollar to the turkish lira 
unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price  as well as price changes in certain other equity and fixed income investments 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust the employee s deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
therefore  changes in compensation expense as a result of changes in our stock price are substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of these contracts 
we estimate that a percent unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have reduced the fair value from these forward contract commitments by million in and cautionary statements except for the historical information and discussions contained herein  statements contained in this annual report on form k and in the annual report to the shareholders may constitute forward looking statements as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans

advertising support represents agreed upon funding to assist us for the cost of media time and promotional materials and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
advertising support that represents reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable media cost  is recorded as a reduction to advertising and marketing expenses within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
total bottler incentives recognized as adjustments to net revenues  cost of sales and selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations were as follows fiscal year ended net revenues cost of sales selling  delivery and administrative expenses total bottler incentives certain corrections were made to prior years disclosure of reported bottler incentives recognized in cost of sales 
total bottler incentives for and have been reduced by approximately million and million  respectively 
the correction had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company grants a combination of stock option awards and restricted stock units to our middle and senior management and our board of directors 
see note for further discussion on our share based compensation 
shipping and handling costs our shipping and handling costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations are recorded primarily within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
such costs recorded within selling  delivery and administrative expenses totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
foreign currency gains and losses and currency translation we translate the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  while we translate the statements of operations at the average rates of exchange during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of minority interest on our consolidated balance sheets 
transactional gains and losses arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in foreign currency that is different from the local functional currency are included in net other non operating income expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transactional gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translational gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
beginning january   turkey was no longer considered to be a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms in the us and other similar plans in our international locations  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 

table of contents the assets  liabilities and expense associated with our international plans were not significant to our results of operations  and accordingly other assumptions regarding these plans are not included in the discussion below 
the discount rate assumption used in our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans accounting is based on current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt as determined on each measurement date 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider the actual to year historical returns on asset classes in the pbg sponsored pension plans investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation and use them as a guide for future returns 
we use a market related value method that recognizes each year s asset gain or loss over a five year period 
therefore  it takes five years for the gain or loss from any one year to be fully included in the other gains and losses calculation 
other gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience are also determined at each measurement 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants 
we amortize prior service costs on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits 
see note for further discussion on our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
as of the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which provides specific guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  reporting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize the impact of our tax positions in our financial statements if those positions will more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merit of the position 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize in the future 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
see note for further discussion on our income taxes 
earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock that would then participate in net income 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities not exceeding three months at the time of purchase 
the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximate the amounts shown on our consolidated balance sheets due to their short term nature 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to non payment  bankruptcies and sales returns 
our accounting policy for the provision for doubtful accounts requires reserving an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable  sales return trend analysis  detailed analysis of high risk customers accounts  and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the cost of our inventory is generally computed on the first in  first out method 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment pp e at cost  except for pp e that has been impaired  for which we write down the carrying amount to estimated fair market value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
other intangible assets  net and goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
the company completed the annual impairment test for in the fourth quarter and no impairment was determined 
other intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which we expect to receive economic benefit  which generally ranges from five to twenty years  and are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of the expected life will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset 
in our evaluation of these intangible assets  we consider the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset  the age and market position of the products within the territories we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth of those products  and costs  if any  to renew the agreement 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques 

table of contents part ii continued casualty insurance costs in the united states  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity 
this captive entity participates in a reinsurance pool for a portion of our workers compensation risk 
we provide self insurance for the workers compensation risk retained by the company and automobile risks up to million per occurrence  and product and general liability risks up to million per occurrence 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs was million as of december  of which million was reported in accounts payable and other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our liability for casualty costs was million of which million was reported in accounts payable and other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
minority interest minority interest is recorded for the entities that we consolidate but are not wholly owned by pbg 
at december   pbg owned percent of bottling llc and pepsico owned the remaining percent 
additionally  pepsico has a percent ownership interest in the pr beverages venture  a consolidated venture under bottling llc 
minority interest recorded in our consolidated financial statements is primarily comprised of pepsico s share of the consolidated net income and net assets of bottling llc as well as pepsico s share of the net income and net assets of the pr beverages venture 
treasury stock we record the repurchase of shares of our common stock at cost and classify these shares as treasury stock within shareholders equity 
repurchased shares are included in our authorized and issued shares but not included in our shares outstanding 
we record shares reissued using an average cost 
at december   we had million shares authorized under our share repurchase program 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in october  we have repurchased approximately million shares and have reissued approximately million for stock option exercises 
financial instruments and risk management we use derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements associated with commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments are generally designated and accounted for as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge 
the derivative s gain or loss recognized in earnings is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 
if a fair value or cash flow hedge were to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or were terminated  it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled  but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively 
if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist  any associated amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings at that time 
we also may enter into a derivative instrument for which hedge accounting is not required because it is entered into to offset changes in the fair value of an underlying transaction recognized in earnings economic hedge 
these instruments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
liabilities related to commitments and contingencies are recognized when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable

for the year ended december   there were no shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation 
for the years ended december  and december   options to purchase million shares and million shares  respectively  were excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average market price of the company s common shares during the related periods and the effect of including the options in the computation would be antidilutive 
note share based compensation accounting for share based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
among its provisions  sfas r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company utilized the intrinsic value based method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  and adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value based method of accounting  compensation expense for stock options granted to the company s employees was measured as the excess of the quoted market price of common stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock 
the company s policy is to grant stock options at fair value on the date of grant and as a result  no compensation expense was historically recognized for stock options 

table of contents part ii continued the company adopted sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective approach 
under this transition method  the measurement and our method of amortization of costs for share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same amortization method that was previously used in our sfas pro forma disclosure 
results for prior periods have not been restated as provided for under the modified prospective approach 
for equity awards granted after the date of adoption  we amortize share based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting term 
compensation expense is recognized only for share based payments expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures  both at the date of grant as well as throughout the vesting period  based on the company s historical experience and future expectations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense amounts was recognized based on estimated forfeitures 
total share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is as follows fiscal year ended total share based compensation expense income tax benefit minority interest net income impact the adoption of sfas r reduced our basic earnings per share by and our diluted earnings per share by for both the fiscal years ended and the following table shows the effect on net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  had compensation expense been recognized based upon the estimated fair value on the grant date of awards  in accordance with sfas  as amended by sfas no

table of contents expected term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time employees will retain their vested stocks until exercise 
due to the lack of historical experience in stock option exercises  we estimate expected term utilizing a combination of the simplified method as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
and historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility of its traded options 
the expected dividend yield is management s long term estimate of annual dividends to be paid as a percentage of share price 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of pbg stock on the date of grant 
we receive a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises when the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the stock price when the options are exercised over the exercise price of the options 
additionally  we receive a tax deduction for restricted stock units equal to the fair market value of pbg s stock at the date of conversion to pbg stock 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company presented all tax benefits resulting from equity awards as operating cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the grant date fair value for these equity awards to be classified as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows  on a prospective basis 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in tax benefits from the exercise of equity awards in the consolidated statements of cash flows  of which million was recorded as excess tax benefits as an increase in cash from financing with the remaining being recorded in cash from operations 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the incentive plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including the use of derivatives 
certain of these derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges we are subject to market risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use future and option contracts to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices related primarily to anticipated purchases of raw materials and energy used in our operations 
these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we are subject to foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar purchases in our canadian business 
these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
in anticipation of the million debt issuance in march  bottling llc entered into treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against adverse interest rate changes 
we recognized million as a deferred gain before taxes and minority interest reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl resulting from these treasury rate contracts 
the deferred gain is released to match the underlying interest expense on the debt 
in previous years  we have entered into additional treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against adverse interest rate changes on certain debt financing arrangements 
these agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument is deferred in aocl until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a fair value change on a qualifying cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately and is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 

table of contents part ii continued the following summarizes activity in aocl related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges held by the company during the applicable periods before net of minority minority interest minority interest and taxes interest taxes and taxes accumulated net gains as of december  net changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges net gains reclassified from aocl into earnings accumulated net gains as of december  net changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges net gains reclassified from aocl into earnings accumulated net gains as of december  net changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges net losses reclassified from aocl into earnings accumulated net gains as of december  assuming no change in the commodity prices and foreign currency rates as measured on december   million of deferred gain will be recognized in earnings over the next months 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these contracts was not material to our results of operations in  or fair value hedges we finance a portion of our operations through fixed rate debt instruments 
we effectively converted million of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these interest rate swaps meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting and are percent effective in eliminating the market rate risk inherent in our long term debt 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
during  the fair value of the interest rate swap liability decreased from million at december  to million at december  in  the fair value change of our swaps and debt was recorded in other liabilities and long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency hedges in  we entered into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of intercompany receivable balances that are denominated in mexican pesos 
we recognized million of a loss in  resulting from changes in the fair value of these forward exchange contracts 
the earnings impact from these instruments is classified in other non operating income expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price as well as price changes in other equity and fixed income investments 
participating employees in our deferred compensation program can elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to be paid out on a future date or dates 
as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
at december   we had a prepaid forward contract for  shares at a price of  which was accounted for as an economic hedge 
this contract requires cash settlement and has a fair value at december   of million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet

table of contents pension postretirement weighted average assumptions expense discount rate liability discount rate expected return on plan assets n a n a n a expense rate of compensation increase liability rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets is presented after administration expenses 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the actual to year historical returns on asset classes in pbg sponsored pension plans investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation and use them as a guide for future returns 
over time  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns 
based on the historical and estimated future returns of the pension plans portfolio  we estimate the long term rate of return on assets for our pension plans to be percent in funding and plan assets allocation percentage target actual actual asset category equity securities debt securities the table above shows the target allocation and actual allocation 
target allocations of pbg sponsored pension plans assets reflect the long term nature of our pension liabilities 
none of the assets are invested directly in equity or debt instruments issued by pbg  pepsico or any bottling affiliates of pepsico  although it is possible that insignificant indirect investments exist through our broad market indices 
pbg sponsored pension plans equity investments are diversified across all areas of the equity market ie  large  mid and small capitalization stocks as well as international equities 
pbg sponsored pension plans fixed income investments are also diversified and consist of both corporate and us government bonds 
the pension plans do not invest directly in any derivative investments 
the pension plans assets are held in a pension trust account at our trustee s bank 
pbg s pension investment policy and strategy are mandated by pbg s pension investment committee pic and are overseen by the pbg board of directors compensation and management development committee 
the plan assets are invested using a combination of enhanced and passive indexing strategies 
the performance of the plan assets is benchmarked against market indices and reviewed by the pic 
changes in investment strategies  asset allocations and specific investments are approved by the pic prior to execution 
health care cost trend rates we have assumed an average increase of percent in in the cost of postretirement medical benefits for employees who retired before cost sharing was introduced
