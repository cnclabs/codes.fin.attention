item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the maker of bidil  which is indicated for the treatment of heart failure in self identified black patients as an adjunct to current standard therapies 
bidil is an orally administered fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride 
the fda approved bidil in june and we commercially launched bidil in july we are currently a party to an exclusive five year manufacturing and supply agreement with schwarz pharma manufacturing  inc for the three times daily immediate release dosage formulation of bidil 
since our inception  we have mainly funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments from our collaborative partners  and more recently  sales of bidil 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of million as of december  based upon our determination that the successful commercialization of bidil requires a magnitude of resources that we cannot currently allocate to the program  as well as our plans to conserve cash in order to pursue the development of bidil xr  an extended release formulation of bidil  in january we discontinued active promotional activities for bidil 
we concurrently implemented a restructuring plan that includes the elimination of approximately positions by the end of february  reducing headcount from approximately to  with an additional reduction in headcount to approximately positions anticipated by the end of april although we have discontinued promotional activities related to bidil  we intend to continue to manufacture and sell bidil and maintain the product on the market for patients through normal wholesale and retail channels 
in conjunction with implementing our january restructuring plan  we intend to evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives for our business  which may include the divestiture of our bidil and bidil xr business and or our nitric oxide patent portfolio  a merger or consolidation with another company  or other comparable arrangements 
our january restructuring follows the elimination of our discovery research program in march and the replacement of our sales force with a small team of senior cardiovascular business managers in october the january restructuring also follows our efforts in august to deploy an expanded field organization designed to focus on selected prescriber targets 
bidil is an orally administered medicine that is presently dosed three times daily 
we are seeking to develop bidil xr as a once daily formulation 
based upon discussions with the fda  we are pursuing bioequivalence and pharmacodynamic clinical trials comparing bidil xr formulations to bidil 
in connection with our efforts to develop bidil xr  in february we entered into a license agreement with elan  pursuant to which elan granted to us an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license to import  use  offer for sale and sell an oral capsule formulation incorporating specified technology owned or controlled by elan and containing  as its sole active combination of ingredients  the combination of the active drug substances isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride  including bidil xr 
in consideration for the grant of the license  we have agreed to pay elan royalties that are calculated by reference to annual net sales parameters set forth in the agreement 
in addition  we have also agreed to pay elan specified amounts upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestone events set forth in the agreement 
in the near term  the key drivers of our success will be our ability to maintain sales of bidil following our january discontinuation of promotional activities related to bidil  evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives for our business which may include the divestiture of our bidil and bidil xr business and or our nitric oxide patent portfolio  a merger or consolidation with another company  or other comparable arrangements  and successfully advance the development of bidil xr 
as a result of our restructurings in march and october  our research  development and commercialization expenses declined by approximately million in as compared to  due primarily to a decrease in employee headcount and research and commercialization activities  partially offset by an increase in ongoing development expenses related to bidil xr 
we estimate that we will record charges related to our january restructuring of approximately million in the first half of as a result of our january restructuring  we estimate that our operating expenses related to research and development and sales  general and administrative functions  excluding restructuring charges  for the year ending december  will be approximately million to million  excluding cost of product sales but including share based compensation expense 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that our our existing sources of liquidity and the cash expected to be generated from future sales of bidil  together with the significant reduction in expenditures as a result of our january restructuring  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to incur operating expenses going forward primarily related to our continued development of bidil xr and to keeping bidil available on the market 
we expect to fund a substantial portion of our operating expenses through ongoing bidil sales 
however  the elimination of our sales force and discontinuation of our promotional activities for bidil could result in a decline in bidil prescriptions by healthcare providers and could also adversely affect third party payors willingness to provide reimbursement at favorable levels 
if physicians do not continue to prescribe bidil in sufficient quantities  and or if managed care providers remove bidil from a preferential reimbursement tier on their plan formularies  then our future revenue from sales of bidil will decline significantly  and we may not achieve sufficient working capital to fund our continued operations  including with respect to our planned development of bidil xr 
as we evaluate strategic options intended to maximize shareholder value for our company  we intend to execute on our business strategy of ceasing active promotional efforts for bidil while devoting substantially all of our resources to supporting ongoing bidil prescriptions and the continued development of bidil xr 
if we are unable to successfully consummate one or more strategic transactions relating to our business  we may not have sufficient capital to execute on our current business plan and could be required to further curtail or cease our operations 
financial operations overview revenue 
our first commercial product  bidil  was launched in july  and generated product sales of million for the year ended december  prior to the launch of bidil  all of our revenue had been derived from license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we received from our corporate collaborators 
we discontinued active promotion of bidil in january research and development 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities and bidil medical support costs 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs during the years ended december   and in some cases  we have not provided program costs because prior to we did not track and accumulate cost information by research program 
bidil 
from may to july  we enrolled  patients at clinical sites in the united states in our phase iii clinical trial for bidil 
we halted the trial in july due to a significant survival benefit in the preliminary data for patients taking bidil 
the fda approved bidil on june   and we launched bidil in july the total cost for the bidil a heft trial was approximately million 
bidil xr 
the current formulation of bidil is an immediate release tablet that must be taken three times daily 
we are currently pursuing the development of bidil xr  an extended release formulation of bidil  that could be taken once a day 
to date  we have incurred approximately million in connection with the development of bidil xr 
preliminary clinical studies of bidil xr demonstrated proof of principle  and we commenced clinical development of bidil xr in october we will need to conduct additional formulation studies and trials in order to finalize the formulation prior to the bioequivalence trials 
we anticipate that we will finalize the bidil xr formulation in assuming that the bidil xr formulation is successfully finalized  we anticipate initiating pivotal bioequivalence trials and then filing the new drug application in or because of its stage of development  and the uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical development generally  we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize bidil xr 
nitric oxide stents 
we formerly had a research program with boston scientific corporation  or boston scientific  to develop cardiovascular stents enhanced with a bio compatible polymer that is capable of releasing nitric oxide 
in accordance with the terms of our agreement with boston scientific  the research term expired in december we are not presently engaging in any internal research and development activities with respect to cardiovascular stents 
other discovery research 
we have used our know how and expertise in nitric oxide to develop drug candidates that are nitric oxide enhancing versions of existing medicines in the areas of cardiovascular  gastrointestinal anti inflammatory and pulmonary medicine 
these studies have not progressed beyond a discovery stage of testing  and it remains speculative whether the addition of nitric oxide will result in an improved clinical profile of these medicines 
we are currently seeking out licensing opportunities for these product candidates  and are not presently engaging in any internal research and development activities with respect to these drugs 
we cannot be certain if we will be able to secure out licensing arrangements for these product candidates on favorable terms  if at all 
as such  we are not able to estimate when material cash inflows from product sales  milestones and royalties could commence  if ever 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in sales and marketing  executive  finance  investor relations  accounting  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  costs for public relations  advertising and promotion services  professional fees for legal and accounting services  and costs related to our former arrangements with a contract sales organization 
non operating income 
non operating income includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and interest expense associated with our long term debt 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in product sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in the increase in product sales is due to increased shipments of bidil as bidil has continued to gain market acceptance 
we commercially launched bidil in july research and development revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to for and million for the million  or  increase in research and development revenues in compared to was due to our non exclusive licensing of certain non strategic intellectual property in october for which we have no continuing obligation 
we had research and development revenue in due to the termination of the research term under our collaboration agreement with boston scientific in december all such revenue related to this collaboration agreement had been fully recognized through december cost of product sales 
cost of product sales for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or  increase in cost of product sales in compared to is primarily due to a million increase in inventory impairment charges of million in compared to million in the million  or  decrease in cost of product sales in compared with was primarily due to a decrease of million in inventory impairment charges related to commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and contractual purchase commitments 
the charges were due to our current estimate of inventory requirements based on our sales forecast 
offsetting the decrease in inventory impairment charges were higher product costs and higher royalty costs due to increased sales 
research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or  decrease in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily the result of decreased clinical and medical expenses needed to support bidil  a decrease in payroll and benefits due to our restructuring in march  and decreases in the areas of continuing medical education  clinical advisory boards  medical services fees  publications  stock based compensation expense  and other various contracted services totaling million 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million related to the development of bidil xr 
the million  or  decrease in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily the result of decreased clinical and medical expenses needed to support bidil  a decrease in payroll and benefits due to our restructuring in march  and decreases in the areas of continuing medical education  clinical advisory boards  medical services fees  publications and other various contracted services totaling million 
these decreases were offset by increases in the amount of million for stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  in january the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expense for our principal research and development programs for the fiscal years ended december   and december  research and development program bidil    bidil xr   nitric oxide enhancing cardiovascular compounds  nitric oxide stents   other discovery research    total research and development expense   sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in the million  or  decrease in sales  general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to the following decreases million reduction for lower salary and benefit costs from the restructuring of our sales force in october  offset by the hiring of a smaller  more experienced sales force in mid  million reduction in advertising and promotional services and public relations  million reduction in rent expenses  million reduction in stock based compensation expense  and million reduction in consulting expenses 
the million  or  decrease in sales  general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily due to a decrease of million related to the restructuring of our sales force and million for advertising and promotional services and public relations 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million for stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r in january restructurings 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a restructuring of our discovery research operations to better align costs with revenue and operating expectations 
the restructuring charges pertained to employee severance and impairment of assets and were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas in connection with the restructuring  we terminated employees in our discovery research group  or approximately of our workforce  resulting in a charge of million 
all employees were terminated as of march  as a result of terminating these employees  we recorded an impairment charge for certain research laboratory equipment  computer equipment  and furniture and fixtures aggregating million  for which the future use was uncertain 
these assets were written down to their fair value utilizing a third party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the assets based on current market quotes and the current condition of the equipment  furniture and fixtures 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million comprised of severance benefits of million and impairment charges of million for certain research and development equipment  leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computers 
the restructuring charges were recorded in accordance with sfas and sfas this restructuring program included the elimination of sales personnel and eight general and administrative and research and development personnel 
these employees were terminated in october  and no employee remained employed at december  due to these actions  certain research and development equipment  leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computers became impaired 
these assets were written down to the fair value based on either a third party quote  or the estimated discounted cash flows they would generate over the remaining economic life 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to vacating our former headquarters location 
the charge was recorded pursuant to sfas in march  we entered into an assignment of lease and assumption agreement  which we refer to as the assignment agreement  with shire human genetic therapies  inc  or shire  pursuant to which we assigned our lease for office and laboratory space located at spring street in lexington  massachusetts  which we refer to as the spring street lease 
pursuant to the terms of the assignment agreement  we agreed to pay shire the amount of approximately million as consideration for shire s assumption of the spring street lease 
in addition to this charge  we incurred million in expenses primarily related to real estate brokerage fees and clean up costs 
offsetting these charges was a reversal of million in accrued rent related to the spring street lease 
all amounts were paid as of june  stock based compensation expense 
we follow the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
compensation cost recognized subsequent to december  includes a compensation cost for all stock based payments granted but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and b compensation cost for all stock based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
such amounts have been reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our net loss and net loss per share were million and for and million and for  respectively  these amounts are higher than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb as of december   the total compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards to employees not yet recognized in the statement of operations was approximately million  which we will recognize over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  total compensation cost related to restricted stock awards as of december  is million  which will be recognized over years 
non operating income 
non operating income decreased to million in compared to million in and million in the million  or  decrease in non operating income in compared to was primarily related to a million decrease in interest income due to lower average investment balances  offset by million in lower interest expense associated with our debt because the principal balance due on the debt was lower in the million  or  decrease in non operating income in compared to was primarily related to million in higher interest expense associated with our debt  which was outstanding during the entire period compared to six months in  offset by million in higher interest income 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have primarily funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments from our collaborative partners and  more recently  sales of bidil 
as of december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of equity securities  primarily as the result of the sale of million of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in november  net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering in december  net proceeds of million from our registered direct offering in january  and net proceeds of million from our registered direct offering in may at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during the year ended december   operating activities used cash of million  primarily due to a net loss of million and an increase of million in accounts receivable  offset by a decrease in inventory of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
in addition  we had non cash expenses of million in stock based compensation expense and million in depreciation and amortization 
our use of cash decreased significantly in compared to our use of cash of million in  driven by a net loss in of million and million for payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses  this is offset by reductions to accounts receivable of million and million of prepaid expenses and non cash charges of million for depreciation expense  stock based compensation expense and fixed asset impairment charges 
during the year ended december   investing activities used cash of million primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million  offset by million in cash received on the disposal of fixed assets and million of restricted cash received by us due to the assignment of the spring street lease 
in  investing activities provided cash of million  primarily due to sales and maturities of marketable securities to fund operations 
we do not expect to invest significant amounts in capital expenditures during during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of million due to net proceeds of million from our registered direct offering  and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans  offset by million in principal payments on long term debt 
in  financing activities provided cash of million due to net proceeds of million from our registered direct offering  and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans  offset by million in principal payments on long term debt 
on june   we borrowed i million from oxford finance corporation  or oxford  and ii million from general electric capital corporation  or gecc  pursuant to the terms of promissory notes made by us with both oxford and gecc  respectively 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and are payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and accrued interest  beginning july  the notes are secured by a security interest in all our personal property and fixtures with the exception of any intellectual property or products acquired  whether by purchase  license or otherwise  on or after the execution of the notes 
the agreements that we entered into with each of oxford and gecc in connection with the notes also contain a material adverse change clause with both oxford and gecc 
under this clause  if oxford or gecc reasonably determine that our ability to repay the notes has been materially impaired  we would be considered in default 
as of december   we were in compliance with this clause and million of principal remained outstanding and unpaid 
we expect that the promissory notes will be fully paid by june  at march   we held approximately million of investments with an auction reset feature  referred to as auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured to allow for short term interest rate resets  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
during early february  the majority of auction rate securities in the marketplace failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
such failures resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting to predetermined rates within the underlying loan agreement  which might be higher or lower than the current market rate of interest 
in the event we need to access our investments in these types of securities  we will not be able to do so until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the outstanding securities  a buyer is found outside the auction process  or the securities mature  which could be in as much as years 
in the future  should we experience additional auction failures and or determine that these declines in value of auction rate securities are other than temporary  we would recognize a loss in our consolidated statement of operations  which could be material 
in addition  any future failed auctions may adversely impact the liquidity of our investments 
on february   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market s listing qualifications department providing notification that  for the previous consecutive business days  the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market under nasdaq marketplace rule a  referred to as the minimum bid price rule 
nasdaq stated in its notification that  in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule e  we have calendar days  or until august   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
the nasdaq notification also stated that if at any time before august   the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive business days  nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the minimum bid price rule  although nasdaq may  in its discretion  require that we maintain a bid price of in excess of for a period in excess of days  but generally no more than days  before determining that we have demonstrated the ability to maintain long term compliance 
if we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule by august   nasdaq will provide written notification that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
at that time  we may appeal nasdaq s determination to delist our securities to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
alternatively  in the event such delisting is based solely upon non compliance with the minimum bid price rule  we could apply to transfer our securities to the nasdaq capital market  provided that we satisfy the requirements for initial listing on that market set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule c  other than the minimum bid price rule 
if such an application were approved and we otherwise maintain the listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market  other than the minimum bid price requirement  we would be afforded the remainder of the nasdaq capital market s second calendar day grace period in order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than five years operating lease obligation    long term debt   purchase obligations   license milestones total contractual cash obligations   in june and october of  we placed binding purchase orders totaling  with schwarz pharma for production of bidil finished goods during the first quarter of in november  we placed a binding purchase order for  for the purchase of raw materials from flavine international  inc for delivery during the second quarter of on february   we entered into a license agreement with elan  pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay certain milestone payments in the aggregate amount of  of which  has been paid to date 
we are uncertain as to the timing of any future payments  if any  pursuant to the terms of the license agreement and accordingly no amounts are included in the above table 
in january  we ceased actively promoting sales of bidil  which is our only significant source of revenue 
we intend to continue incurring costs related to supporting ongoing prescriptions for bidil  and we also expect to incur additional expenses relating to the ongoing development of bidil xr 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and the cash expected to be generated from future sales of bidil  together with the significant reduction in expenditures as a result of our january restructuring  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  our future capital requirements  and the period in which we expect our current cash to support our operations  may vary from what we expect due to a number of factors  including the following the amount of future product sales of bidil  the cost of manufacturing and selling bidil  the timing of collections related to sales of bidil  the time and costs involved in completing the clinical trials and further development of  and obtaining regulatory approvals for  bidil xr  if at all  our ability to successfully consummate one or more strategic arrangements relating to our business and assets  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  and the cost of maintaining licenses to use patented technologies 
our business plan is to seek to divest all or substantially all of our business through a merger  asset sale  license  business combination or the like 
however  if and for so long as we continue our current business and operations  we will require substantial additional funds  which we expect to generate through a combination of bidil sales and one or more strategic transactions 
we may not be able to successfully consummate a strategic transaction  and additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  whether through a strategic divestiture  financing or borrowing arrangements or other capital raising transaction  we may not be able to support continued prescriptions for bidil  we may be compelled to significantly curtail or delay our development efforts with respect to bidil xr  and we could also be required to limit  scale back or cease our operations  any of which would have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  inventory  accrued expenses and the factors used to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
our principal source of revenue is the sale of bidil  which began shipping in july of other sources of revenue to date include license fees  research and development payments and milestone payments that we have received from our corporate collaborators 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the amount of revenue we can recognize in connection with sales of our products and with respect to our corporate collaborations 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition could change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 
product sales deferred revenue 
we follow the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers or pharmacies when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  wholesaler allowances  rebates  and discounts 
for arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed to wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed 
in addition  we evaluate our level of shipments to wholesalers and pharmacies on a quarterly basis compared to the estimated level of inventory in the channel  remaining shelf life of the product shipped  weekly prescription data and quarterly forecasted sales 
as a result of this evaluation  we deferred million of revenue on shipments in december and recorded this amount in deferred revenue as of december  during  we reversed million of this deferred revenue and recognized the remainder as revenue 
sales returns  allowances  rebates and discounts 
our product sales are subject to returns  wholesaler allowances  rebates and cash and contract discounts that are customary in the pharmaceutical industry 
a large portion of our product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to patients  who are consumers of the product 
we determine the provisions for sales returns  allowances  rebates and discounts based primarily on estimates and contractual terms 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow customers to return product only during the period that is six months prior to  and twelve months after  product expiration 
commercial product shipped during and the first half of had a shelf life of twelve months from date of manufacture with expiration dates ranging from april to may during the third quarter of  we began shipping commercial product with an expiration date of months 
during the second quarter of  we began shipping commercial product with an expiration date of months 
factors that are considered in our estimate of future product returns include an analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channels  discussions with key wholesalers and other customers regarding inventory levels and shipment trends  review of consumer consumption data  and the remaining time to expiration of our product 
as a result of this ongoing evaluation  our product return reserve was million and million at december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a reduction to revenue for product returns of million  million and million  respectively 
the return rate and related reserve are evaluated on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjusted accordingly 
in developing a reasonable estimate for the reserve for product returns  we consider the factors in paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when a right of return exists 
based on the factors noted above  we believe our estimate of product returns is reasonable  and changes  if any  from this estimate would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
during the first quarter of  bidil s shelf life was increased to months and product bottled by our manufacturer in the first quarter of will have a month shelf life 
sample voucher and co pay card program 
beginning in the third quarter of  we initiated a sample voucher program whereby we offered an incentive to patients in the form of a free day trial  or approximately tablets  of bidil 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  or eitf no 
initially  these sample programs had quarterly expiration dates such that each sample voucher program was only active for one quarter at a time 
as a result  at the end of each quarter we could determine the actual amount of reimbursement claims received for the vouchers distributed during the quarter 
the amount of reimbursement is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
during the third quarter  we initiated a six month co pay program whereby we cover the co pay for eligible insured patients for their bidil prescriptions  including refills 
as a result of these programs  we recorded a reduction to revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales discounts  rebates and allowances 
sales discounts  rebates and allowances result primarily from sales under contract with healthcare providers  wholesalers  medicare and medicaid programs and other governmental agencies 
we estimate rebates and contractual allowances  cash and contract discounts and other rebates by considering the following factors current contract prices and terms  sales volume  estimated customer and wholesaler inventory levels and current average rebate rates 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded cash discounts  rebates and other allowances of million  million and million  respectively 
license and collaboration revenue 
we record collaboration revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations  or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services  are deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated performance period 
revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue should be recognized is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the collaborative agreement 
inventory 
we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value could vary significantly from our estimates and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any reporting period 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our current inventory levels and future irrevocable inventory purchase commitments and write down inventory that has become un saleable  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and irrevocable inventory purchase commitments that are in excess of expected future inventory requirements based on our sales forecasts 
for the year ended december   we recorded inventory impairment charges of million to cost of sales related to commercial trade  patient sample inventory and excess raw materials 
for the year ended december   we recorded inventory impairment charges of million to cost of sales related to commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and for contractual purchase commitments in excess of our sales forecast 
for the year ended december   we recorded inventory impairment charges of million to cost of sales related to commercial trade and patient sample inventory  and for contractual purchase commitments in excess of our sales forecast 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include fees such as amounts owed for clinical trials  sales and marketing data management  product development  contract manufacturers for the production of finished goods  marketing and medical support  such as advisory boards  and publications  marketing services and professional services  such as lawyers and accountants 
in connection with such services  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r to recognize compensation cost associated with stock options issued to employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of a stock option 
the fair value of each stock award is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make estimates for volatility  risk free interest rate  expected term  and expected dividend yield 
volatility is determined exclusively using historical volatility data of our common stock based on the period of time since our common stock has been publicly traded 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
the expected life of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the weighted average period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected life is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole  as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population 
accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  sfas and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be over or under stated 
for equity instruments granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services  we estimate the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deem to be relevant at that time 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded prior to the commencement of our public offering on november   market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants include comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we are issuing  pricing of private sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that have occurred between the time of such grants  economic trends  and the comparative rights and preferences of the security being granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors contemporaneously with the grant 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the liquidation preferences  dividend rights  voting control and anti dilution protection attributable to our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock  the status of private and public financial markets  valuations of comparable private and public companies  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering  our existing financial resources  our anticipated continuing operating losses and increased spending levels required to complete our clinical trials  dilution to common stockholders from anticipated future financings and a general assessment of future business risks 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate and us government related securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of two years or less 
in addition  we hold auction rate securities that reset monthly  although the legal maturities of these securities at december  range from to our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  or december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
at march   we held approximately million of investments with an auction reset feature  referred to as auction rate securities 
these auctions have historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
in february  the majority of auction rate securities in the marketplace failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
our ability to liquidate our auction rate securities and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist  and we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
the vast majority of our auction rate securities  including those that have failed  were rated aaa at the time of purchase 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss within the next year  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the credit worthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value
