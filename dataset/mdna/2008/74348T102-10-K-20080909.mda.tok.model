all figures in this item are in thousands except per share and other data the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to the factors discussed under part i  item a risk factors and note about forward looking statements appearing elsewhere herein 
overview we are a financial services company that primarily lends and invests in middle market  privately held companies 
we are a closed end investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of companies in need of capital for acquisitions  divestitures  growth  development  project financing and recapitalization 
we work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows  asset collateral or contracted pro forma cash flows 
the aggregate value of our portfolio investments was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   our net cost of investments increased by  or  as we invested in new and follow on investments while we sold three investments and we received repayment on five other investments 
compared to the end of last fiscal year ended june   net assets increased by  during the year ended june   from  to  this increase resulted from the issuance of new shares of our common stock less offering costs in the amount of  dividend reinvestments of  and another  from operations 
these increases  in turn  were offset by  in dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the  increase in net assets resulting from operations is net of the following net investment income of  realized loss on investments of  and a net decrease in net assets due to changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments of  the realized losses were mainly due to the sale of central illinois energy  llc  or cie  and advantage oilfield group ltd  or aog 
the net unrealized depreciation was driven by significant write downs in our investments in  integrated contract services  inc  or ics  worcester energy partners  inc  or wepi  and our coal holdings whymore  genesis  north folk and unity now consolidated into yatesville  which  in turn  were almost offset by write ups for our investments in gshi  and by the disposition of previously written down investments in aog and in esa environmental specialists  or esa 
we seek to be a long term investor with our investment companies 
to date we have invested primarily in industries related to the industrial energy economy 
however  we continue to widen our strategy focus in other sectors of the economy to diversify our portfolio holdings 
after a robust global debt market during the earlier part of  beginning in june  signs of strain emerged as fears of increasing defaults in the subprime mortgage lending market caused a broader loss of investor confidence beyond the subprime mortgage lending market and into the corporate leveraged loan and high yield debt markets 
collateralized loan obligations  or clos  and hedge funds  in particular  have been a driving force in the excess liquidity that existed in the debt capital markets 
the loss of investor confidence in many of these highly leveraged investment vehicles has significantly constrained the market for new clo issuances  a consequence of limited relevance to our business historically 
since june  there has been a significant reduction in liquidity in the corporate debt capital markets and transactions in the high yield and leveraged loan markets have recently been cancelled  postponed  or restructured  enhancing opportunities for us going forward 
the extra supply and meaningfully less demand has shifted the dynamics between buyers and sellers and caused several hundred billion dollars of corporate loans and bridge loan commitments to remain on the balance sheets of financial institutions and remain undistributed 
we believe that  as of today  this reduction in liquidity has caused increased market volatility in the secondary prices of existing leveraged loans and high yield bonds  driving many leveraged loan and bond market quotes to below the primary market offer price without necessarily reflecting a deterioration  if any  in underlying fundamental performance of many of these issuers 
if we were to enter into these markets in a meaningful way  we would be able to lend money at higher rates of interest and would be able to purchase loans at greater discounts than prior to the occurrence of these events 
we also expect that greater structural protection that lenders require for new loans  such as lower overall financial leverage and maintenance financial covenants  will increase the opportunities for us to invest since we have generally decided not to invest in highly leveraged or covenant light credit facilities 
in turn  these events also could increase our cost or availability of financing 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ

significant accounting policies and estimates we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies  and they are consistently applied by us 
consolidation under the act rules  the regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x  and the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide for investment companies  we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services and benefits to us 
our june  financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of prospect capital funding  llc  our only wholly owned  closely managed subsidiary that is also an investment company 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments a security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis 
b valuation investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
short term investments that mature in days or less  such as united states treasury bills  are valued at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
the amortized cost method involves recording a security at its cost ie  principal amount plus any premium and less any discount on the date of purchase and thereafter amortizing accreting that difference between the principal amount due at maturity and cost assuming a constant yield to maturity as determined at the time of purchase 
short term securities that mature in more than days are valued at current market quotations by an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
investments in money market mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation 
it is expected that most of the investments in our portfolio will not have actively traded markets 
debt and equity securities which do not have actively traded markets are valued with the assistance of an independent valuation service using a documented valuation policy and a valuation process that is consistently applied under the direction of our board of directors 
the factors that may be taken into account in valuing such investments include  as relevant  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its estimated earnings and projected discounted cash flows  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the sensitivity of the investments to fluctuations in interest rates  the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates  comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies  and changes in interest rates for similar debt instruments  and other relevant factors 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that are not actively traded  the fair value of these investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an actively traded market existed for such investments  and any such differences could be material 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a new pronouncement addressing fair value measurements  statement of financial accounting standards number  fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after november   therefore  its first applicability to the company will be for the company s upcoming fiscal year beginning july  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will materially impact the amounts reported in our financial statements  however  additional disclosures will be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements reported to changes in net assets for a fiscal period 
in february  fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and  therefore  is applicable for our upcoming fiscal year beginning july  our management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas is intended to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why the entity uses derivatives  how derivatives are accounted for  and how derivatives affect an entity s results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
sfas becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and  therefore  is applicable for our fiscal year beginning july  our management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with us gaap 
this statement is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
our management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements

federal and state income taxes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code of the code  applicable to regulated investment companies 
we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute or retain through a deemed distribution all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders  therefore  we have made no provision for income taxes

book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid in capital 
if we do not distribute or we are deemed not to have distributed at least of its annual taxable income in the year earned  the company will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by which of the company s annual taxable income exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for the year 
to the extent that the company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income  the company accrues excise taxes  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate 
the annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income 
we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented  and disclosed in the financial statements 
fin requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year 
adoption of fin was applied to all open tax years as of july  the adoption of fin did not have an effect on our net asset value  financial condition or results of operations as there was no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no change to our beginning net asset value 
as of june  and for the year then ended  we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits 
management s determinations regarding fin may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including  but not limited to  an on going analysis of tax laws  regulations and interpretations thereof

fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  for those guarantees that are covered by fin  the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees

investment holdings in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june   the audit committee considered valuations from the independent valuation firm and from management having an aggregate range of  to  as of june   we continue to pursue our investment strategy 
despite our name change to prospect capital corporation and the termination of our policy to invest at least of our net assets in energy companies  we currently have a concentration of investments in companies in the energy and energy related industries 
some of the companies in which we invest have relatively short or no operating histories 
these companies are and will be subject to all of the business risk and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise  including the risk that these companies may not reach their investment objective or the value of our investment in them may decline substantially or fall to zero

as defined in the act  control investments are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company 
control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within days or less  a beneficial ownership of or more of the voting securities of an investee company 
affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within days or less  beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person 
as of june   we own controlling interests in ajax  c j cladding  llc  or c j  gshi  ics  iron horse coiled tubing  inc  or iron horse  nrg  r v industries  inc  or r v  wepi  and yatesville 
we also own an affiliated interest in appalachian energy holdings  llc  or aeh 
the following is a summary of our investment portfolio by level of control june  june  level of control fair value percent of portfolio fair value percent of portfolio control   affiliate   non control non affiliate   money market funds   total portfolio   investment valuation during the fiscal year ended june   several general economic factors have occurred which have affected the valuation of our investment portfolio 
generally  interest rates offered on loans similar to those that we have originated have changed since our investments were consummated 
while we do not believe that there has been any diminution of credit quality  general changes in current interest rates would affect the price for which we could sell these assets and we have adjusted our fair value of these assets to reflect such changes 
we have adjusted the value of nine debt investments based upon such general changes in market interest rates including aeh  c j cladding llc  deb shops  diamondback  jettco marine services llc  qualitest  regional management corp  shearer s  and stryker energy  llc 
three debt investments were made to companies that are not performing in line with budget expectations 
these investments conquest cherokee  llc  iron horse  and wind river are well collateralized and we expect full recovery 
for these assets  we have increased the market interest rates to take into account the increased credit risk and general changes in current interest rates for similar assets to determine their fair value 
control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments 
operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter 
significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment 
several control assets in our portfolio are under enhanced scrutiny by our senior management and our board of directors and are discussed below 
gas solutions holdings  inc gshi is an investment that we made in september and own of the equity 
gshi is a midstream gathering and processing business located in east texas 
gshi has improved its operations and we have experienced an increase in revenue  gross margin  and ebitda the later two metrics on both an absolute and a percentage of revenues basis over the past four years 
in late december  we engaged rbc capital markets corporation as a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives  including a potential sale 
this monetization process is ongoing  and discussions are occurring with interested parties 
the interested parties have expressed interest in acquiring the assets of gshi but progress towards a closing has been slow due to the turmoil in the credit markets for financing such assets 
a sale of the assets  rather than the stock of gshi  might result in a significant tax liability at the gshi level which will need to be paid prior to any distribution to us 
in late march  royal bank of canada provided a million term loan to gas solutions ii ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of gshi  the proceeds of which were used to refinance all of citibank s approximately million of outstanding senior secured debt as well as to make a million cash distribution to gshi 
we have non recourse access to this cash at gshi 
in early may  gas solutions ii ltd purchased a series of propane puts at out of the money and at prices of per gallon and per gallon covering the periods may   through april   and may   through april   respectively 
these hedges have been executed at close to the highest market propane prices ever achieved on an historical basis  such hedges preserve the upside of gas solutions ii ltd to benefit from potential future increases in commodity prices 
gshi has generated approximately million of unadjusted plant operating income based on annualizing the performance of the six months ending june   which is an increase of from fiscal year end for calendar year  gshi estimates based on current commodity prices that it would achieve more than million of unadjusted plant operating income 
in determining the value of gshi  we have utilized three methods to derive the enterprise value the market approach  income approach  and the indicative value from several letters of interest 
these methods offer a wide range of values and our board of directors has determined the value to be  after tax for our debt and equity positions at june  gshi has been valued at  above its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized gain recorded at june  integrated contract services  inc our investment in integrated contract services  inc  or ics  is under enhanced review by our senior management team due to existing or potential payment and or covenant defaults under the contracts governing these investments 
ics owns the assets of esa environmental specialists  inc  or esa  and of the stock of the healing staff  or ths 
esa originally defaulted under our contract governing our investment in esa  prompting us to commence foreclosure actions with respect to certain esa assets in respect of which we have a priority lien 
in response to our actions  esa filed voluntarily for reorganization under the bankruptcy code on august  on september  the us bankruptcy court approved a section asset sale from esa to us 
to complete this transaction  we contributed our esa debt to a newly formed entity  ics  and provided funds for working capital on october  in return for the esa debt  we received senior secured debt in ics of equal amount to our esa debt  preferred stock of ics  and of the ics common stock 
ics subsequently ceased operations and assigned the collateral back to us 
ics is in default of both payment and financial covenants 
during september and october  we provided  to ths for working capital 
we have a senior secured  first lien debt position with collateral in the form of receivables  real estate  other assets  guaranties  and the stock of ths 
based upon an analysis of the liquidation value of the esa assets and the enterprise value of ths  our board of directors reduced the fair value of our investment in ics to  a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized loss recorded at june  r v industries  inc r v demonstrated strong performance in operations throughout with trailing twelve month ebitda increasing by over since our closing in may r v continues to pay down debt  repaying  of our debt during the fiscal year ended june  our board of directors  upon recommendation from senior management  has set the value of the r v investment at  at june    above its amortized cost  compared to valuing the rv investment at par at june  worcester energy partners  inc wepi is under enhanced review by our senior management team due to poor operating results since investment

during the year ended june   we experienced unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per share primarily from the sales of our investments in advantage oilfield group and central illinois energy at a loss 
while we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses  our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate as these companies are typically not issuing securities rated investment grade  have limited resources  have limited operating history  are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents 
changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company 
investment income we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own  dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own  and amortized loan origination fees on the structuring of new deals 
our investments  if in the form of debt securities  will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
to the extent achievable  we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies assets 
we also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies  which may pay cash or in kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis 
in addition  we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned 
investment income  which consists of interest income  including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees  dividend income and other income  including net profits interest  overriding royalties interest and structuring fees  was   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively

average interest income producing assets have increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  while we have been able to increase the gross amount of interest income  average yields on interest bearing assets have decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  these decreases are the result of our increasing our asset mix in financings with private equity sponsors 
we believe that such financings offer less risk  and consequently lower yields  due  in part  to lesser risk to our capital resulting from larger equity at risk underneath our capital 
holding these types of investments has allowed us to more effectively utilize our credit facility to finance such assets at an average rate of for the year ended june  investment income is also generated from dividends and other income 
dividend income has grown significantly from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  we have received dividends from our investments in gshi  r v  ajax  c j and nrg

these increases are directly related to our growth in total assets 
  and  income incentive fees were earned for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively

over the last year  prospect administration has added several additional staff members  including a senior finance professional  a treasurer  a corporate counsel and other finance professionals 
as our portfolio continues to grow  we expect to continue to increase the size of our administrative and financial staff on a basis that provides increasing returns to scale 
however  initial investments in administrative and financial staff may not provide returns to scale immediately  perhaps not until the portfolio increases to a greater size 
other allocated expenses from prospect administration have  as expected  increased alongside with the increase in staffing and asset base

while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the twelve months ended june   we did not engage in hedging activities
