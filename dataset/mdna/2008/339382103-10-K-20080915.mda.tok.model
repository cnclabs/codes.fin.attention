item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all of the financial information presented in this item has been revised to reflect the impact of the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements  which is more fully described in note  error corrections of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the cumulative impact of the unreconciled accounts payable was an increase to accounts payable of million  an increase to deferred income taxes current of million and a reduction to shareholder s equity of million  as of july  general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectibility of trade accounts receivable  inventory valuation  depreciable lives  self insurance programs  warranty costs and income taxes 
ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable fair value due to their short term nature 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience and actual returns and allowances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
a large portion of our finished goods inventory is made to order and many of our raw material parts are interchangeable between products 
historically inventory write downs to market have been in fabric  wood frame and trim  and sourced products purchased for inventory 
management assesses the inventory on hand versus estimated future usage and estimated selling prices and if necessary writes down the obsolete or excess inventory to market 
although  we believe that inventory valuations are reasonable  unexpected changes in sales volume due to economic or competitive conditions may impact inventory valuations 
raw steel  lumber and wood frame parts are valued on the last in  first out lifo method 
other inventories are valued on the first in  first out fifo method 
changes in the market conditions could require a write down of inventory 
self insurance programs the company is self insured for health care and most workers compensation up to predetermined amounts above which third party insurance applies 
the company purchases specific stop loss insurance for individual health care claims in excess of  per plan year  with a million individual lifetime maximum 
for workers compensation the company retains the first  per claim and purchases excess coverage up to the statutory limits for amounts in excess of the retention limit 
the company is contingently liable to insurance carriers under its comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability policies  as well as some workers compensation 
losses are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability of claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
the actual claims experience could differ from the estimates made by the company based on actual experience 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the company s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions including a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  was  reflecting lower net income compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year significant working capital changes from june  to june  included decreased accounts receivables of million  increased inventory levels of million and decreased accounts payable of million 
the decrease in receivables is related to timing of shipments and related payment terms  collection efforts and lower net sales 
the increase in inventory is due primarily to timing of inventory purchases to meet our forecasted customer demands especially sourced products where there are longer lead times for international shipments 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to the timing of payments 
the company expects that due to the nature of our operations that there will continue to be significant fluctuations in inventory levels  the related accounts payable  and cash flows from operations due to the following we purchase a significant amount of inventory in large orders from overseas suppliers with significant lead times and depending on the timing of those large orders inventory levels can be significantly impacted  we have various large customers that purchase significant quantities of inventory at a time and the timing of those purchases can significantly impact inventory levels  accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term borrowings 
as discussed below the company believes it has adequate financing arrangements and access to capital to absorb these fluctuations in operating cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the significant change in investing activities is related to the large amount of capital expenditures made in somewhat offset by a sale of land and commercial property 
capital expenditures were million  million and million of which million was a non cash purchase of equipment by assumption of a note payable in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal expenditures were primarily for manufacturing equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the company expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal year the significant fiscal year capital expenditure cash outflows were offset by a significant sale of commercial property resulting in total cash proceeds of million and a sale of vacant land of approximately million 
the commercial property was previously leased to a non related third party and used as retail space 
neither the sale of the commercial property or vacant land is expected to significantly impact future operations 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year for fiscal years and  repayment of debt and the payment of dividends were the primary financing activities utilizing cash 
for fiscal year  borrowings were used to pay for the expansion of inventory programs and accounts receivable and the payment of dividends 
cash dividends were million in and in management believes that the company has adequate cash  cash equivalents  and credit arrangements to meet its operating and capital requirements for fiscal year in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity and credit resources provide it with the ability to react to opportunities as they arise  the ability to pay quarterly dividends to its shareholders  and ensures that productive capital assets that enhance safety and improve operations are purchased as needed 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at june  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flow in the future in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations contractual obligations associated with the company s deferred compensation plans were excluded from the table above as the company cannot predict when the events that trigger payment will occur 
total accumulated deferred compensation liabilities were million at june  at june  the company had no capital lease obligations  and no purchase obligations for raw materials or finished goods 
the purchase price on all open purchase orders was fixed and denominated in us dollars 
additionally  the company has excluded the fin reserve from the above table as the timing of any payments cannot be reasonably estimated 
financing arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
outlook the fiscal year ended june  began well with the first two quarters showing improved earnings over fiscal year on only slightly lower net sales 
beginning in the third fiscal quarter net sales dropped more rapidly  and although net earnings were only about of the prior year quarterly amount  our net income for the nine months was still ahead of the prior year nine month total 
the fourth quarter decrease in net sales hampered the ability to absorb fixed costs and that  combined with additional bad debt and selling expenses  contributed negatively to fiscal year results 
normally  at least one of the markets in which we sell products is doing well 
however  residential net sales were off  commercial net sales were down  and recreational vehicle seating net sales were down 
we do not believe that we are losing market share in these categories 
the us economy  where most of our products are sold  has been greatly impacted by the credit crisis in the home mortgage sector  a fall in the value of the us dollar versus most other major currencies  volatile high cost fuel  increasing food prices and a changing political landscape 
these factors have contributed to the lowest consumer confidence levels since we have been negatively impacted by price increases in the raw materials and component parts  such as steel  poly foam and fabrics  as well as increases in the cost to transport those materials to our manufacturing facilities and products to our customers 
our overseas manufacturers have also increased prices and the cost to transport those products to the us has increased with the price of fuel 
we see no near term improvement in macro economic operating conditions 
this year flexsteel industries  inc will complete it s th year doing business in the furniture industry 
while we have seen challenging business conditions before  they are never comfortable or reassuring to our shareholders 
in response to these challenges  we have implemented price increases to offset cost increases where possible  commenced the closing of two manufacturing operations  lancaster  pa and new paris  in  to more closely match our manufacturing capacity with our expected demand for residential and recreational vehicle seating products and we anticipate annual pre tax savings in the range of million to million from this manufacturing consolidation  focused attention on our credit risk exposure  maintained a close relationship with our customers to offer products and services they need to operate effectively and profitability  and continued to focus on profitability and cash flow over top line growth to maintain a strong balance sheet 
while we expect that current business conditions will persist for most  if not all  of fiscal year  we remain optimistic that our strategy of a wide range of quality product offerings and price points to the residential  recreational vehicle and commercial markets combined with our conservative approach to business will be rewarded over the longer term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
impairment of long lived assets accounting rules require that long lived assets be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have substantial long lived assets  consisting mainly of property  plant and equipment  which based upon such events or changes in circumstances  there could be a write down of all or a portion of these assets and a corresponding reduction in our earnings and net worth 
at june   no impairment of long lived assets has been identified 
foreign currency risk during fiscal years  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming no change in the volume or composition of debt 
as of june   the company has effectively fixed the interest rates at on approximately million of its long term debt through the use of interest rate swaps  and the above estimated earnings reduction takes these swaps into account 
on july   a million swap matured 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  the company has effectively fixed its interest rate at on approximately million of it long term debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
as of june   the fair value of these swaps is a liability of approximately million and is included in other liabilities 
as of june   the fair value of these swaps were an asset of approximately million and was included in other assets 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant during the past three years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates are important components of costs for the company 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact any or all of these components  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  the company has faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments
