backlog at march   our backlog consisted of approximately million of ship repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at april  and april   respectively 
our backlog is primarily attributable to firm fixed price repair  and maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year the decrease in backlog is due primarily to the timing of u 
s government jobs 
availability of materials the principal materials we use in our shipyard are steel and aluminum plates and shapes  pipe and fittings  paint and electrical cable and associated fittings 
management believes that each of these items can presently be obtained in the domestic market from a number of different suppliers 
in addition  we maintain a small on site inventory of various materials that are available for emergency ship repairs 
employees the number of persons we employ varies considerably and depends primarily on the level of shipyard activity 
employment averaged approximately during fiscal year and totaled approximately employees on march  during fiscal year  an average of approximately of our shipyard employees were covered by a union contract that became effective on august  at march   approximately employees were covered under this contract 
in november  todd pacific shipyards reached an agreement for a new collective bargaining agreement with the puget sound metal trades council the bargaining umbrella for all unions at todd pacific shipyards which was subsequently ratified by the rank and file members 
the three year agreement  which was retroactive to august   will expire on july  the agreement provides for increases in the wages and fringe benefits at a rate of approximately per year 
we consider our relations with the various unions to be stable 
acquisition of assets of everett shipyard  inc 
on march   our subsidiary everett ship repair drydock  inc everett acquired the assets of everett shipyard  inc esy 
esy performed ship repair work for a range of government and commercial customers  including the united states navy and washington state ferries  at two locations in everett  washington 
everett will continue esy s shipyard operations 
everett named kevin quigley as its president and he will be responsible for the operation of the shipyard 
mr 
quigley had served as president of esy for the past seven years 
the assets acquired by everett include esy s interest in a  ton dry dock which was recently added to esy s operations  allowing everett to compete in a broader market of marine repair and overhaul opportunities 
esy and our seattle shipyard do not generally compete for the same contracts 
everett has assumed the collective bargaining agreements with the international brotherhood of boilermakers  local and the united brotherhood of carpenters  local the new yard intends to employ the workforce previously employed by esy 
regulatory matters environmental and bodily injusty matters we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these laws 
we have an accrued liability of million as of march  for environmental and bodily injury matters 
as assessments of environmental matters and remediation activities progress  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical  engineering and legal information that becomes available 
our estimate of environmental liabilities is affected by several uncertainties such as  but not limited to  the method and extent of remediation of contaminated sites  the percentage of material attributable to us at the sites relative to that attributable to other parties  and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties prp at most sites 
our estimate of bodily injury liabilities is also affected as additional information becomes known regarding alleged damages from past exposure to asbestos at our facilities 
we are covered under various insurance policies for some  but not all  potential environmental and bodily injury l iabilities 
as of march   we recorded an insurance receivable of million  which mitigates a major portion of the accrued environmental and bodily injury liabilities 
for further information regarding our environmental and bodily injury matters see item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
safety matters we are also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act osha and similar state statutes 
we have an extensive health and safety program and employ a staff of safety fire inspectors whose primary functions are to monitor in process work to assure safety protocols are being followed 
secondarily  our safety fire inspectors staff develop company policies that meet or exceed the safety standards set by osha  train production supervisors to our policies and make periodic inspections of safety procedures to insure compliance with our policies on safety and industrial hygiene 
all production employees are required to attend regularly scheduled safety training meetings 
item a 
risk factors set forth below are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise adversely affect our business 
economic downturns and reductions in government funding could have a negative impact on our business 
significant portions of our revenues are derived from contracts that are funded by the government 
our ability to obtain future government work at reasonable margins is highly dependent on the amount of work that is available to bid  which is largely a function of the level of government funding available 
the availability of government funding also affects the long term contracts we currently have as the contacts are based on options that the government could choose not to exercise if funding is cut back or not available at all 
the availability of funding could also affect whether or not those long term government contracts are renewed 
we also perform commercial work for customers in the private sector 
the availability of this private sector work can be significantly adversely affected by general economic downturns and by fluctuations in specific customers economic circumstan ces 
our cost type government contracts provide the government with the option to have us perform repair  maintenance and overhaul activities on certain government ships  and in some cases at certain government facilities 
while work on these ships is typically done at reasonably predictable intervals  those intervals can be substantially altered as a result of changing military priorities and other unexpected deployments 
furthermore  a decision by the government to redeploy these ships to another permanent geographic location could have a negative impact on our business depending on that location 
additionally  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to win renewal of any of cost type government contracts 
even in the absence of geographic reassignment or other necessity  the government remains free to elect to have work done by other parties that is contemplated to be done under their contracts with us 
our fixed price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost 
the profitability of fixed price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of the original bid 
even in situations in which some of such increased costs arise as a result of customer initiated or approved change orders  there may be a delay or dispute as to the amount of increased revenue due to us 
our accounting for revenues and costs involves significant estimates 
as further described in critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation item  accounting for contract related revenues and costs as well as other cost items requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reliable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of operations 
on a regular basis  we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and a llocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the government has the ability to recover or disallow any costs which are improperly charged against or allocated to the contracts 
our future profitability depends largely on the ability of the shipyard to maintain an adequate volume of ship repair  overhaul and conversion business to augment our longer term contracts 
the variables affecting our business volume include public support provided to competing northwest shipyards  excess west coast and industry wide shipyard capacity  domestic and foreign competition  governmental legislation and regulatory issues  activity levels of the navy and other customers  competitors pricing behavior  and our labor efficiencies  work practices and estimating abilities 
other factors that can contribute to future profitability include the amounts of annual expenditures needed to ensure continuing serviceability of our owned and leased machinery and equipment 
our long term success in managing a profitable operation at our newly acquired shipyard in everett  washington will depend on the availability of a sufficient volume of profitable work including pier side washington state ferry repairs and continued work on small barges for the united states navy both pier side and in drydock 
weather conditions can significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
our ability to perform work can be significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
additionally  delays and other weather impacts may increase a project s cost and decrease profitability 
our long term success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment 
an important factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is also our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel 
our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the personnel resources available in our geographic area and general economic conditions  as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and desirable work environment 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace 
as more fully described under competition above  we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for projects  competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in our ability to be competitive at acceptable margins 
as more fully described under regulatory matters above  we are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment and workplace safety  the noncompliance with which can result in substantial penalties as well as civil and criminal liability 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect operations in the future 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at our seattle shipyard and at closed former facilities 
we are currently defending approximately such claims  of which are considered significant 
we have insurance agreements in place to cover these potential liabilities but a portion of that coverage  based on historical data  is expected to be exhausted in approximately three years 
the continued defense and settlement of these claims  after exhaustion of one of the insuring agreements  could have a significant impact on our profitability 
strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on operations and results 
we are party to a collective bargaining agreement covering a substantial portion of our craft workforce 
that agreement expires on july  although our results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the recent past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on operations and results if they were to occur in the future 
we use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
petroleum based products are used to fuel and lubricate our equipment 
steel and other commodities are used in projects and they can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
we have not been significantly adversely affected by commodity price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that it will not be in the future 
failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results 
we subcontract portions of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors but we remain ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although we attempt to obtain bonding or other forms of guarantees  we are not always successful in obtaining bonds or guarantees from certain subcontractors 
accordingly  there is no guarantee that we will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues 
as more fully described in item  legal proceedings  we have various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage of the costs to remediate environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury cases 
these policies are primarily with two insurance companies 
management believes based on the current credit ratings of both of these companies and other insurance coverage that we maintain  our insurance coverage will be adequate to meet the obligations reflected 
however  if this assumption is incorrect and either or both of these companies are unable to meet their future financial commitments and our secondary coverage is inadequate  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial  also may impact us unfavorably 
should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  we caution the reader not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

item properties the acre shipyard facility in seattle offers three operating dry docks 
five piers offer a total of nearly  feet of berthing space 
the design capacities of our three operating dry docks located at the shipyard are as follows 
pgddproperties 
gif 
on december  we announced that we were awarded a five year lease with the navy for the use of the afdm dry dock  resolute dry dock 
the resolute arrived at the shipyard on august  where it was placed into service on january  the resolute is feet long  feet wide  has a design capacity of  tons and is be used to dock a variety of commercial and government ships 
the lease terms on dry dock and dry dock provide for nominal annual lease payments and minimum amounts of annual maintenance that we must perform 
the leases also include minimum levels of maintenance that we must perform over the life of the lease 
we have included the nominal annual lease payments and the costs of the average annual maintenance that must be performed over the life of the leases on these dry docks in the current and future lease commitments in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item we are currently in negotiations to purchase the yfd dry dock from the navy  meanwhile the rental continues on a month to month basis 
our third and only owned floating dry dock  the emerald sea  ceased commercial operation on may  and  along with certain other facilities under a lease arrangement  was utilized by kiewit general through july for the construction of bridge anchors for the new eastern section of the hood canal bridge in kitsap county  washington 
for purposes of the kiewit general lease  the dock was cut into two sections 
five of the eight pontoons that comprise the dry dock were placed back into service subsequent to the lease with kiewit general and are currently used in our barge repair and refurbishment business 
the remaining three pontoon section is not currently in service 
we believe that our owned and leased properties at the shipyard are in reasonable operating condition given their age and usage  although from time to time we are required to incur substantial expenditures to ensure the continuing serviceability of certain owned and leased machinery and equipment 
we removed a segment of pier as part of the remedial action on the harbor island superfund site see below and determined that replacement of that pier segment is not necessary for the continued operation of the shipyard 
several older piers have a continued life expectancy of approximately fifteen years 
we will make a decision regarding the replacement of those piers at a time closer to the end of the affected piers useful lives 
on march   our subsidiary everett ship repair drydock  inc everett acquired the assets of everett shipyard  inc esy  including esy s interest in a  ton dry dock which was recently added to esy s operations  allowing everett to compete in a broader market of marine repair and overhaul opportunities 
during fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on shipyard capital expenditures 
item legal proceedings we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these laws 
such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for our acts  which are or were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
we face potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at our seattle shipyard  our former closed shipyard sites  and at several sites we used for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
we are identified as a prp by the environmental protection agency epa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund in connection with matters pending at three superfund sites 
additionally  we received information requests in several superfund cases where we asserted that our liability was discharged when we emerged from bankruptcy in additionally  we have been named in a contribution action under cercla and the washington state model toxics control act mtca by a local port authority 
generally  these environmental claims relate to sites we used for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
we are also named as a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former facilities 
at march   we maintained aggregate reserves of million for pending claims and assessments relating to environmental and bodily injury matters  including million associated with the harbor island superfund site the harbor island site and million for asbestos related claims 
funding for costs and payments of claims represented by such reserves is expected to be recovered significantly by receivables due from insurance companies under policies and insurance in place agreements described below 
at march   such receivables aggregated million 
included in the reserves are estimated final sediment remediation costs for harbor island of million that are expected to occur within the next years after certain piers reach the end of their useful lives 
these costs are reflected in our balance sheet under environmental and other reserves 
similarly  the insurance receivable of million relating to these reserves is reflected in our balance sheet under insurance receivable 
for more information  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item below and the discussion under the heading environmental matters and contingencies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item below 
harbor island site we  along with several other parties  have been named as prps by the epa pursuant to cercla also known as superfund in connection with the documented release or threatened release of hazardous substances  pollutants and contaminants at the harbor island superfund site the harbor island site  upon which the shipyard is located 
harbor island site insurance in fiscal year  we entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that provides us with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of all our operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount greater than our current booked reserves of million 
additionally  we entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
harbor island site history to date  the epa has separated the harbor island site into three operable units that affect us the soil and groundwater unit the soil unit  the shipyard sediments operable unit the ssou and the sediments operable unit the sou 
we  along with a number of other harbor island prps  received a special notice letter from the epa on may  pursuant to section e of cercla 
we entered into a consent decree for the soil unit in september under which we agreed to remediate the designated contamination on our property 
removal of floating petroleum product from the water table began in october and is anticipated to continue through fiscal year during fiscal year  the epa issued its record of decision rod for the ssou 
the rod identifies four alternative solutions for the ssou remediation and identifies the epa s selected remedy 
during fiscal year  the epa expanded the boundaries of the ssou issuing their phase b data report and resulting explanation of significant differences outlining the changes to the rod 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an administrative order of consent with the epa for the development of the remedial design for the ssou 
during fiscal year  we entered into a consent decree with the epa for the cleanup of the ssou  which  along with the associated remedial design statement of work for remedial action sow  was subsequently approved by the department of justice 
the consent decree provides for the submittal of the remedial action work plan to the epa subsequent to the approval by the epa of the final design 
the remedial action work plan provides for construction and implementation of the remedy set forth in the rod  the two explanation of significant differences issued in fiscal years and  the sow  and the design plans and specifications developed in accordance with the remedial action work plan and approved by the epa 
during fiscal year we submitted our final design report to the epa for the ssou 
the final design report provides for the following actions to take place at the ssou the demolition and removal of piers and south located on the duwamish waterway will achieve more complete cleanup in those areas 
dredging of all contaminated sediments and shipyard waste in the open areas of the ssou surrounding the shipyard and in the areas beneath piers and south 
the total estimated volume of sediments to be removed is  cubic yards 
disposal of all recovered sediment and shipyard waste at an appropriate upland disposal facility 
backfilling of portions of the areas dredged to create inter tidal habitat where feasible 
capping of areas beneath the piers that are not scheduled for demolition to an average thickness of one foot 
pursuant to the schedule  remediation of the ssou began in fiscal year environmental regulations limit the period of time during the year that dredging may occur 
given these limits  dredging in the ssou required several years to accomplish 
we completed our first year of dredging during fiscal year and the second and final year of dredging during fiscal year as part of the sediment remedial action on our property  a temporary sand cap was placed over the sediments that are beneath piers  and p  and the building berth adjacent to pier at such time that those piers reach the end of their usable lives estimated to occur within the next years  we are obligated to demolish those piers and conduct final cleanup of the under pier sediments 
the cost of these final sediment superfund remedial actions on our property is included in the stated reserve 
during january  the epa notified us that testing would be required in the west waterway of the duwamish river outside the borders of the ssou as part of the sou 
during may  we entered into an administrative order on consent to perform certain limited testing as part of the sou investigation 
after an evaluation of the results  the epa issued a draft no action rod on the sou for public comment which if issued in final form would end the investigation of the sou  requiring no remedial action 
the public comment period closed during fiscal year in september  the epa issued the final no action rod on the sou 
we have not established a reserve for any remediation on the sou 
under the federal superfund law  potentially responsible parties may have liability for damages to natural resources in addition to liability for remediation 
during fiscal year  we began discussions with the natural resource trustees trustees for the harbor island superfund site site and continued these discussions during the remainder of fiscal year we anticipate that the trustees will file a claim against us at some future date alleging damages to the natural resources at the site caused by the release of hazardous substances 
the best estimate of a potential natural resource damage claim has been included in the environmental reserve 
the payment of any eventual claim is covered by the aforementioned insurance policy  except for the policy deductible  provided that aggregate policy limits have not been exceeded 
the amount of the policy deductible payment is reflected in our environmental reserve at march  and april   respectively 
other environmental remediation matters the port of tacoma  washington filed a civil action against us during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the united states district court western district of washington in tacoma for contribution under cercla and mtca 
we previously disclosed our involvement with the cercla remediation efforts in the hylebos waterway of commencement bay in tacoma  washington and subsequent natural resources assessment by the statutorily named trustees trustees 
a former subsidiary of ours operated a shipbuilding operation on the hylebos waterway under contract to the united states navy during world war ii 
the contract between our subsidiary and the navy for the operation of the shipyard site included an indemnification clause flowing from the united states to our subsidiary 
we have tendered any potential liability to the united states pursuant to this contract 
the united states has not responded to the tender 
we have not had a presence at the site since we have further taken the position with the epa and the trustees that any potential liability that we may have had for the site was discharged in our filing under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the epa did not name us as a potentially responsible party nor have the trustees filed a claim against us for natural resource damages 
the trustees filed a claim against the united states for natural resources damages caused by the government 
the trustees and the united states have entered into a consent decree resolving the claim  releasing the united states from further liability in connection with the site 
we appeared at the consent decree hearing in united states district court in tacoma  washington in october to protect our indemnification agreement with the united states 
the judge approved entry of the consent decree but also ruled that the consent decree would not operate to relieve the united states from any contractual indemnification obligations it may owe us 
we are una ble to estimate our potential exposure for this item 
we have included our current best estimate of this potential liability in our environmental reserve and will continue to analyze this exposure as we begin discovery in the recently filed litigation 
we entered into a consent decree with the epa for the clean up of the casmalia resources hazardous waste management facility in santa barbara county  california under the resource conservation and recovery act 
we included an estimate of the potential liability for this site in our environmental reserve 
during fiscal year  the epa notified us that we are a potentially responsible party prp at the malone service company superfund site malone in galveston county  texas 
the epa alleges that our galveston shipyard  which ceased operations in  was the generator of waste materials that were delivered  through independent transport companies  to the malone site 
the epa has further indicated that we will  based on volumes of material at the site that we generated  be eligible to participate in a de minimus settlement for small contributors 
we have included our best estimate of the settlement amount in our environmental reserve 
during fiscal year  we received notification that we  along with other companies and organizations  are a potentially responsible party at the bkk landfill facility in west covina  california 
the site is the subject of an investigation and remedial order from the california department of toxic substances control 
it is alleged that our san pedro shipyard closed in caused shipyard waste to be sent to the bkk facility during the s and s 
due to the uncertainties at this time we have not established a reserve for this issue 
we received notification in november regarding the discovery of sub surface oil on the property we formerly owned in galveston  texas 
we sold the property to the port of galveston in and there have been several intervening owners and operators at the site since we are investigating the factual allegations and any potential liability 
due to the uncertainties at this time we have not established a reserve for this issue 
asbestos related claims and insurance we are named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at our seattle shipyard and closed former facilities 
in addition to us  the cases generally include other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers as defendants  and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
we assess claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  we categorize certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis as malignant claims 
we categorize all other claims of a less medically serious nature as non malignant 
we are currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of march  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against us 
considering known facts  the previously stated claimants is our best estimate 
approximately cases do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately cases assert on behalf of each claimant a claim for compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases seek compensatory damages of less than million per claim 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants made which claims or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  we have not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
our insurers and we are vigorously defending these actions 
bodily injury reserves declined from million at april  to million at march  bodily injury insurance receivables also decreased from million at april  to million at march  we classified these bodily injury liabilities and receivables within our consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
we entered into agreements with several of our insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after we utilize contractual formulas to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgment of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result and as further discussed below  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  we project that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at april   we projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
we resolved malignant cl aims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  our costs related to subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements may increase 
the following chart indicates the number of claims filed and resolved in the past two fiscal years  including the number of claims yet to be resolved at the end of each fiscal year 
resolutions include settlements  adjudications and dismissals 
the claims are further categorized as either malignant or non malignant

due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate t o cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  we cannot predict the eventual number of cases filed against us  or their eventual resolution  and do not include the reserve amounts for cases filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against us they will result in additional costs arising either from their share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
we review the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and adjust the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as we are not able to estimate our potential ultimate exposure for filed and un filed claims against us  we cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on our results of operations or stockholders equity

significant revenue contracts we are the largest private shipyard in the pacific northwest and are engaged primarily in the repair and overhaul of commercial and government vessels 
our headquarters and shipyard are in seattle  washington on harbor island 
we also have employees located on site at puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton  washington and at the naval station in everett  washington 
the majority of our ship repair business is generated from long term government contracts 
government cost type contracts typically include the following negotiated cost elements direct material  labor and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general  administrative and manufacturing overhead costs 
costs billed to contracts with the government are regulated by the requirements of the federal acquisition regulations far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs we incur and do not bill to the us government in accordance with the requirements of far and cas include  but are not limited to certain legal costs  stock compensation expense  lobbying costs  charitable donations  and advertising costs 
cost type contracts cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable direct and indirect costs incurred and allocable to the contract plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and a stated dollar limitation 
fixed price contracts a fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment because of costs incurred by the contractor 
contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both cost type and fixed price contracts may include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fee  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  management and effectiveness in meeting technical goals 
award fees are determined and earned based on the customer s subjective evaluation of our performance against such performance criteria 
compliance and monitoring on a regular basis  we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  the defense contract audit agency dcaa routinely audits costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government 
the government has the ability to recover any costs which are improperly charged against or allocated to the contracts 
the table below summarizes status of our significant long term contracts and a discussion of each contract follows 
the amounts shown under estimated value of contract are the estimated contract revenues at the inception of the contract

cmt this five year contract was first awarded in fiscal year for the repair and maintenance of all surface combatants frigates and destroyers stationed at the naval station in everett 
the contract was extended by approximately five years in september of we perform the work under a cost plus award fee contract 
we are the prime contractor and lead a team of subcontractors who at times may perform as much as half of the work 
the work is done either at the shipyard and or pier side at the naval station in everett 
we perform the work under this contract at the option of the navy  which has not established a dollar value for the work 
however  we believe that the value may be approximately million to million if all options are exercised 
there is no assurance that the navy will exercise all options  in whole or in part 
cvn this five year contract was awarded in fiscal year and consists of multiple contract options for planned incremental availabilities pias  docking planned incremental availabilities dpias and continuous maintenance and upkeep for the uss lincoln cvn  uss stennis cvn  uss nimitz cvn and uss vinson cvn when they are in puget sound 
the last scheduled planned incremental availability under the current contract was performed on the uss stennis and was substantially completed at end of fiscal year the work includes all types of non nuclear ship repair  alterations and maintenance 
our workforce accomplishes all on board work at puget sound naval shipyard in bremerton  washington  or at the naval station in everett 
the work is performed under a cost plus award fee with performance incentive fee contract and represents the second long term contract for aircraft carrier maintenance awarded to us 
the first such contract was awarded in various regional suppliers and subcontractors support us in this effort 
in response to an rfp by the navy for the next five year  cost type contract for the long term overhaul and maintenance to the nimitz class aircraft carriers cvn home ported in puget sound  we submitted a proposal during the fourth quarter of fiscal year it is anticipated that the navy will make an award to the successful bidder prior to the end of calendar year there can be no assurances that we will be the successful bidder 
uscg polars this five year  cost plus incentive fee multi ship multi option contract with the coast guard  was awarded in and is for the overhaul and continued maintenance of the two polar class icebreakers stationed at seattle  washington 
the options call for planned maintenance availabilities pmas and docking planned maintenance availabilities dpmas for the polar star wagb and polar sea wagb 
the polar star is currently in commission special status inactive and not operational with no known plans to return the ship to operational status 
the availabilities  and their companion planning options  extend through the last dpma ending august  and the last pma ending in september the work to be performed includes availability planning and generalized ship maintenance and repairs as needed  with emphasis on propulsion and deck machinery work 
there is no assurance that the coast guard will exercise all options  in whole or in part 
we are currently preparing to respond to an rfp by the coast guard for the next multi ship multi option contract on these two vessels 
we anticipate an award of this contract to the successful bidder prior to the end of calendar year there can be no assurances that we will be the successful bidder 
uscg healy this fixed price  four and one half year multi option contract with the coast guard was awarded in and provides for the periodic pier side maintenance of the uscgc healy healy at the us coast guard integrated support center in seattle  washington 
electric boat in fiscal year  we entered into a contract with electric boat corporation of groton  connecticut electric boat to support electric boat s work on trident submarines 
we also began work on a follow on contract to fabricate components and to accomplish associated steel outfitting  project management and quality assurance functions 
this contract is associated with the structural retrofit work accomplished by electric boat on the uss ohio ssgn and uss michigan ssgn at the puget sound naval shipyard psns 
we performed fabrication work on the uss ohio under a cost plus incentive fee contract with electric boat  and under a fixed price contract for the associated project management and quality assurance work 
we completed work on this contract in the second quarter of fiscal year we performed work on the uss michigan under a fixed price contract 
in addition to electric boat s contract for the trident s structural retrofit at psns  we entered into a contract to provide a number of repair and alteration services aboard the uss ohio and uss michigan at psns 
our contract with electric boat for work on the uss ohio and uss michigan was substantially completed in fiscal year bath iron works in  we confirmed our expected participation  along with southwest marine  inc  san diego division  on the team lead by bath iron works  a subsidiary of general dynamics nyse gd  to perform post shakedown availability work psa on ddg aegis destroyers destroyers 
the navy contract for this work  which was awarded to bath iron works  includes options for psa work to be accomplished in navy homeports of everett  washington and pearl harbor  hi 
our expected participation will include the performance of the psa work on between one and three destroyers that are expected to be home ported in everett  washington 
work on the first option  as exercised by the navy  began in the first quarter of fiscal year and was completed in the second quarter 
any additional work that we perform for bath iron works will be accomplished under a cost plus award fee subcontract 
the psa work primarily involves the installation of systems and equipment upgra des and or ship alterations as required 
aoe the options for the remaining availabilities on this contract will not be exercised as a result of the navy s decision to decommission or transfer these vessels to military sealift command msc 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we submitted a claim to the navy to settle all outstanding issues related to our emerald sea dry dock  which includes the navy s share of the un recovered repair  maintenance and operating costs of the dry dock 
we believe we are owed these costs under the aoe contract 
on may   the navy denied our claim in its entirety 
we appealed this decision but have not recorded any recovery in the financial results for the current or prior fiscal year 
management s overview the ship repair business consists of individual and short duration repair events  some of which the government exercises under its various multi ship  multi option contracts 
consequently  operating results for any period presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other period 
during the first half of fiscal year  we recorded million  or of our full year revenue 
revenues in the second half of the year were higher than the first half due to higher volumes of both cost type and fixed price work in the second half versus the first half of the year 
revenues for the third and fourth quarters of the year were million 
work volumes in the second half of the fiscal year increased due to work on the aircraft carrier uss stennis  uscgc polar sea and several washington state ferry vessels 
for the full year ended march   we recorded revenue of million  an increase of million  or approximately  from fiscal year revenue of million 
the majority of our navy and coast guard work volumes  as measured by direct labor hours and revenue  are associated with short term less than six months vessel availabilities executed under multi year option contracts 
fiscal year volumes included repair and overhaul work on the aircraft carrier uss stennis  excavator barge  m v malaspina  usns salvor and uscgc healy 
the year on year revenue increase from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher ship repair and new construction volumes on a range of projects  including uss stennis  uscgc polar sea  noaa okeanos explorer  excavator barge  usns flint and usns salvor 
for the fiscal year ended march   we reported operating income of million  which was million more than operating income for the fiscal year ended april  of million 
the increase in operating income for the fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased cost type work  increased profitability on firm fixed price contracts and favorable resolution of delay and disruption claims on fixed price contracts 
operating income by contract type cost plus contracts during fiscal year  we experienced higher work volumes related to cost plus contracts as compared to fiscal year our direct labor hours increased approximately from fiscal year on cost plus contracts 
the year on year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in work under our uscg polar and navy cvn contracts 
operating income attributable to cost plus contracts increased by approximately from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily due to volume increases 
the primary factors that impact operating income on cost type contracts are work volumes  the timing of the award fees and our ability to manage project costs 
fixed price contracts work volumes on fixed price contracts  as measured by direct labor hours  was approximately percent higher in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to ship repair and new construction volumes on a range of projects  including the noaa okeanos explorer  excavator barge  usns salvor  usns flint  m v taku and uscg healy 
operating income on fixed price projects increased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year the primary drivers of improved profitability included several favorable settlements for delay and disruption claims on projects completed in fiscal year  a reduction in reserves for contract losses of million  and generally improved performance on fixed price projects completed in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
time and materials contracts the work we completed under time and materials contracts in fiscal year was modestly higher as compared to fiscal year operating profits on time and materials contracts increased year on year by approximately from fiscal year to fiscal year consolidated operating results

revenues our revenues are primarily derived from work associated with individual and short duration repair events  some of which the government exercises under its various multi ship  multi option contracts 
we discuss many of the factors that influence our business volumes and revenues in business item and risk factors item a these include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  fluctuations in specific private sector customers economic circumstances  the level of competition in the marketplace from domestic and international shipyards  our ability and willingness to compete aggressively for available projects  our capacity and capability to perform available work  the level of government funding available for ship repair projects  the timing and duration of repair availabilities for government vessels  government decisions regarding the allocation of work between public and private shipyards  government decisions regarding the volumes and types of work that will be solicited  and government decisions regarding the specific of contract vehicles that will be used to solicit work to private sector contractors 
consequently  revenues for any given period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in any other period 
we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion method based upon the percentage of work completed to date compared to the estimate of total work at completion 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  we generally reflect any changes from prior estimates in revenue in the current period using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
as a result  our revenues in any given period may reflect the economic benefit or impact of changes in estimates in the current period for work performed in another period 
for cost type contracts with performance incentives or award fees  we only record revenue associated with incentives and award fees that we can be reasonably estimated in the current period 
conve rsely  incentives and award fees that we cannot reasonably estimate are recognized when awarded 
as a result  our revenues in any given period may reflect incentive and award fee revenue associated with work that was performed in another period 
for more information on our revenue recognition methods  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item we recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  an increase of million  or approximately  from fiscal year when we reported revenue of million 
the increase in total revenues is primarily due to higher ship repair and new construction volumes on a range of projects including uss stennis  uscgc polar sea  noaa okeanos explorer  excavator barge  usns flint and usns salvor 
for further discussion please review the above discussion in management overview 
we recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  a decrease of million  or approximately  from fiscal year when we reported revenue of million 
the decrease in total revenues is primarily due to decreases in revenues from work completed under the cvn  coast guard and electric boat contracts 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consist of material costs  subcontractor costs  wages and related payroll benefits associated with our production staff  and depreciation and operating costs associated with our dry docks 
we discuss many of the factors that influence our business profitability and cost of revenues in business item and risk factors item a these include  but are not limited to our willingness to accept lower profits in order to compete aggressively for available projects  our union and non union wage structures  the mix of labor  materials and subcontractor costs on the projects we execute  our ability to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reliable estimates for the work that we compete for and perform  our ability to perform at the costs estimated at the time of the original bid  our ability to recover customer initiated cost increases  the degree to which our business volumes adequately absorb costs as cost of revenues that would otherwise be re corded as manufacturing and administrative costs  our ability to negotiate government cost type reimbursement rates that adequately cover our indirect costs  our ability to effectively manage our operating costs and production efficiency  weather conditions which may benefit or hinder our work during any particular period  our ability to prevent labor actions and work stoppages  our exposure to commodity price fluctuations  and our ability to manage subcontractor performance 
consequently  our cost of revenue for any given period is not necessarily indicative of the cost of revenue that may be expected in any other period 
when estimates of total costs incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned  we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract as cost of revenue in the period the loss is determined 
as a result  our cost of revenue in any given period may reflect the economic benefit or impact of changes in estimates of profit or loss for work that was or will be perfor med in another period 
for more information on our revenue recognition methods  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements item our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is affected by the factors that influence our revenues as discussed above under revenues as well as factors that influence our cost of revenue 
cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or approximately  from fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volumes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the modest decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year versus fiscal year is due to a greater share of our cost of revenues attributed to cost factors that generally command higher margins  lower maintenance costs associated with our floating dry docks and generally improved operating margins on fixed price ship repair projects 
cost of revenues for fiscal year decreased by million  or approximately  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in volumes in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in is primarily attributable to higher overhead reimbursement rates which affect revenues on cost plus work 
administrative and manufacturing overhead our administrative and manufacturing expenses primarily consist of wages and related payroll benefits for our internal administrative and production support employees 
these expenses also include  but are not limited to depreciation  telecommunications  material purchases and equipment rentals to support our production activities  employee training and development expenses  maintenance and lease expenses associated with our equipment and facilities  legal and accounting professional fees  insurance  business taxes  general corporate expenses  and other administrative and manufacturing expenses 
we discuss many of the factors that influence our operating costs in business item and risk factors item a these include  but are not limited to our ability to effectively manage our operating costs  our union and non union wage structures  our exposure to price fluctuations for purchased materials  the degree to which our business volumes are adequate to absorb costs as cost of revenues that would otherwise be recorded as administrative and manufacturing costs  and expenditures needed to ensure continuing service of our owned and leased machinery and equipment 
our administrative and manufacturing overhead includes a mix of fixed costs eg depreciation  facility maintenance  and corporate administration costs  costs which are positively correlated with business volumes eg labor and non labor production support costs  costs which are negatively correlated with business volumes eg production costs not fully absorbed by our business volumes in a given period  and costs which are variable but otherwise uncorrelated with business volumes eg legal and environmental compliance costs 
consequently  our administrative and manufacturing overhead costs for any given period are not necessarily indicative of the costs that may be expected in any other period 
our manufacturing and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue are affected by the factors that influence our r evenues as discussed above under revenues and the factors that influence our manufacturing and administrative costs 
overhead costs for administrative and manufacturing activities increased by million  or  from fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue was approximately and  respectively  for fiscal years and the increase in administrative and manufacturing overhead costs is primarily attributable to volume increases from fiscal year to fiscal year the decrease in administrative and manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by the fact that a significant portion of these costs are fixed 
overhead costs for administrative and manufacturing activities decreased by million  or  from fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead  as a percentage of revenue  were approximately and for fiscal years and  respectively

investment and other income our investment and other income primarily consists of income and expenses that are not associated with our core marine repair  construction or other industrial production activities 
our investment and other income includes  but is not limited to income and expenses associated with our cash and securities holdings  unrealized losses associated with our securities holdings  interest expense on our borrowings  income and expense associated with facilities that we lease to outside parties  income and expense associated with scrap and salvage materials  reimbursement income from medicare part d  various expenses related to retirement benefits paid to certain former employees  and other non production activities

consequently  our investment and other income for any given period are not necessarily indicative of the investment and other income that may be expected in any other period 
investment and other income in fiscal year increased by million  or approximately  when compared to fiscal year the increase in investment and other income reported during fiscal year is due primarily to the continued lease of certain facilities and provision of related services to kiewit general in connection with their construction of the hood canal floating bridge 
investment and other income for fiscal year increased from fiscal year by approximately million or 
the increase in investment and other income reported during fiscal year is due primarily to the aforementioned lease arrangement with kiewit general 
gain loss on sale of available for sale securities during fiscal year  we reported a net gain of million on the sale of available for sale securities 
the decrease in gains from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to market conditions and the sale of securities in fiscal year to fund an extraordinary cash dividend that resulted in the recognition of significant investment gains in the year 
during fiscal year  we reported a net gain of million on the sale of available for sale securities 
the increase in gains from to was primarily due to the sale of securities to pay an extraordinary cash dividend of million on june  income tax in fiscal year  we recognized federal income tax expense of million 
this represents an increase of million in federal tax expense when compared to fiscal year the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and were and respectively 
in fiscal year  we recognized federal income tax expense of million  a decrease of million when compared to fiscal year the effective income tax rates recorded in fiscal years and were and  respectively 
comprehensive income we reported comprehensive income of million for the fiscal year ended  which primarily consisted of net income of million  less pension plan charge net of tax million  and unrealized loss on available for sale securities of million 
for the fiscal year ended we reported comprehensive income of million  which primarily consisted of net income of million and a pension and other post retirement benefits adjustment of million 
the pension benefits funded status is measured as the difference between the fair market value of assets and the post benefit obligation pbo 
as of march   the plan assets exceed the pbo by million 
this creates a positive funded status  which is recognized as a non current asset in the statement of financial position 
sfas also requires disclosures of the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
these amounts consist of gains or losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations or assets which have not yet been recognized in the net periodic benefit cost 
as of march   the pension benefit plan had a net loss of million and a prior service cost of million and a charge of million was recognized in aoci 
as of april   the pension plan assets exceeded the pbo by million 
as of april   the pension benefit plan had a net loss of million and a prior service cost of million 
the other post retirement benefits funded status is measured as the difference between the fair market value of assets and the accumulated post benefit obligation apbo 
as of march   the apbo exceeds plan assets by million 
this creates a negative funded status  which must be recognized as a noncurrent liability in the statement of financial position 
sfas requires disclosure of the amounts recognized in aoci 
these amounts consist of gains or losses  prior service costs or credit and transition obligations or assets which have not yet been recognized in the net periodic benefit costs 
as of march   the other post retirement benefit plan has a net gain of million which was recognized in fiscal year as of april   the apbo exceeded plan assets by million 
this created a negative funded status  which must be recognized as a noncurrent liability in the statement of financial position 
as of april   the other post retirement benefit plan had a net gain of million and was recognized in aoci 
backlog at march   our backlog consisted of approximately million of ship repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of approximately million and million at april  and april   respectively 
our backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year the million backlog reduction from is primarily driven by the absence of a major cvn aircraft carrier availability in since work under our navy and coast guard phased maintenance contracts are at the option of the navy and the coast guard  we cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that we may perform under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in our backlog until the customers exercise the contract options 
environmental matters and other contingencies we provided total aggregate reserves of million as of march  for our contingent environmental and bodily injury liabilities 
due to the complexities and extensive history of our environmental and bodily injury matters  the amounts and timing of future expenditures is uncertain 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these environmental and bodily injury matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
we have various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage of the costs to remediate environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury cases 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit ratings of both of these companies  we anticipate that both parties will be able to perform under their respective policy or agreement 
as of march   we recorded an insurance receivable of million to reflect the contractual arrangements with the insurance companies to share costs for certain environmental and other matters 
included in the reserves are estimated final sediment remediation costs for harbor island of million that we expect to occur within the next years after certain piers reach the end of their useful lives 
we reflect these costs in our balance sheet under environmental and other reserves 
similarly  we reflect the insurance receivable of million relating to these reserves in our balance sheet under insurance receivable 
we continue to negotiate with our insurance carriers and certain prior landowners and operators for past and future remediation costs 
we have not recorded any receivables for any amounts that may be recoverable from such negotiations or other claims 
ongoing operations we expense recurring costs associated with our environmental compliance program as incurred 
recent capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance include the multi year development of a storm water system for approximately million  which was completed in fiscal year past activities environmental we face significant potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at our seattle shipyard the harbor island site and at several sites we allegedly used for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
we have also been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances at our facilities 
we provide information with respect to these contingencies and claims in item in this report 
our policy is to accrue costs for environmental matters in the accounting period in which the responsibility is established and the cost is estimable 
our estimates of our liabilities for environmental matters are based on evaluations of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the results of negotiations with regulatory authorities 
we do not discount these liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide us with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of our operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount greater than our current booked reserves of million 
additionally  we entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
in fiscal year  we spent million for environmental site remediation 
all of these costs are reimbursable through our insurance coverage 
expenses for environmental remediation directed by our management and performed by third party vendors are paid directly to the third party vendors under our insurance policies 
in fiscal year  there were no such third party remediation costs 
most of our environmental site remediation expenditures in fiscal year were related to the harbor island site 
we spent approximately million on environmental site remediation in fiscal year we received reimbursement for all of these costs through our insurance coverage 
in fiscal year  there were no third party remediation costs 
most of our environmental site remediation expenditures in fiscal year were related to the harbor island site 
past activities asbestos and related claims we are named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at our seattle shipyard and closed former facilities 
in addition to us  the cases generally include other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers  and equipment manufacturers as defendants  and arise from injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
we assess claims as they are filed and as the cases develop  dividing them into two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  we categorize certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis as malignant claims 
we categorize all other claims of a less medically serious nature as non malignant 
we are currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the relief sought in all cases varies greatly by jurisdiction and claimant 
included in the approximate cases open as of march  are approximately claimants 
the exact number of claimants is not determinable as approximately of the open cases include multiple claimant filings against defendants 
the filings do not indicate which claimants allege liability against us 
considering known facts  the previously stated claimants is our best estimate 
approximately cases do not assert any specific amount of relief sought 
approximately cases assert on behalf of each claimant a claim for compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases assert million in compensatory and million in punitive damages on behalf of each claimant against approximately defendants 
approximately cases seek compensatory damages of less than million per claim 
the claims involved in the foregoing cases do not specify against which defendants made which claims or alleged dates of exposure 
based upon settled or concluded claims to date  we have not identified any correlation between the amount of the relief sought in the complaint and the final value of the claim 
our insurers and we are vigorously defending these actions 
bodily injury reserves declined from million at april  to million at march  bodily injury insurance receivables also decreased from million at april  to million at march  we classified these bodily injury liabilities and receivables within our consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
we entered into agreements with several of our insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s that resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after we utilize contractual formulas to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgment of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result and as further discussed below  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  we project that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at april   we projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
we resolved malignant cl aims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  our costs related to subsequent claims and for legal expenses previously covered by these insurance agreements may increase 
due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate t o cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  we cannot predict the eventual number of cases filed against us  or their eventual resolution  and do not include the reserve amounts for cases filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against us they will result in additional costs arising either from their share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
we review the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and adjust the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as we are not able to estimate our potential ultimate exposure for filed and un filed claims against us  we cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on our results of operations or stockholders equity 
government contracting the navy s puget sound contracting office has notified us of several instances of potential noncompliance with the cost accounting standards cas relating to our planned incremental availability pia contract to perform repair work on the aircraft carriers located in the puget sound 
the instances under review primarily focus on our long standing allocation methods applicable to other navy contracts and the degree to which indirect costs are allocated to work performed under our pia contract 
we believe that we have valid positions and defenses to the findings of potential noncompliance and we are responding to the notification in an effort to resolve the matter prior to action by the navy to determine that noncompliance exists 
an unfavorable outcome in this matter could have a significant impact on our cost structure with the navy and  depending upon the scope of any retroactive relief sought by the navy  could be material in the period recorded 
at this time  we are unable to estimate our potential exposure for this item 
we have received notice from the dcaa questioning the reasonableness of a payment to one of our subcontractors on the dpia of the aircraft carrier uss john c 
stennis 
we subcontracted the painting of the hull of the carrier which proved more difficult than anticipated due in part to the government limiting access to the hull in the sequence proposed by the subcontractor 
the required change in plan resulted in material overruns in the cost to complete the paint item 
we reached a negotiated agreement of approximately million with the subcontractor resulting in a contract modification issued by the navy s contracting officer in the above stated amount to us under its cost type contract 
the dcaa  in a audit  has challenged the allowability of the payment by us to the subcontractor 
we have submitted a detailed response in support of the propriety of the payment 
there can be no assurance that the dcaa will agree with our position and we are unable to estimate our poten tial exposure for this item 
the dcaa will issue an opinion regarding the payment to the regional navy contracting office who will issue its decision on the allowability of the payment
