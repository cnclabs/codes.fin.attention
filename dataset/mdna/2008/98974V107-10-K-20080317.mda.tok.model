this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those set forth in risk factors in item a of part i of this report and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not intend to update any information contained in these forward looking statements 
overview general we are a full service residential real estate brokerage firm  using our user friendly website and employee real estate agents to provide homebuyers and sellers with high quality service and value 
our website provides users with access to comprehensive local multiple listing services home listings data  as well as other relevant market and neighborhood information 
our proprietary business management system and technology platform helps to reduce costs  allowing us to pass on significant savings to consumers 
we share a portion of our commissions with our buyer clients in the form of a cash rebate  and typically represent our seller clients at fee levels below those offered by most traditional brokerage companies in our markets 
generally  our seller clients pay a total brokerage fee of to of the transaction value  of which to is paid to agents representing buyers 
our net revenues are comprised primarily of commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we record revenues net of rebate or  in new jersey  net of charitable donation or commission discount  if any  paid or offered to our clients 
our net revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions we close and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission we receive on each transaction and varies significantly by market 
we also receive revenues from certain co marketing arrangements  such as our relationship with e loan  inc  which provides mortgage services through the mortgage center on our website and pays us a flat monthly fee that is established on a periodic basis 
generally  non commission revenues represent less than of our net revenues during any period 
we routinely explore our options for entering into additional co marketing arrangements or offering other services related to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home and have begun offering property and casualty insurance including auto insurance services through a subsidiary 
we were founded in  currently have operations in markets  and as of december  employed  people  of whom  were zipagents 
during  we commenced operations in tampa in february  orlando in april  minneapolis st 
paul in may  austin in july  palm beach in september  and the greater 
table of contents philadelphia area in december 
during we commenced operations in naples and tucson in march  denver in april  jacksonville in may  salt lake city and richmond in july  virginia beach and charlotte in august  raleigh durham in september  and westchester county in december 
to date in we have announced we will commence operations in long island and have plans to enter one to three additional markets depending on market conditions 
trends in our business and financial and real estate markets softness in the residential real estate market 
although our business has experienced increasing revenue growth on an annual basis since our inception in  primarily as a result of increased transaction volume and increased average net revenue per transaction  recently revenue growth has slowed based on what we believe to be a transition period in the housing market and the effects of the recent changes in the mortgage lending business 
in we generated million in net revenues  compared to million in the number of our closed transactions increased to approximately  in from approximately  in  and our average net revenue per transaction decreased slightly to approximately  in from approximately  in a decrease of approximately 
our average net revenue per transaction decreased over this period of time in both existing and new markets  as well as in california markets and in markets outside of california 
our transaction volume is primarily driven by the number of zipagents we employ  their productivity  and market conditions 
the number of zipagents we employ has increased to  at december  from  at december  as we introduce new initiatives to improve agent productivity  we may experience temporary declines in the total number of agents although  overall  we expect to continue to increase the number of agents 
as we add additional zipagents  we believe long term we will continue to increase our transaction volume and grow our business  although this may not be the case if the market continues to soften 
if the current softness of the residential real estate market continues or worsens  we expect to see a reduction in the number of licensed realtors nationwide and in our largest markets 
for example  the national association of realtors has reported that its total membership of realtors fell approximately from august  to january  further  according to the california department of real estate  in december  the total number of real estate licensees in california dropped by month over month  the first decline in its agent rolls in over five years  and salesperson examinations in that state decreased by from december to december we expect that overall declines in agent ranks will be comprised disproportionately of less skilled real estate agents  with the better agents continuing in the business 
we also expect that the prolonged softening may deal a critical blow to some of our competitors 
it is our hope that these events  if they occur  will increase the percentage of highly skilled real estate agents on the market  and reduce the competition for such agents  but we cannot know whether this result will occur  or whether the overall decline in the number of real estate agents will make it more difficult for us to employ qualified agents and grow our business 
since early september of we have experienced significant increases in the available inventories of homes for sale in many of our markets  as well as an increase in the amount of time listings are taking to sell 
for example  average monthly inventories in our existing markets increased approximately in compared to pricing increases have also slowed  and some markets have shown declines in median selling prices over this period 
in some markets  home prices have remained relatively stable  but we believe that buyer expectation that prices will decline has resulted in fewer transactions  as buyers postpone transactions until such declines materialize 
for example  according to nar  nationally sales of existing homes fell year over year in december to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of million 
in the state of california  the california association of realtors reported that sales of existing homes declined and the median price of existing homes fell year over year during the month of december in our opinion  these data points support the notion that the housing market is in a period of transition  with more power shifting to buyers from sellers  and that the residential real estate market may continue to soften in the foreseeable future 
during this period of transition we may continue to experience reduced growth rates and decreased agent productivity versus our historical levels as buyers react cautiously to perceived changing market conditions and as we currently intend to open significantly fewer number of new markets in compared to as a result of this contraction in the residential real estate market  our net transaction revenues in existing markets markets opened before january   decreased to million in from million in 
table of contents although we have increased our market share in existing markets  our net transaction revenues have decreased in these markets due to a slight decline in transaction volumes 
new market net transaction revenues increased by million resulting in an overall increase in net revenues of million 
we may not be able to sustain this effort at this rate in new markets  if the softening in the residential real estate market continues 
in addition  we believe that customer acquisition is one of our core competencies  and while we anticipate that the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient number of leads online may increase over time  we expect that we can mitigate some of that impact with repeat and referral business  as well as by increasing our visibility and credibility to potential clients over time 
since our market share has averaged less than over the past year in our existing markets in aggregate  we believe that there is an opportunity to further increase our market share  even if the overall level of sales decline due to changing consumer sentiment  interest rate increases  credit tightening  or other economic or geopolitical factors 
as we implement our business plan for  a key area of focus will be on our existing markets  with a goal of driving their efficiency  productivity and profits 
nevertheless  our losses are likely to continue into  albeit we expect they will be reduced from that which we experienced in impact of softened residential real estate market on availability of mortgages 
we also believe that the prolonged softening of the residential real estate market has negatively impacted  and has been negatively impacted by  the market for home loans  which is a critical market to our business 
as home prices decline  and homeowners find themselves with less equity in their homes  lenders generally become less willing to refinance existing mortgages or to extend home equity loans 
we believe several effects could result  including homeowners being less willing to spend  which would have a dampening effect on the overall economy  and  in turn  dampen the demand for real estate 
also  as home equity leverage decreases  homeowners are more likely to default on their home loans 
as reported by the wall street journal  we believe we have seen some evidence of this occurrence  as the number of short sales which are sales typically involving distressed properties increase during the calendar year these defaults can fuel a spiral of further credit tightening and even less availability of credit  causing a banking crisis 
in addition  as more distressed properties are offered for sale  the resulting increase in inventory of homes for sale could put further downward pressure on home prices 
as the rates in many adjustable rate mortgages reset at higher rates  the number of distressed properties entering the residential real estate market should increase 
we believe we have already seen signs of this phenomenon in early  although we expect significant variation from market to market 
federal legislation has recently been enacted that  among other objectives  seeks to bolster the market for home loans by raising the loan amount that qualifies as a conforming loan to a maximum of  there can be no assurance that this legislation will accomplish its desired objectives  or that it will have a positive impact on the residential real estate market 
the legislation with respect to conforming loans is expected to expire in december  and there is no guarantee that this legislation will be extended to cover future time periods 
in addition  this legislation is expected to take up to several months to implement while required regulations and guidelines are drafted and adopted to implement the features of the new legislation  including the raised loan amount 
as this legislation is implemented  a variety of factors could cause unintended and possibly negative fluctuations in the number of completed residential real estate transactions 
for example  homebuyers may decide to postpone home purchases from early into later in the year to await the implementation of the legislation  or homebuyers may decide to accelerate home purchases from early into late to take advantage of the legislation before its current expiration date 
any of these events could significantly and negatively impact our operating results 
changes to our business model 
over time  we have made significant adjustments to our cost structure and revenue model in order to improve the financial results of our business 
we have modified the compensation and expense reimbursement structure for zipagents over time  and we most recently changed our commission and or expense structure in april currently  our zipagents earn a compensation package consisting of a percentage of the commissions they generate for us that ranges from to or more  based on their productivity  of our net revenues after deducting certain other items 
we also provide our zipagents with health  retirement and other benefits  and pay for certain marketing costs and other business expenses 
zipagents may also be granted equity incentives based on performance 
we may choose or be required to make further modifications to our compensation structure in the future 
for example  nevada recently approved legislation that preempts the federal outside sales 
table of contents exemption from paying minimum wages in that state 
that legislation took effect on november  accordingly  on november  we began paying zipagents minimum wage and  where required  overtime  to our zipagents in nevada 
the minimum wage payments will be offset against future commissions earned  if any 
we have lowered our buyer rebate percentage several times to improve our revenue model 
in march  we reduced our buyer rebate to of our commission from of our commission  up to a maximum of of the home sales price 
the effect of the buyer rebate reduction was recognized over a phase in period of approximately two to four months as the reduction only affected new clients immediately while existing clients continued under the prior rebate policy for transactions already in progress and for transactions opened within a short period after the reduction was announced 
we implemented these buyer rebate percentage reductions for several reasons  including our determination that our growing reputation for superior service allowed us not to compete solely on price  our efforts to improve our revenue model and agent compensation model  and our desire to offer a simplified rebate structure to our clients 
in connection with entry into the greater philadelphia area  we entered the new jersey market  where the payment of cash rebates is currently not permitted by law 
consequently  in new jersey  in lieu of offering a cash rebate to our buyers  we make a donation to a local charity through united way equal to of our commission in cash upon closing 
historically  most of our business has been derived from representing buyers in their home purchases 
one of our growth strategies is to increase the portion of our business that is composed of representing sellers in their home listings 
in addition  a general softening in the residential real estate market  as well as other factors  may cause an increase in the percentage of our business that is composed of representing home sellers rather than home buyers 
as the portion of our listings business increases  and as listings take longer to sell in a market with higher inventory levels  marketing costs generally increase  and commissions can decrease as buyers demand more last minute concessions in price before closing 
if the softened market persists  we may incur greater listing marketing costs and achieve lower commissions and lower profit margins 
fluctuations in quarterly profitability 
we achieved profitability in the first quarter of  the first time in our seasonally slow first quarter  primarily as a result of higher average net transaction revenues and increased transactional volume 
we experienced a net loss in the second quarter of as a result of a one time charge relating to the settlement of a class action lawsuit  we would have been profitable excluding the effect of this settlement 
we achieved profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  but because of seasonality seasonal fluctuations in our business and new market expansion as well as softening in the residential real estate market  we experienced a net loss in the first and second quarters of we achieved profitability in the third quarter of  but experienced a net loss in the fourth quarter of as a result of decreased transaction volume due to our seasonally slow fourth quarter and continued market softness 
in  we reported losses in each quarter due to various factors including seasonality  new market expansion and ongoing market softness 
the third and fourth quarter losses were additionally impacted by tightening in the availability of home mortgage credit and the proposed litigation settlement described in part i  item  legal proceedings 
industry declines in commission percentages 
over the past several years there has been a decline in average commissions charged in the real estate brokerage industry  in part due to companies such as ours exerting downward pressure on prices with a lower commission structure  as well as by what  in our view  appears to be an increase in consumer willingness to negotiate fees with their agents 
we believe that many consumers are focusing on absolute commission dollars paid to sell their home as opposed to accepting a traditional standard market commission percentage 
according to real trends  while the average commission percentage decreased from in to in  total commission revenues increased from billion to billion during that same period  influenced by steadily increasing sales volumes and higher median sales prices 
in the event that commissions continue to decline  we have designed our business model around an attractive cost structure and operational efficiencies which we believe should allow us to continue to offer our services at prices less than those charged by the majority of our competitors 
changes in competitive landscape 
in addition  the competitive landscape in the residential real estate industry is in the midst of significant changes as new business models enter the marketplace 
for example  redfin corporation has introduced a discount brokerage model currently in five states and the district of columbia that 
table of contents allows clients to make offers to purchase homes and to list homes for sale directly online  while receiving a two thirds rebate of their commission 
buyside realty  another discount brokerage  employs agents who are paid salaries and bonuses based on customer service  not commissions  while offering a rebate of their commission 
realestate 
com  which is owned by lendingtree  llc  acts as a lead generator for real estate brokers and agents  and has opened a direct to consumer brokerage service 
trulia  inc operates a residential real estate search engine to connect consumers directly to listings on agent and broker websites 
these companies have limited operating histories upon which to evaluate their operations and future prospects 
however  in order to be successful  our business model must remain attractive to consumers so that we can compete successfully with these newer models as they expand into our marketplaces 
in addition  to remain economically viable  we will need to be able to compete effectively with these new entrants for the acquisition of agents and leads 
industry seasonality and cyclicality 
the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume nationally tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  then gradually slows over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing 
while we believe that  until fairly recently  seasonality has been somewhat masked by our overall growth  we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
we believe that the overall market activity  macroeconomic environment  and periodic business cycles can significantly influence the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time 
generally  when economic times are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  interest rates dramatically increase  or there are market events such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market likely would be negatively impacted 
recently  changes in the mortgage market  including the subprime market  have negatively effected the buying and selling of real estate  as financing and credit standards have tightened 
these factors have tended to depress the real estate activity 
also  there have been numerous reports about the effects of subprime mortgages on the general real estate market 
these reports also tend to have a dampening effect on the general real estate market 
historical variations in us interest rates 
over the past several decades  the national residential real estate market has demonstrated significant growth  with annual existing home sales volume growing from million in to approximately million in and median existing home sales prices increasing every year during that period 
while the volume of existing home sales has declined for at least two consecutive years only twice since  namely through and through  sales did fall from their peak to approximately million in and fell again in to approximately million  and there are forecasts that predict sales will continue their decline in sales volume changes are sensitive to  but do not always follow interest rate changes 
the declines in sales volumes in the through period occurred while interest rates were at historic highs  with long term us treasury rates exceeding 
however  with rates remaining at similarly high levels  sales increased during the period from through average interest rates were lower during the second period of consecutive year declines  through  than they had been in the expansion period ending in many factors influence an individual s decision to buy or sell a home  and we believe that no one factor alone determines the health of the residential real estate market 
for example  a rise in interest rates  tighter lending standards and or disruptions in the availability of mortgage funds could lead to lower demand for housing or put downward pressure on prices because  all else being equal  it should increase monthly housing payments or reduce the amount an individual can pay for a home 
however  it is also our experience that lifestyle influences  such as job relocation  changes in family dynamics or a desire to change neighborhoods  significantly impact the demand for residential real estate 
in addition  periods of interest rate increases are often characterized by improving economic fundamentals  which can create jobs  increase incomes and bolster consumer confidence  all of which are factors that positively influence housing demand 
it is difficult to predict which influences will be strongest  and ultimately whether the housing market will be affected positively or negatively when faced with numerous influences 

table of contents while it is difficult to isolate the cause of recent transaction volume declines and pricing growth slowing in the residential real estate market  such softening has been occurring since the fall of as interest rates have generally increased subject to some recent fluctuations  inventories have generally increased but with significant variations in inventory market to market  and credit standards and financing have tightened  as discussed in more detail above 
other factors have likely contributed to the slowdown as well  such as high fuel prices  persistent press coverage about residential real estate potentially being poised for a correction  and the fact that prices had until that time been increasing at historically high rates 
this rapid price appreciation  which was well ahead of household income growth  along with increasing interest rates has made housing less affordable  which has manifested itself in declining home ownership rates  which peaked in with overall transaction activity declining and sales price increases slowing  overall commissions generated in the industry could decline as well  potentially causing the roughly billion in annual commissions generated in to decline 
however  should the addressable market for our services decline somewhat in the near term due to decreasing sales volume or prices  we believe the overall size of the market on an absolute basis will remain very large  providing ample addressable opportunity for us to continue to grow our business through increasing our market share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we recognize commission revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate or  in new jersey  charitable donation or commission discount  or transaction fee adjustment  as evidenced by the closure of the escrow or similar account and the transfer of these funds to all appropriate parties 
we recognize non commission revenues from our other business relationships  such as our e loan marketing relationship  as the fees are earned from the other party typically on a monthly fee basis 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the transaction has been completed

we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r  except for options granted prior to our initial filing in may of the registration statement for our initial public offering  for which the fair value was determined for disclosure purposes using the minimum value method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost recognized in the years ended december  and includes compensation cost for all unvested stock based awards as of january  that were granted subsequent to our initial filing in may of the registration statement for our initial public offering  and prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  compensation cost for stock based awards granted subsequent  to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and compensation cost for options granted prior to our initial filing in may of the registration statement for our initial public offering  based on the intrinsic value method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates various assumptions including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and consideration of other relevant factors such as the volatility assumptions of guideline companies 
the expected life of options is estimated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option as provided by staff accounting bulletin no

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss tax carryforwards 
during the fourth quarter  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of these deferred tax assets in the future 
consequently  we recognized a net tax benefit of million resulting primarily from the release of a significant portion of the net deferred tax valuation allowance 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that a full valuation allowance should be reinstated against our net deferred tax assets at december  as available evidence  including recent historical results and management s expectations for the future  supported a more likely than not conclusion that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result  the tax expense for the year ended december  includes a non cash expense of million related to the recording of a full valuation allowance 
the company maintains that a full valuation allowance should be accounted for against its net deferred tax assets at december  the company supports the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to negative evidence including recent historical results and management s expectations for the future 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in for federal and for state tax purposes  respectively 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership 
the company has federal and state net operating losses of approximately million at july  that are subject to annual limitations of  net operating losses of approximately million at november  that are subject to annual limitations of  and net operating losses of approximately million at may  that are subject to annual limitations of million 
the difference between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate is primarily a function of the release of the valuation allowance provided against the net deferred tax assets and permanent differences 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  such as changes in our valuation allowance  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes  potential limitations on the use of federal and state net operating losses  and state taxes

table of contents our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process 
due to the structure of our commission arrangements  our accounts receivable are converted to cash on a short term basis and our accounts receivable balances at period end have historically been significantly less than one month s net revenues 
our operating cash flows will be impacted in the future by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable  which are generally paid within the invoice terms and conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
we believe this investment policy is prudent  and helps to reduce  but does not prevent  loss of principal  and results in minimal interest rate exposure on our investments 
as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and our short term investments consisted primarily of investment grade  highly liquid interest bearing securities 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and short term investments are carried at fair value 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are fixed income investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  and  the increase or decline in fair market value of the portfolio would be approximately million and million  respectively 
there have not been any material changes in the past year to our primary market risk exposures  or how these exposures are managed 
exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as we do not have any sales denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
