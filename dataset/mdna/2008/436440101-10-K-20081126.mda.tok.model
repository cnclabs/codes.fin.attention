item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  warranty reserves  certain accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  pension liabilities  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of sales 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the recent financial and economic turmoil or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
our accounts receivable reserves were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in reserves in each of the last two fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in our revenues and associated accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable reserve has decreased as a percentage of sales as a result of our historical collection experience 

table of contents valuation of business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in recent business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our fiscal and fiscal acquisitions  we used risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows  ranging from to 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we did not acquire in process research and development in connection with the fiscal acquisition of biolucent 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and trade names 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
in connection with the sale of certain intellectual property previously acquired from fischer  to siemens ag in july  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents the impairment charge was the result of a higher carrying value of such assets as compared to their fair value 
the charge is a component of the net gain on sale of intellectual property in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and is classified as part of the breast health segment 
subsequent to the cytyc merger  we decided to discontinue the development of cytyc s helica product 
we will not realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included approximately million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge  as a component of our gyn surgical segment  of million in the first quarter of fiscal goodwill in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
additionally  current economic and market conditions may also require an interim impairment test such as a decline in an entities market capitalization 
consistent with prior years  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill for certain of our historical reporting units reporting units prior to the cytyc merger as of the last day of the second quarter of fiscal in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under sfas the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we considered a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
to date  we have not performed the second step of the impairment test as part of our review because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the measurement date from the last day of our second quarter to the first day of our fourth quarter  in order to provide additional time to quantify the fair value of our reporting units and to evaluate the results of the impairment testing 
this change did not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
this change did not have an effect on our financial performance or results of operations  nor was there any impact on prior period financial statements under the requirements of the financial accounting standard board statement no 
the retrospective application as required under sfas no 
was not necessary as no impairment charges had been recorded in any previously recorded financial statements nor did the change in measurement date cause any impairments 
as a result of the change in the measurement date for our annual goodwill impairment test for our historical reporting units from the last day of the second quarter of the fiscal year to the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  we have evaluated  in accordance with paragraph of sfas  whether the detailed determination of fair value of our historical reporting units as of march  can be carried forward to the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter of or if a new test of goodwill impairment is required to be performed for these historical reporting units 
in its evaluation we noted the assets and liabilities of the reporting units had not changed significantly  there was sufficient margin between the carrying amount and fair value determination for each reporting unit and no events or circumstances related to these reporting units would suggest that a current fair value determination of reporting units would result in a valuation lower than the carrying amount of the 
table of contents reporting units 
based on this evaluation we believe we sufficiently meet the requirements of paragraph of sfas to carry forward our estimate of fair value for these reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill for our new reporting units as a result of our acquisition of cytyc corporation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal in performing the test  we utilized the two step approach prescribed under sfas we considered a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we based the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined to be in excess of each reporting unit s carrying value and as a result the second step of the impairment test was not required 
subsequent to september   we have experienced a decline in the price of our publicly traded common stock and related market capitalization such that our market capitalization has declined below the book value of our net assets 
we evaluated this decline in our market capitalization subsequent to year end and have concluded that it was not an indicator of an impairment that existed as of september  we will continue to monitor our market capitalization compared to our book value of net assets and may be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment test in our first quarter of fiscal the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating loss income in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
pension liabilities we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering the employees of our aeg german subsidiary 
on september   the fasb issued sfas sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires an entity to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a defined benefit post retirement plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  measure a defined benefit post retirement plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan in comprehensive income in the year in which changes occur 
sfas does not change the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net income or address the various measurement issues associated with post retirement benefit plan accounting 
as required by sfas  we used a prospective approach in our adoption of sfas as of september   we recognized the unfunded status of our deferred benefit pension plan 
the adoption of sfas did not impact our compliance with our debt covenants under our credit agreements  cash position or results of operations 
as of september   we have recorded a pension liability  based upon an actuarial valuation  of approximately million as a component of accrued expenses and as a component of other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
our actuarial assumptions and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
the discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of theoretical bond portfolios that closely match the various durations of that of our pension liability 
the discount rate assumption we used for our german pension benefits plans was 
the discount rate is dependent on the participation level of the particular countries covered within the plans 
therefore  the discount rate is consistent with the fact that the pension is german based 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no rights of return exist 
table of contents and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  our product arrangements are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began accounting for these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we have concluded that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered product has value to our customers on a stand alone basis and we have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of such services and undelivered products 
accordingly  service revenue representing the fair value of services not yet performed at the time of product shipment is deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the fair value of the undelivered products is also deferred at the time of product shipment and recognized when these products are delivered 
the residual revenue under the product arrangement will be recognized as product revenue upon shipment 
there are no customer rights of return in our sales agreements 
we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for products whose installation is essential to its functionality  primarily related to our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training revenues and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recorded when the services are delivered 
although certain of our products contain operating and application software  we have determined that except for our products obtained with the acquisition of r and the newly released dimensions tomosynthesis d full field digital mammography product dimensions  the software element is incidental in accordance with aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  sop and eitf issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf 
we have determined that the provisions of sop apply to revenue transactions for those products acquired from r technology  inc and the dimensions product 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multi element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
our determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in the multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
we recognize revenue on r and dimensions product sales upon completion of installation  at which time the only remaining undelivered element is post contract support pcs 
upon its release internationally  we completed an evaluation of the software component of our dimensions product in accordance with sop and eitf we noted the following in our evaluation of the software component of our new dimensions product dimensions will be offered in different configurations offering different levels of functionality d vs 
d 
customers who purchase the d configuration will be to able to upgrade the product to a d version and such upgrade will solely represent a software upgrade that will be marketed and sold separately 
this differentiation from our existing d digital mammography product is expected to be highlighted in our marketing literature 
as part of the initial warranty of the dimensions product  customers will receive not only bug fixes related to the software but will also receive any updates and enhancements to the software that are released 
therefore  we concluded that this represents pcs as defined in sop 
table of contents as a result  we have determined that the dimensions product contains software that is more than incidental to the product as a whole and thus  will be accounted for under sop therefore  we will recognize revenue upon installation and acceptance  if required  and will defer revenue based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the initial bundled pcs 
we have determined that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the initial bundled pcs exists based on the establishment of the price for which this element will be sold separately by management having the relevant authority and that it is probable that this price will not change prior to when this service is sold separately 
we have specified the renewal rates at which service can be purchased separately upon expiration of the initial pcs period and those rates have been consistent 
for multi element arrangements where vsoe of fair value of pcs has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts attributable to post contract support are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the contractual term of the support 
as a result of the merger with cytyc  we now sell disposable supplies under customer usage agreements 
under customer usage agreements  we install certain equipment for example  a thinprep processor or a thinprep imaging system at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable supplies at a stated price generally including a usage fee for the equipment over a defined contract term  which is typically between three and five years 
revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as disposable supplies are delivered 
accordingly  no revenue is recognized upon delivery of the equipment 
as a result of the merger with cytyc  we also rent certain other equipment to customers 
revenues from rental agreements are recorded over the terms of the rental agreements 
product warranties products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the warranty accrual in fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in warranty claim activity primarily related to our digital mammography systems 
the increase in the warranty accrual in fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of digital mammography systems sold 
stock based compensation on december  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach under sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted for fiscal years starting after june  as a result  we have adopted sfas r starting in our fiscal first quarter of  which began on september  as permitted by sfas  we historically accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we have adopted the modified prospective method alternative outlined in sfas r 
a modified prospective method is one in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r 
table of contents that remain unvested on the effective date 
as a result  we are amortizing the unamortized stock based compensation expense related to unvested option grants issued prior to the adoption of sfas r  whose fair value was calculated utilizing a black scholes option pricing model 
for options granted after our adoption of sfas r  we have elected to use a binomial model to determine the weighted average fair value of options  rather than the black scholes model  which we had previously used 
in addition  sfas r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas  sfas permitted companies to record forfeitures based on actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas as a result  we have applied the following estimated forfeiture rates for stock option awards in determining the expense recorded in our consolidated statements of operations a range from to in fiscal  in fiscal  and a range between and in fiscal the lower forfeiture rate in fiscal is due to a change in the methodology we are using to calculate this rate as a result of the merger with cytyc 
for further information regarding the assumptions we used in determining our stock based compensation expense  see note to our financial statements 
during the year ended september  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards 
the stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards included million in cost of revenues  million in research and development  million in selling and marketing  million in general and administrative expense and million in restructuring for the year ended september  the compensation expense reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by 
during the year ended september  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards 
the stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards included million in cost of revenues  million in research and development  million in selling and marketing and million in general and administrative expense for the year ended september  the compensation expense reduced basic and diluted earnings per share each by 
as of september   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested market based stock option awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
as of september   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock units that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carry forwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in fiscal  we recorded approximately million of excess tax benefit associated with deductions generated by stock options exercised in fiscal adoption of fasb interpretation no 
on september   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  
table of contents interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
as a result of our adoption of fin no 
 we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million as a decrease to opening retained earnings 
we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of approximately million as of september  and million as of september  at september   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
however  upon the adoption of sfas no 
revised sfas r  business combinations  changes in unrecognized tax benefits following an acquisition generally will affect income tax expense  including any changes associated with acquisitions that occurred prior to the effective date of sfas r 
the increase in unrecognized tax benefits at september  is primarily due to the merger with cytyc 
in the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that the company will reduce the balance of their unrecognized tax benefits by million due to expiration of statute of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities  of which million will reduce goodwill and million will reduce the company s effective tax rate 
our policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and income tax liabilities  when applicable  as part of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of september  and september   accrued interest was approximately million and million  net of federal benefit 
as of september   no penalties have been accrued 
we are subject to united states federal income tax  as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
the current tax returns are open for audit through fiscal we currently have a tax holiday in costa rica that is scheduled to expire in legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
overview we are a developer  manufacturer and supplier of medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical products focused on the healthcare needs of women 
historically  we have developed  manufactured and marketed products focused on mammography  breast care and osteoporosis assessment 
in october  we completed our business combination with cytyc  a company that develops  manufactures and markets complementary products covering a range of cancers and women s health applications  including cervical cancer screening  prenatal diagnostics and partial breast radiation therapy 
on july  we completed our acquisition of third wave  a company that develops and markets molecular diagnostic reagents for a wide variety of dna and rna analysis applications based on its proprietary invader chemistry 
we have historically focused our resources on developing systems and subsystems offering superior image quality and diagnostic accuracy  which has enabled us to capture significant market share and customer loyalty  despite the presence of large competitors 
our combination with cytyc enabled us to benefit from cytyc s strengths in the fields of obstetrics  gynecology  radiation oncology and minimally invasive surgery 
our 
table of contents acquisition of third wave enabled us to further expand our offerings into the clinical molecular diagnostics market utilizing third wave s invader chemistry and its hpv test currently awaiting fda approval 
the dimensions product received ce mark approval in europe in fiscal our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories  including digital and film based mammography systems  computer aided detection cad  breast biopsy guidance systems  minimally invasive breast biopsy and tissue extraction devices  and breast brachytherapy products 
our diagnostic products include the thinprep system  which is primarily used in cytology testing applications  such as cervical cancer screening  and the full term fetal fibronectin test  which offers clinical and cost benefits for the assessment of the risk of pre term birth 
through our recent acquisition of third wave  we have added in vitro diagnostic devices using third wave s invader technology allowing researchers and clinical laboratories to create assays to perform hepatitis c virus genotyping  inherited disorders testing and testing for other mutations associated with genetic predispositions and other diseases such as cystic fibrosis 
we have also submitted applications to the fda for pre market approval of two hpv tests 
our gyn surgical products are made up of the novasure system  which enables physicians to treat women suffering from excessive menstrual bleeding in a minimally invasive manner in order to eliminate or reduce their bleeding  and the adiana complete transcervical sterilization system  which is a form of permanent female contraception intended as an alternative to tubal ligation and for which we are in the process of seeking a pre market approval from the fda 
our skeletal health products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product  our fluoroscan mini c arm imaging products and our esaote line of extremity magnetic resonance imaging mri systems which are manufactured by an original equipment manufacturer 
on april   we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock split has been retroactively reflected in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section of this report 
recent economic developments market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers  patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patient s medical expenses by government healthcare programs  private insurers or other healthcare payors 
the current uncertainty surrounding world financial markets may result in the purchasers of medical equipment decreasing their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities 
additionally  constrictions in world credit markets may result in our customers having increased difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products which may result in decreased sales 
widespread economic uncertainty may also result in cost conscious consumers making fewer elective trips to their physicians and specialists which could result in reduced demand for our products and procedures 
furthermore  governments around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates offered by government sponsored healthcare programs 
if the current economic conditions results in the occurrence of any of these events  our business and prospects may be adversely affected 
recently the value of the us dollar has strengthened against the value of many foreign currencies 
a majority of our sales to international dealers are denominated in us dollars 
the strengthening of the us dollar makes these products less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and margins over time 
in addition  we have international sales  principally in our diagnostic segment  that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the value of these sales will decrease as the us dollar strengthens 
we believe that the strengthening of the us dollar  if it persists  may have a material adverse effect on our international sales and margins 

table of contents acquisitions fiscal acquisitions third wave technologies  inc on july  we completed our acquisition of third wave technologies  inc third wave pursuant to a definitive agreement dated june  we paid per share of third wave  for an estimated aggregate purchase price subject to adjustment of million  including approximately million for the estimated fair value of fully vested stock based awards and approximately million in acquisition related expenses 
we determined the fair value of the shares issued in connection with the acquisition in accordance with eitf issue no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination 
we have concluded that the acquisition of third wave does not represent a material business combination and therefore no pro forma financial information has been provided herein 
our results of operations include the results of third wave since the acquisition date  as a component of our diagnostics reporting segment 
third wave  located in madison  wisconsin  develops and markets molecular diagnostic reagents for a wide variety of dna and rna analysis applications based on its proprietary invader chemistry 
third wave s current clinical diagnostic offerings consist of products for conditions such as cystic fibrosis  hepatitis c  cardiovascular risk and other diseases 
third wave recently submitted to the us food and drug administration fda pre market approval pma applications for two human papillomavirus  or hpv  tests 
our acquisition of third wave has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
this means that the total purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from third wave based on our estimate of their fair values as of the date of the acquisition  and any excess of purchase price over those fair values has been recorded as goodwill 
our reported financial condition and results of operations issued for the period ending september  reflect the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed  and our results of operations also reflect purchase accounting adjustments  such as a significant charge for acquired in process research and development  increased amortization and other expense for the acquired tangible and intangible assets  as well as the interest on the funds we borrowed to complete the acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of july  we are in the process of gathering information to finalize our valuation of certain assets and liabilities 
the purchase price allocation is preliminary and will be finalized once we have all necessary information to complete our estimate  but generally no later than one year from the date of acquisition 
the purchase price allocation is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on information and assumptions further described below 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation  approximately million of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired in process research and development projects 
the amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development represents programs for which some research and development has been completed  but technological feasibility has not been determined or fda approval is pending 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development related to the third wave acquisition represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to these projects using a discount rate of 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the fair value attributable to these in process projects was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 

table of contents the most significant acquired in process technology related to the hpv cervista hr  for which we have estimated a value of approximately million 
we currently sell hpv reagents that detect certain high risk hpv types as analyte specific reagents asrs 
in  third wave began clinical trials for pma submissions to the fda for cervista hr 
we submitted the pma in april and we are anticipating fda approval in the first half of calendar subsequent to receiving fda approval  we expect to discontinue selling the hpv asrs and only sell hpv in vitro diagnostics ivds 
as such  the hpv in process research and development relates only to the hpv ivds and the hpv asrs were valued as completed technology 
the estimated cost to complete this technology is approximately million 
the estimated cost to complete third wave s remaining in process research and development projects in the aggregate is million 
the net deferred income tax liability relates to the tax effect of acquired identifiable intangible assets and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and property and equipment  as such amounts are not deductible for tax purposes 
as noted below  on july   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders and borrowed million under that facility to finance our acquisition of third wave 
cytyc corporation on october   we completed our business combination with cytyc  pursuant to which cytyc became our wholly owned subsidiary 
under the terms of the merger agreement for that transaction  cytyc shareholders received shares of our common stock after adjusting for the stock split effected on april  and in cash for each share of cytyc common stock held by them 
we estimate the aggregate consideration we paid for cytyc  including liabilities that we assumed in connection with that transaction  to be approximately billion 
this estimate includes merger consideration paid to the former cytyc stockholders of billion  consisting of approximately billion in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of approximately billion  million of fully vested stock options issued upon conversion of cytyc stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately million  the assumption of obligations of cytyc under its senior convertible notes due with a principal amount outstanding as of october  of approximately million and an estimated fair value of approximately million  and approximately million of direct acquisition costs 
in connection with the merger  we entered into a credit agreement relating to a senior secured credit facility with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders  in which the lenders committed to provide  in the aggregate  senior secured financing of up to approximately billion to pay for the cash portion of the merger consideration  for repayment of existing debt of cytyc  for expenses relating to the merger and for working capital following the completion of the merger 
as of the closing of the merger  we borrowed billion under the credit facility 
in december  we refinanced a substantial portion of this credit facility through the issuance of convertible senior notes due in the principal amount of billion 
on july   after having paid off all outstanding term loans under the credit facility  we amended and restated the credit facility to finance our acquisition of third wave 
our business combination with cytyc was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with sfas  we were considered to be the acquirer of cytyc for accounting purposes 
this means that the total purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from cytyc based on our 
table of contents estimate of their fair values as of the date of the completion of the business combination  and any excess of purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
our reported financial condition and results of operations issued for fiscal reflect the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed and results of operations after completion of the business combination 
our results of operations also reflect purchase accounting adjustments  such as the write off of acquired research and development  increased amortization and other expense for the acquired tangible and intangible assets of cytyc  and the interest on the funds we borrowed to complete the business combination 
we have allocated the purchase price for our business combination with cytyc to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of their estimated fair values 
we then allocated the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on information and assumptions further described below 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation  we determined that cytyc s identifiable intangible assets include existing technology  customer relationships and trade names 
cytyc s existing technology relates to patents  patent applications and know how with respect to the technologies embedded in its currently marketed products 
in determining the allocation of the purchase price to existing technology  consideration was only given to patent and patent applications that relate to products that have been approved by the fda 
cytyc s customer relationship assets relate to relationships that cytyc s sales force has developed with ob gyns  breast surgeons  clinical laboratories and other physicians 
the trade names relate to both the cytyc name as well as key product names 
we used the income approach to value the existing technology and marketing based intangibles 
this approach calculates fair value by discounting the after tax cash flows back to a present value 
the baseline data for this analysis was the cash flow estimates used to price the transaction 
cash flows were forecasted for each intangible asset  and then discounted based on an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model as well as cytyc s weighted average cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired assets  we considered paragraph of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which lists the pertinent factors to be considered when estimating the useful life of an intangible asset 
these factors included a review of the expected use by the combined company of the assets acquired  the expected useful life of another asset or group of assets related to the acquired assets  legal  regulatory or other contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of an acquired asset or may enable the extension of the useful life of an acquired asset without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
we expect to amortize these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using a method that is based on estimated future cash flows as we believe this will approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be utilized 
acquired in process research and development as part of the purchase price allocation for our business combination with cytyc  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development projects 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of the merger 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the fair value 
table of contents attributable to these in process projects is expensed at the time of the business combination 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 
the fair value assigned to acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the transaction model plus a risk premium 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects  appropriate risk adjusted discount rates were used for the in process research and development projects 
the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology projects 
the acquired in process research and development of cytyc related to the following research and development projects adiana tcs system and expanded labeling of the novasure system  gestiva  the thinprep imaging system  the thinprep processor and helica 
the most significant acquired in process technology relates to the adiana complete transcervical sterilization system for which we have estimated a value of approximately million 
the system  currently under review by the fda  is an incisionless trans cervical permanent sterilization device intended to be used during an office or hospital based procedure 
it consists of three different parts a disposable applicator  an implantable polymer matrix and a radio frequency controller 
during january  the fda requested an additional year of clinical trial data for the product  which we have since completed 
we anticipate additional costs of approximately million and a delay in the commercial release of this product until at least the second quarter of fiscal however  we do not believe this delay will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our rights to gestiva  a drug being developed to be used in the prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth  to k v pharmaceutical company 
the purchase price is to be completed upon final approval by the fda of a gestiva new drug application nda on or before february  and the production of a quantity of gestiva suitable to enable the commercial launch of the product 
the purchase price to be paid to us as a result of the transaction is million in cash  million of which was paid on february   million of which was paid on may  and the balance of which is payable upon the satisfaction of the above conditions 
we have agreed to continue our efforts to obtain fda approval of the nda for gestiva as part of this arrangement  for which we will be reimbursed by k v pharmaceutical 
all costs incurred in these efforts will be reimbursed by k v pharmaceutical and will be recorded as a credit against research and development expenses 
these costs were immaterial during fiscal we have recorded the million as a deferred gain within current liabilities of our consolidated balance sheet 
the gain will be recognized upon final fda approval of the gestiva nda 
we have allocated million to acquired in process research for this product as part of the initial purchase price allocation 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the requisite fda approval  that the transaction will be completed or that we will receive the balance of the purchase price 
moreover  if k v pharmaceutical terminates the agreement as a result of our breach of a material representation  warranty  covenant or agreement  we will be required to return the funds previously received by us as well as expenses reimbursed to us by k v 
in fiscal  we recognized no revenue for the receipt of the initial installment of the purchase price 
rather such payments have been included in deferred revenue and will not be recognized as revenue unless and until the transaction is completed 

table of contents subsequent to the cytyc merger  we decided to discontinue the development of cytyc s helica thermal coagulator system product 
we will not incur any further costs or realize any future cash flows from this product 
we will not realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included approximately million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal the other in process research and development projects we acquired in our business combination with cytyc are at different stages of development  ranging from the early stages of development to phase iib prototype building  ongoing clinical trials and submission to the fda of pma and drug applications 
fda approval or clearance has not been granted for any of the products classified as in process research and development  nor had cytyc received any foreign approvals or clearances for any of these products 
all products classified as in process research and development require various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda before these future products can be marketed 
the estimated cash requirements in the aggregate to complete these remaining products was expected to be approximately million as of september  the successful development of new products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  including  unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products and enhancements  including  for example changes requested by the fda in connection with pma or nda applications for products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot provide assurance that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill our purchase price allocation for cytyc has resulted in goodwill of approximately billion 
the factors contributing to the recognition of this amount of goodwill are based upon several strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the combination 
these benefits include the expectation that our complementary products and technologies will create a leading women s healthcare company with an enhanced presence in hospitals  private practices and healthcare organizations 
we also expect to realize substantial synergies through the use of cytyc s ob gyn and breast surgeon sales channel to cross sell our existing and future products 
our business combination with cytyc provides us broader channel coverage within the united states and expanded geographic reach internationally  as well as increased scale and scope for further expanding operations through product development and complementary strategic transactions 
fiscal acquisition biolucent  inc on september  we completed the acquisition of biolucent  inc biolucent pursuant to a definitive agreement dated june  the results of operations for biolucent have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition as part of our breast health business segment 
we have concluded that the acquisition of biolucent does not represent a material business combination and therefore no pro forma financial information has been provided herein 
biolucent  previously located in aliso viejo  california  develops  markets and sells mammopad breast cushions to decrease the discomfort associated with mammography 
prior to the acquisition  biolucent s primary research and development efforts were directed at its brachytherapy business which was focused on breast cancer therapy 
prior to the acquisition  biolucent spun off its brachytherapy technology and business to the holders of 
table of contents biolucent s outstanding shares of capital stock 
as a result  we only acquired biolucent s mammopad cushion business and related assets 
we invested million directly in the spun off brachytherapy business in exchange for shares of preferred stock issued by the new business 
the aggregate purchase price for biolucent was approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash and  shares of hologic common stock valued at approximately million  debt assumed and paid off of approximately million and approximately million for acquisition related fees and expenses 
we determined the fair value of the shares issued in connection with the acquisition in accordance with eitf issue no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination 
the acquisition also provides for up to two annual earn out payments not to exceed million in the aggregate based on biolucent s achievement of certain revenue targets 
we have considered the provision of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of an acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination  and concluded that this contingent consideration will represent additional purchase price 
as a result  goodwill will be increased by the amount of the additional consideration  if any  when it becomes due and payable 
as of september   we have not recorded any amounts for these potential earn outs 
the final purchase price allocations were completed within one year of the acquisition and the adjustments did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
there have been no other material changes to the purchase price allocation as disclosed in our form k for the year ended september  the allocation of the purchase price is based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of september  fiscal acquisitions fischer imaging on september   we acquired intellectual property relating to fischer imaging corporation s mammography business and products  including the intellectual property relating to its mammotest prone breast biopsy and senoscan digital mammography systems 
the purchase price for the intellectual property was million  approximately million of which was paid out of existing cash with the remaining amount paid through the cancellation of the principal and interest outstanding under a million secured loan we previously provided to fischer imaging on june  we incurred a charge of approximately million to write off in process research and development in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the ftc investigation in the fourth quarter of  we sold  to siemens ag for a cash payment of million  all of the intellectual property we acquired from fischer relating to the mammotest system  subject to our retention of a royalty free  non exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable  worldwide right and license to use that intellectual property 
in connection with this sale we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million and a resulting net gain of approximately million from the proceeds on the sale during the fourth quarter of fiscal aeg elektrofotografie on may   we acquired aeg elektrofotografie aeg and its group of related companies 
aeg was a privately held group of companies headquartered in warstein  germany  with manufacturing operations in germany  china and us aeg specializes in the manufacture of photoconductor materials for use in a variety of electro photographic applications  including for the coating of our digital detectors 
the acquisition of aeg allowed us to take control over this critical step in our detector manufacturing process 
the results of aeg operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are a component of our other business segment 

table of contents the aggregate purchase price for aeg was approximately million consisting of million and  shares of our common stock valued at million  and approximately million for acquisition related fees and expenses 
the acquisition also provided for a one year earn out of eur million approximately million usd which was payable in cash if aeg calendar year earnings  as defined  exceeded a pre determined amount 
aeg s earnings did not exceed such pre determined amount and no payment was made 
we finalized and implemented a plan to restructure certain of aeg s historical activities 
we recorded a liability of approximately million in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  related to the termination of certain employees under this plan and all amounts had been paid as of september  as part of the purchase price allocation  all intangible assets that were a part of the acquisition were identified and valued 
it was determined that only customer lists  trade names  developed technology and in process research and development had separately identifiable values 
the fair value of these intangible assets was determined through the application of the income approach 
customer lists represent customer relationships as aeg has a high dependency on a small number of large accounts 
aeg markets its products through distributors as well as directly to its own customers 
trademarks represent the aeg product names that we intend to continue to use 
developed technology represents currently marketable purchased products that we will continue to resell as well as utilize to enhance and incorporate into our existing products 
the intangible assets are expected to be amortized on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives as the anticipated undiscounted cash flows are relatively consistent over the expected useful lives of the intangible assets 
the estimated million of purchase price allocated to in process research and development projects related to aeg s organic photoconductor coating and selenium product lines 
r technology on july   we completed the acquisition of r technology  inc r 
r develops and sells cad technology and products  an innovative technology that assists radiologists in the early detection of breast cancer 
the aggregate purchase price for r of approximately million consisted of million shares of our common stock valued at million  cash paid of million  debt assumed of million and approximately million for acquisition related fees and expenses 
the results of operations for r have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition as part of our mammography business segment

we recorded a liability of approximately million in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  related to the termination of certain employees and a loss related to the abandonment of certain lease space under this plan 
all amounts related to these liabilities had been paid as of september  we reduced goodwill related to the r acquisition in the amount of million and million during the years ended september  and  respectively 
the reduction in was primarily related to a change in the preliminary valuation of certain assets and liabilities acquired based on information received during the year 
the decrease in goodwill during was related to the reduction of an income tax liability 
the final purchase price allocations were completed within one year of the acquisition and the adjustments did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
there have been no other material changes to the purchase price allocation as disclosed in our form k for the year ended september  as part of the purchase price allocation  all intangible assets that were a part of the acquisition were identified and valued 
it was determined that only customer relationships  trade names  developed technology  and in process research and development had separately identifiable values 
customer relationships represent 
table of contents r s strong active customer base  dominant market position and strong partnership with several large companies 
trademarks represent the r product names that we intend to continue to use 
developed technology represents currently marketable purchased products that we will continue to resell as well as utilize to enhance and incorporate into our existing products 
the estimated million of purchase price allocated to in process research and development projects primarily related to r s digital cad products 
the projects added direct digital algorithm capabilities as well as a new platform technology to analyze images and breast density measurement 
the projects were substantially completed as planned during fiscal suros surgical systems on july   we completed the acquisition of suros surgical systems  inc suros 
suros  located in indianapolis  indiana  develops  manufactures and sells minimally invasive interventional breast biopsy technology and products for biopsy  tissue removal and biopsy site marking 
the initial purchase price for suros was approximately million paid in a combination of cash and million shares of our common stock 
the common stock value of approximately million  cash paid of million inclusive of certain liabilities assumed  and approximately million for acquisition related fees and expenses resulted in an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the results of operations for suros have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition as part of our mammography business segment 
the acquisition also provides for a two year earn out 
the earn out is payable in two annual cash installments equal to the incremental revenue growth in suros business in the two years following the closing 
we have considered the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of and acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination  and concluded that this contingent consideration represents additional purchase price 
goodwill was increased by million during fiscal as a result of payment made related to the incremental revenue growth of suros business in the first year following the closing 
goodwill increased by million during fiscal as a result of the second and final earn out related to suros incremental revenue growth 
in addition to the earn out discussed above  we decreased goodwill in the amount of million during fiscal related to the reduction of an income tax liability 
as part of the purchase price allocation  all intangible assets that were a part of the acquisition were identified and valued 
it was determined that only customer relationships  trade names  developed technology and in process research and development had separately identifiable values 
customer relationships represent suros large installed base that are expected to purchase disposable products on a regular basis 
trademarks represent the suros product names that we intend to continue to use 
developed technology represents currently marketable purchased products that we continue to sell as well as utilize to enhance and incorporate into our existing products 
the estimated million of purchase price allocated to in process research and development projects primarily related to suros disposable products 
the projects were at various stages of completion and include next generation handpiece and site marker technologies 
we have continued to work on these projects and they are substantially complete at september  we had existing relationships with each of aeg  r and suros as suppliers of inventory items 
the supply agreements were entered into in prior years at arm s length terms and conditions 
no minimum purchase requirements existed and the pricing was consistent with other vendor agreements

years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics   n a gyn surgical   n a skeletal health in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to the revenues from the addition of the diagnostics segment  of approximately million  and the gyn surgical segment  of 
table of contents approximately million  that we acquired in connection with our business combination with cytyc  and an increase in revenues from our breast health products of approximately million 
breast health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in worldwide digital mammography system sales  the addition of million of product sales of the mammosite radiation therapy system  a million increase in breast biopsy device sales from suros and an increase of million in product sales of the mammopad breast cushion 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million in digital array sales to an oem as we phase out of selling these arrays to third parties 
the mammosite system was acquired in connection with our business combination with cytyc in october and the mammopad breast cushion was acquired in connection with our biolucent acquisition in september the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems and related components sold  including our r cad software 
in fiscal we sold  digital mammography systems compared to  systems in fiscal this revenue was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices primarily attributable to increased competition  higher dealer sales  changes in product configuration and increased multi system sales 
we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
we expect the growth in the sales of these systems to slow as the market for digital mammography matures 
diagnostics product sales were million in fiscal  due to the inclusion of cytyc results for of the weeks in the current year as well as weeks of third wave revenues of approximately million 
cytyc diagnostic sales include our thinprep and fullterm products 
gyn surgical product sales were million in fiscal  due to the inclusion of cytyc results for of the weeks in the current year 
these sales include our novasure system 
skeletal health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in mini c arm sales worldwide  partially offset by a million decrease in extremity mri sales and a million decrease in bone densitometry product sales 
the increase in mini c arm sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average selling prices related to the commercialization of a new and enhanced product version 
the decrease in extremity mri sales was due to a decrease in the number of systems sold 
the decrease in bone densitometry sales was primarily due to a decrease in the number of used bone densitometry systems and upgrades sold and a decrease in the average selling prices of our bone densitometry systems in the united states  partially offset by an increase in the number of bone densitometry systems sold internationally 
we believe the decrease in our domestic osteoporosis assessment average selling prices reflected a decline in market conditions due in part to a reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis assessment exams 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
the increase in the percentage of product sales generated in the united states in fiscal is primarily due to the additional product sales from cytyc  which had a higher percentage of its product sales from the united states than our historical businesses 
service and other revenues

table of contents service and other revenues is primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in service and other revenues of million in our breast health segment  primarily due to an increase in service contract revenues  and the inclusion of service and other revenues of million from the diagnostics segment as a result of the inclusion of cytyc results for of the weeks in fiscal we believe that the increase in our breast health service and other revenues reflects the continued growth in our installed base of systems and detectors 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales the cost of product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the addition of million of cost of product sales from the cytyc products included in our results since october  and  to a lesser extent  increased product sales of our historical products discussed above 
included in the additional cytyc cost of product sales is approximately million of additional costs related to sales of acquired cytyc inventory that was written up to fair value for purchase accounting purposes as of the date of acquisition 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
these costs as a percentage of product sales decreased primarily due to the higher gross margins earned on cytyc product sales compared to our historical products  partially offset by the additional charges for the write up to fair value for the cytyc inventory sold as noted above 
also contributing to the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue was increased revenues and improved profitability associated with the shift in mammography product sales to our selenia full field digital mammography systems 
our higher selenia system sales resulted in an improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
partially offsetting the decreases in costs as a percentage of product sales were charges associated with a mri inventory impairment charge and related purchase obligations totaling million and million related to sales of acquired third wave inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with purchase accounting in fiscal we have identified certain costs recorded within cost of service and other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations during the first three quarters of fiscal that more appropriately should be classified as cost of product sales 
we determined that the reclassification is not material to our consolidated financial statements and we have corrected the classification in the fourth quarter of fiscal in future filings  we will reclassify these costs related to prior periods to the current presentation  which will result in an increase in cost of product sales and a corresponding decrease in cost of service and other revenues of million in the three months ended december   million in the three months ended march   and million in the three months ended june  cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
table of contents cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to million of amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the cytyc business combination in the first quarter of fiscal the underlying intangible assets substantially relate to acquired developed technology and know how 
these intangible assets are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues cost of service and other revenues increased in absolute dollars primarily related to additional costs from the cytyc business combination of approximately million in fiscal the remainder of the increase was primarily due to personnel and other costs to expand our service capabilities for breast health  especially in the united states  to support our growing installed base of our breast health products as a result of the increased service and other revenues 
we expect our costs of service and other revenues to remain relatively high as a percentage of service and other revenues  reflecting our need to employ the required personnel for warranty  non warranty and installation activities to service our growing installed base of products

research and development expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to the inclusion of million and million of expenses in the current year associated with cytyc related and third wave related activity  respectively  since the close of the business combination with cytyc and the acquisition of third wave 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in mammography related expenses of million in fiscal primarily related to our tomosynthesis project and a million charge for a change in control payment related to the cytyc business combination recorded in the first quarter 
we expect total research and development expenses to increase in fiscal due to the inclusion of a full year of expenses from the third wave acquisition and cytyc business combination and our continued development of tomosynthesis technology for mammography 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to the inclusion of million of expenses associated with cytyc related activity since the close of the business combination and approximately million related to increased compensation and related expenses from the additional sales representatives added from the biolucent acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal also contributing to the increase was approximately million increased commission expense due to the increased product sales 
we expect total sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal with a full year of compensation and related expenses for additional personnel related to the third wave acquisition and the cytyc business combination and an increase in total product sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to million in expenses associated with cytyc related activity since the close of the business combination and an increase of million due to incremental stock based compensation 
we expect total general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal with a full year of compensation and related expenses for additional personnel related to the third wave acquisition and the cytyc business combination 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization expense of acquired intangible assets increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to million of amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the cytyc business combination in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal years and also include the amortization of intangible assets acquired from aeg  r  and suros in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the underlying intangible assets substantially relate to acquired customer relationships and trade names 
these intangible assets acquired in the cytyc business combination are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years 
we expect to incur additional amortization of acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of third wave 
restructuring 
during fiscal we recorded million in compensation charges  including million in stock based compensation  related to the resignation of our executive chairman  which was effective may  impairment of acquired intangible assets 
subsequent to the cytyc business combination  we discontinued the development of cytyc s helica thermal coagulator system product  used for the treatment of endometriosis 
we will not realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included approximately million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal acquired in process research and development expenses 
included in this charge in fiscal is million for in process research and development incurred in connection with our business combination with cytyc as described in further detail above under fiscal acquisitions cytyc corporation 
also included is million for in process research and development incurred in connection with our acquisition of third wave as described in further detail above under fiscal acquisitions third wave technologies  inc interest income 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest income interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due an increase in our investment balances  partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate earned during the current year compared to fiscal 
table of contents interest expense 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest expense in fiscal  these expenses consisted primarily of the interest costs and the related amortization of deferred financing costs related to both the senior secured credit agreement entered into on october  in connection with the cytyc business combination and our subsequent convertible note offering 
in fiscal  these expenses consisted primarily of the interest costs and fees on the unsecured revolving line of credit entered into on july  and amended on september  of million as well as interest costs on notes payable assumed with the acquisition of aeg in the amount of million 
we incurred additional interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with our borrowing of million on july  to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of third wave 
other expense income  net 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount other expense income  net in fiscal  these balances were primarily related to foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million and a decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our serp of approximately million 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established certain debt agreements denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which certain of our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 
in fiscal  other income related primarily to the increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our serp 
provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount provision for income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carry forwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents our effective tax rate for fiscal was of the pre tax loss 
for fiscal  our effective tax rate was affected by the in process research and development and intangible asset impairment charges we incurred in connection with our business combination with cytyc and the in process research and development that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of third wave technologies 
absent the in process research and development and intangible asset impairment charges  our effective tax rate would have been approximately for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was of pre tax earnings 
this represented our normalized rate of approximately reduced by certain tax credits 
our net deferred tax liability increased approximately million in fiscal primarily due to the increase of intangible assets as a result of the cytyc merger  for which the related amortization is not deductible for tax purposes 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately of pre tax earnings in fiscal segment results of operations as discussed above  we are now reporting our business as four segments breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income breast health revenues for fiscal increased primarily due to the million increase in product sales discussed above and due to a million increase in service revenues that was primarily related to the increased number of service contracts for the increased number of selenia systems in our installed base 
operating income for this business segment increased primarily due to the increased revenues 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal our gross margins improved from the increase in product revenues of our more profitable selenia systems versus our analog mammography systems and  to a lesser extent  higher margins realized on our mammosite product  acquired as part of the cytyc merger 
in addition  higher total revenues including higher selenia system sales have allowed for the greater absorption of manufacturing costs 
partially offsetting these improvements was a charge of million for the write up to fair value of mammosite rts inventory sold  primarily during the first quarter of fiscal operating expenses for this business segment increased in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of million of operating expenses from the mammosite business as well as from increased operating expenses in support of our growing selenia business 
also contributing to the increases during the year was an increase in stock based compensation of million  as well as a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our executive chairman in may 
table of contents diagnostics 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss diagnostics revenues  which include our thinprep  fullterm and third wave products  totaled million in fiscal our gross margin in this business segment was  including charges of million and million  respectively  for the write up to fair value of the cytyc inventory sold during the first quarter and the third wave inventory sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal the operating loss also included an million charge for in process research and development as a result of the cytyc business combination in the first quarter  a million charge for in process research and development as a result of the third wave acquisition in the fourth quarter  stock based compensation of million and a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our executive chairman in may gyn surgical 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss gyn surgical revenues  which include our novasure products and adiana systems under development  totaled million in fiscal in the second and third quarters  we believe that sales of the novasure system were adversely affected by a modest softening in sales to the hospital based market  as well as lower than expected customer inventory utilization 
our sales to both the hospital market and office based market generally have been based upon current order bookings for immediate shipment with little or no backlog 
over the last three quarters  we have refocused our sales efforts and programs to increasing longer term customer commitments 
however  while we cannot assure that we will be successful  our goal is to have a continuing increase in novasure system backlog  followed by a continued increase in sequential growth of revenue during fiscal with sales to the physician office based market playing a role in that increase 
our gross margin in this business segment was during this period and includes a charge of million for the write up to fair value of the cytyc inventory sold during the first fiscal quarter of the operating loss for fiscal also includes a million charge for in process research and development as a result of the cytyc business combination and a million impairment charge of the helica thermal coagulator system intangibles 
this segment included stock based compensation of million in fiscal  as well as a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our executive chairman in may 
table of contents skeletal health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income skeletal health revenues increased in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to the million increase in product sales discussed above 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal operating income and gross margin for the skeletal health segment increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to the increased revenues and due to improved absorption as a result of manufacturing additional products in the facility where the skeletal health products are produced  partially offset by charges associated with mri inventory and purchase obligations recorded in fiscal totaling million compared to million in fiscal skeletal health costs and expenses included stock compensation of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health skeletal health in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenues from our breast health products  led by an increase in the number of selenia digital mammography systems sold  and to a lesser extent  increased breast biopsy sales from suros  acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the inclusion for the full year of sales from aeg  acquired during the third quarter of fiscal also contributing to the increase was an increase in sales of mini c arm systems  offsetting these increases was a decrease in other skeletal health sales in fiscal breast health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in digital mammography system sales  an increase of million in breast biopsy device sales from suros  million in additional sales from aeg and a million increase in cad product sales from r suros and r are entities we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and aeg was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal prior to our acquisition of r we had sold cad products together with our digital mammography systems  primarily from r as a distributor 
the increase in cad product sales represents the additional cad sales made without our digital mammography systems 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in multicare stereotactic table sales and an million decrease in analog mammography systems sales 
the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems and related components sold  primarily in the united states 
in fiscal  we sold  digital mammography systems compared to systems in fiscal this revenue 
table of contents was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices primarily attributable to increased competition  higher dealer sales  changes in product configuration and increased multi system sales 
we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
the decrease in multicare stereotactic tables was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold worldwide in fiscal compared to fiscal due in part to higher demand in related to increased sales activity following our acquisition of fischer s mammography intellectual property in september and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in average selling prices primarily in the united states 
the decrease in sales of our analog mammography systems was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold worldwide and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in average selling prices 
we believe that this decrease in analog system sales was primarily due to the shift in product sales to digital systems 
skeletal health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in product sales in the united states primarily due to a decrease in the number of bone densitometry systems sold and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average selling prices 
this decrease was partially offset by an million increase in our mini c arm system sales 
the increase in mini c arm revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the number of systems sold in the united states and europe 
we believe this decrease in our domestic unit sales reflected a decline in market conditions due to a reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis assessment exams 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
we believe the higher growth in sales dollars to the united states market was primarily due to an increase in demand for our selenia digital mammography system as adoption of digital mammography was occurring at an increased rate in the united states as compared to international markets 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in service contract revenues of million from an increase in the number of service contracts sold and  to a lesser extent  an increase of million in training revenues in our breast health segment 
we believe that these increases reflected the continued growth in our installed base of products  especially selenia  and from the addition of service and other revenues from r and suros which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales 
table of contents cost of product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  in absolute dollars  primarily due to the increased product sales discussed above 
cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to increased revenues and improved profitability associated with the shift in mammography product sales to selenia and  to a lesser extent  the lower cost of cad as a result of our acquisition of r the selenia systems have significantly higher selling prices  more than offsetting the higher costs of the product  when compared to analog mammography 
in addition  fiscal includes results of the recently acquired r and suros product lines for the entire year which have lower costs as a percentage of sales 
our higher selenia sales resulted in an improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
these improvements were partially offset by fewer bone densitometry systems sold  primarily in the united states  which negatively impacted the absorption of fixed overhead and a reduction in the average selling prices for these systems 
fiscal includes million of additional costs related to the sales of acquired aeg  r and suros inventory that was written up to fair value for purchase accounting purposes as of the date of each acquisition 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets costs of product sales amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to the increase in acquired intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of aeg  r  suros and the intangible assets acquired from fischer imaging during fiscal  as well as the acquisition of biolucent in fiscal the underlying intangible assets substantially relate to acquired developed technology and know how 
these intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues cost of service and other revenues increased in absolute dollars primarily related to additional personnel and other costs to expand our service capabilities  especially in the united states  to support our growing installed base of products and increased warranty costs

also contributing to the increase was an increase in mammography related expenses of million primarily related to our tomosynthesis development project 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the dollar increase was primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs related to the acquisitions of aeg  r and suros of million

breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income breast health revenues  as discussed above  increased primarily due to the million increase in product sales  an increase of million in service and other revenues primarily related to the increased number of systems in our installed base  and incremental revenues of million as a result of the aeg acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal discussed above 
operating income for this business segment increased primarily due to the increased revenues 
our gross margin in this business segment increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal our gross margins improved from the increase in product revenues of our more profitable selenia systems versus our analog mammography systems as well as a full year of higher margin product sales from the recently acquired businesses of r and suros 
in addition  higher total revenues including higher selenia sales have allowed for the greater absorption of manufacturing costs 
this improvement in the gross margin was offset in part by an increase in service related costs due to an increase in the number of our service personnel and an increase in warranty costs in the current fiscal year 

table of contents operating expenses for this business segment increased in fiscal primarily due to increased operating expenses in support of our growing selenia business  in particular increased selling expenses primarily due to the higher revenues  and as a result of the suros and aeg acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  the r acquisition 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in intangible amortization of million  as well as an increase in stock based compensation of million 
fiscal included million of charges for acquired in process research and development related to our acquisitions

skeletal health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income skeletal health revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the million decrease in product sales discussed above and an million increase in service revenues  partially offset by an increase in mini c arm sales of million 
the decrease in service revenues was primarily due to a decrease in training revenues 
operating income for skeletal health decreased primarily from the decrease in product sales as well as a million extremity mri inventory write down and insufficient revenue volume for the third party extremity mri systems to cover the fixed costs  primarily headcount related  to support the distribution of these systems  partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in skeletal health gross margin reflects the decrease in product sales  the lower average selling prices  and the million extremity mri inventory write down mentioned above 
operating income partially benefited from lower overhead allocations as there were higher allocations of overhead in the current year to the breast health business segment reflecting the recent acquisitions and higher growth of that segment 
liquidity and capital resources at september  we had approximately million of working capital 
at that date  our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased slightly by approximately million during fiscal  primarily due to cash utilized in our investing activities including cash used to pay the merger consideration for the cytyc business combination and third wave acquisition and  to a lesser extent  to purchase property and equipment as well as financing activities relating to our repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit agreement 
these cash uses were partially offset by cash received from our issuance of convertible notes  the exercise of common stock options  cash acquired as a result of our business combination with cytyc and cash provided by both our legacy and cytyc operating activities 
our operating activities provided us with million of cash  which included a net loss of million for the year mostly relating to non cash charges of million of acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization of an aggregate million  million write up of acquired cytyc and third wave inventory  amortization of deferred financing costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million  which were partially offset by a million tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options and a million deferred tax benefit

the cash used by these 
table of contents changes in our current assets and liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in income tax refundable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increased sales volume  especially from the addition of cytyc revenues since the merger date 
the increase in inventory was primarily related to the addition of cytyc inventories since the merger and an increase in our historical products to support the increased sales  especially for digital mammography 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of merger related fees and expenses 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the timing of payment of prepaid items 
the decrease in income taxes refundable was due to the use of acquired cytyc net operating loss carryforwards and tax overpayments  and the tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options discussed above to offset current income taxes payable 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of deferred service contracts for our historical business as well as amounts added by the cytyc operations after the close of the business combination 
in fiscal  we used approximately billion of cash in investing activities 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to the billion and million  net of cash acquired  used to complete the business combination with cytyc on october  and the acquisition of third wave on july   respectively 
we also used million for purchases of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of manufacturing  demonstration and test equipment and computer hardware 
we invested million in equipment under customer usage agreements

sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 defers the effective date of sfas for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
therefore  we are required to adopt sfas on the first day of fiscal for financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we are required to adopt sfas on the first day of fiscal for all other nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows an entity to elect to record financial assets and liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition on a contract by contract basis 
subsequent changes in fair value would be recognized in earnings as the changes occur 
sfas also establishes additional disclosure requirements for these items stated at fair value 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   which is our fiscal year  with early adoption permitted  provided that we also adopt sfas the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
states that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
if an entity s expectations change such that it does not expect it will need the goods to be delivered or the services to be rendered  capitalized nonrefundable advance payments should be charged to expense 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
the consensus may not be applied to earlier periods 
early adoption of the provisions is not permitted 
our historical policy has been to capitalize upfront nonrefundable advance payments related to research and development activities and expense these amounts as the goods are delivered or services rendered 
therefore  the adoption of this consensus should not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
that replaces sfas s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the statement retains the guidance in sfas for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas r will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination must generally be expensed prior to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first 
table of contents annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas amends arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  by requiring expanded disclosures about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires increased qualitative  quantitative  and credit risk disclosures  including a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
we are required to adopt sfas effective for the quarter ending march  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under sfas the fsp amends paragraph d of sfas to require an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement  consistent with its expected use of the asset 
the fsp also requires the following incremental disclosures for renewable intangible assets the weighted average period prior to the next renewal or extension whether explicit and implicit for each major intangible asset class the entity s accounting policy for the treatment of costs incurred to renew or extend the term of a recognized intangible asset for intangible asset renewed or extended during the period for entities that capitalize renewal or extension costs  the costs incurred to review or extend the asset  for each major intangible asset class the weighted average period prior to the next renewal or extension whether explicit and implicit for each major intangible asset class the fsp is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the beginning of fiscal for us 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
accordingly  the fsp would not serve as a basis to change the useful life of an intangible asset that was acquired prior to the effective date 
however  the incremental disclosure requirements described above 
table of contents would apply to all intangible assets  including those recognized in periods prior to the effective date of the fsp 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this fsp will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp applies to convertible debt instruments that  by their stated terms  may be settled in cash or other assets upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under sfas the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of this fsp must be separately accounted for in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the excess of the principal amount of the debt over the amount ultimately allocated to the liability component is required to be amortized to interest expense using the interest method 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
as a result  we will adopt this standard at the beginning of fiscal this fsp must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the retrospective adoption of this fsp will increase our historical reported interest expense from december  issuance date of the convertible notes forward 
the adoption of fsp apb will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows 
however  upon adoption in fiscal we expect to revise prior periods by reclassifying approximately million of our convertible notes to additional paid in capital  resulting in a debt discount 
our fiscal non cash interest expense will increase by approximately million  resulting in a restated diluted net loss per share of approximately per share  net of tax 
on may   statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas was issued 
this standard identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf issue no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
eitf issue no 
is effective for financial statement issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and debt obligations 
except for our outstanding convertible note  the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
as of september  we have billion of convertible notes outstanding 
the fair value of our convertible notes was approximately billion as of september  based on the trading price as of that date 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we incur interest expense on borrowings outstanding under our amended credit agreement and on the debt assumed as a result of our acquisition of aeg 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  with respect to the 
table of contents borrowings under the term loan a of either the base rate the greater of the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal and the federal funds effective rate plus or the eurodollar rate  plus and with respect to the term loan b of either the base rate the greater of the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal and the federal funds effective rate plus or the eurodollar rate  plus 
on july   the date we entered into the amended credit agreement  we borrowed million under the term loan a and million under the term loan b 
as of september   there was approximately million outstanding under the amended credit agreement  including million under the term loan a facility which matures on september  and million under the term loan b facility which matures on march  the terms of the aeg debt agreements have various maturities ranging from december  through march  interest rates are variable and had weighted average interest rates ranging from to during the twelve months ended september  we may also incur interest expense on loans made under a european line of credit that accrues interest at the europe interbank offered rate  as defined 
at september   there were no amounts outstanding under the european line of credit 
these debt obligations are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
a adverse movement increase in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
the return from cash and cash equivalents will vary as short term interest rates change 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
interest income on our cash and cash equivalents is recorded as a component of other income in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we maintain sales and service offices outside the united states  have manufacturing facilities in germany  costa rica and china  and conduct business worldwide 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our foreign sales are denominated in local currencies  the euro or us dollars 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses are positively affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the united states dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
during fiscal  and  we incurred foreign exchange losses gains of approximately   and  respectively
