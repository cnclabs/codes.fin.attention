item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and risk factors management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained within this report  including the notes thereto 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that are beyond our control 
these include the factors set forth in risk factors and forward looking statements 
accordingly  past results and trends may not be reliable indicators of future results or trends 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors discussed in this report could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a financial holding company offering a broad range of community banking and financial services through our locations in kansas  missouri  nebraska and colorado through our wholly owned banking subsidiaries  teambank and colorado national bank 
our presence in kansas consists of nine locations in the kansas city metropolitan area and three locations in southeast kansas 
we operate two locations in southwestern missouri  three in metropolitan omaha  nebraska  and four in the colorado springs  colorado metropolitan area 
our total assets over the past ten years have grown from million at january  to million at december  the growth in assets and the corresponding increase in earnings were achieved primarily through purchases of branches  purchases of community banks  and internal branch expansions 
our branch expansion includes growth at existing branches  primarily through the addition of loan officers at those locations  as well as the opening of new branches 
increased legal lending limits have also contributed to our growth  allowing our loan officers to make larger loans  thereby further contributing to our asset growth 
accompanying the growth were increased operating expenses as well as increases in provisions for loan losses and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisitions  and in some instances  issuance of our common stock in conjunction with the acquisitions 
our experience is that it takes to months to realize meaningful net income improvements from acquisitions due to our emphasis on retaining key employees rather than the immediate implementation of significant cost reduction measures 
the following table presents certain financial data for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands  except per share data as of and for years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net income   basic income per share diluted income per share return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets efficiency ratio at december  total assets were million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable of million 
the increase in loans was offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and a decrease in investment securities of million 
net income totaled million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million  or  coupled with a decrease of  in provision for loan losses and an increase of  in non interest income  offset by an increase in non interest expense of million  or 
the million increase in non interest expense was largely due to lawsuit settlements and related expenses and increased salaries  net of the reduction in the trust preferred securities redemption amortization expense 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements and related notes  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statement of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the period presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses one of our critical accounting policies relates to the allowance for loan losses and involves significant management valuation judgments 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews considering historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  an evaluation of economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas and other areas where we have loans receivable  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and additional allowances for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered doubtful 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance provided is subject to review by our regulators 
management believes that the allowance is adequate for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
though management uses available information to provide appropriate allowances for inherent losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on borrowers circumstances and changes in economic conditions 
impairment of goodwill analysis the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  require that goodwill be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred 
the evaluation of possible impairment of intangible assets involves judgment based upon short term and long term projections of future performance 
the company has completed its most recent evaluation of goodwill and determined that no impairment exists for the year ended december  there was no impairment of goodwill in deferred income taxes the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  establish financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns related to deferred income 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
analysis of the results of operations net interest income our income is derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  and interest bearing deposits  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and interest rates earned and expensed 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the amount of interest income or interest expense and the average rate for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate for the periods indicated 
year ended december  year ended december  average balance interest average rate average balance interest average rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable  net   investment securities taxable   investment securities nontaxable   federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits  other assets total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking   time deposits     federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase   notes payable and federal home loan bank advances  subordinated debentures    total interest bearing liabilities  net interest income tax equivalent  interest rate spread net interest earning assets   net interest margin ratio of average interest bearing liabilities to average interest earning assets loans are net of deferred costs  less fees 
non accruing loans are included in the computation of average balances 
interest income includes loan fees 
these fees for the years ended december  and  were  and  respectively 
yield is adjusted for the tax effect of tax exempt securities 
the tax effects for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
interest expense on federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase includes imputed interest on premises under construction 
imputed interest for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
net interest margin decreased five basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin was largely due to higher average balances of interest bearing liabilities  coupled with higher average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which were not fully offset by the increases in average balances or average yields on average earning assets 
we expect continued pressure on our net interest margin  as some of our loan portfolio reprices with the decrease in the prime rate  while our deposit rates  which are highly correlated to treasury rates  are not expected to decline at the same rate 
total interest income on a tax equivalent basis for was million  representing an increase of million  or  from million for the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in interest income on loans receivable 
interest income on loans receivable increased million due to a million increase in the average balances of loans receivable to million in from million in  coupled with a basis point increase in the yield on loans receivable in compared to the increase in the yield of loans receivable reflected the increase in the rates applied to loans that re priced in as required by the notes terms and the pricing of newly originated loans at higher rates 
the average yield on taxable investment securities increased basis points from in to in offsetting the increase in interest income due to higher yields was a decrease in average balances of approximately million  resulting in a decrease in interest income on taxable investment securities of approximately thousand 
the net increase in interest income as a result of the higher average yield and lower average balance on taxable investment securities was thousand 
cash flow from the reduction of investment securities was redirected to fund loan growth 
total interest expense was million for  a million  or a increase from million in the increase was primarily related to the increase in average balances and average rates paid on time deposits  which increased to in from in  representing a basis point increase 
the majority of the increase in average balances and average rates paid on time deposits came from brokered certificates of deposit  which increased million during as a method to fund loan growth 
the brokered certificates of deposit carried an average rate of  compared to on all other time deposits  thereby increasing the total average rates paid on total time deposits 
the average rates paid on interest bearing savings and checking deposits increased basis points from in to in as a result of the changes described above  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million during  representing an increase of million  or  compared to million in the average rate paid on our subordinated debentures  which we restructured in september  was for compared to for pursuant to the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no

the following table presents the components of changes in our net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  attributed to volume and rate 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior fiscal year s average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to changes in interest rates are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior fiscal year s average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and change in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume

provision for loan losses the provision for losses on loans represents management s estimate of the amount necessary to be charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas or areas that we have loans receivable  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine the level of provision to be recognized in the allowance  and after considering the above factors  management recorded a provision for loan losses on loans totaling million for the year ended  and million for the year ended the decrease in the provision recorded in compared to was primarily a result of improved asset quality in compared to  as non performing loans decreased by million  therefore not necessitating further amounts of loan loss reserves 
the improved asset quality resulted in the decrease of approximately million in the provision for loan losses recorded for specific allowances associated with loans that management considers the ultimate collectibility is doubtful  despite the fact that loan balances increased more in than in non interest income the following table sets forth non interest income for the indicated periods 
years ended december in thousands service charges   trust fees brokerage service revenue gain on sales of mortgage loans loss on sales of investment securities mortgage servicing fees  net of amortization merchant processing fees atm and debit card fees income from investment in bank owned life insurance other total non interest income   non interest income was million for  a million  or  increase from this increase was primarily a result of a decrease of loss on the sale of investment securities of  as a loss of  was recorded in as a result of restructuring certain investments maintained in our portfolio in order to achieve higher yields in the future 
other non interest income increased  primarily due to  of income related to credit life insurance 
gain on sales of mortgage loans remained stable at million in we expect gain on sales of mortgage loans to remain relatively stable in the near future as a result of the current interest rate environment  coupled with increased loan originations at our new branches 
service charges decreased approximately  for the year ended compared to the year ended due to decreased overdraft fees and decreased service charges 
non interest expense the following table presents non interest expense for the indicated periods years ended december in thousands salaries and employee benefits   occupancy and equipment   data processing   professional fees   marketing supplies intangible asset amortization trust preferred securities redemption amortization lawsuit settlements and related expenses other   total non interest expenses   non interest expense was million for the year ended  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended salaries and employee benefits increased approximately  or  primarily as a result of hiring additional personnel to staff the new branches and increased compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased  during compared to  largely due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of the three year options  which reprice each quarter due to their discretionary vesting nature 
occupancy and equipment increased approximately  during primarily due to the re evaluation of the useful lives of our fixed assets and to immaterial corrections of prior period depreciation differences  coupled with increased maintenance and utilities expenses 
data processing fees are expected to decrease in  as we have signed a new agreement with our core processor and have renegotiated our processing rates 
in  our professional fees included approximately  of expense related to complying with the internal control provisions of sarbanes oxley 
we do not anticipate having these expenses in the future  however  there will be ongoing expense associated with maintaining our compliance with of sarbanes oxley 
the largest increase in non interest expense was the  charge taken as a result of lawsuit settlements and related charges 
see recent developments under item business for more information on these charges 
this was largely offset by the reduction in the  charge taken as a result of the restructuring of the trust preferred securities in see note subordinated debentures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the restructuring of the trust preferred securities and the related charge in as discussed in item i business of this report under deposit insurance premiums  we have a one time credit to apply towards fdic deposit insurance premiums under the new pricing structure established and implemented by the fdic in we expect to use our remaining credit towards these insurance premiums in the first two quarters of  however  we expect that our credit will be used up by the third quarter of  and therefore  we expect our deposit insurance premiums to increase by approximately  in and by another approximately  in  or  over levels 
deposit insurance premiums are determined based on our level of deposits  therefore  as our deposits increase  so will our associated deposit insurance premiums 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of  for compared to  for  representing an increase of  or 
the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
an increase in taxable income contributed to the higher effective tax rate in compared to the effective tax rate was less than the statutory federal rate of in and primarily due to municipal interest income and non taxable income from our investment in bank owned life insurance 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was largely due to a decrease in the amount of reversals of previously provided tax reserves from closed tax years as the related statutes of limitations expired 
comprehensive income comprehensive income is the total of net income and other comprehensive income 
our other comprehensive income is composed of the change in equity resulting from an increase or decrease in the market value of our available for sale investment securities  due to the changes in interest rates  net of tax 
comprehensive income was million for the year ended  an increase of million from million for the year ended the increase was primarily the result of the  increase in net income  offset by a  decrease in other comprehensive income as the change in unrealized losses experienced during decreased compared to the change in unrealized losses experienced during analysis of financial condition overview total assets were million at december   an increase of million  or  from million in total assets as of december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable of million  offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and a decrease in investment securities available for sale of million 
loan portfolio composition the following tables present the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated

the increase in total loans receivable was primarily due to a million increase in construction and land development loans 
million of the loan growth in was as a result of purchased participation loans  all of which were classified as construction and land development loans  with the remainder of the total loan growth being generated through our network of branches and lending officers 
slightly offsetting the increase in our construction and land development and commercial real estate loans was a decrease in our one to four family loans and our lease financing receivables of million and million  respectively 
installment loans have continued to decrease as a percentage of our loan portfolio over the past several years as we have placed more emphasis on growing our small to mid size business lending 
loans secured by real estate loans secured by real estate represent our largest loan category 
at december  these loans totaled million  a million  or  an increase from million at december  the increase was generated from a million  or increase in construction and land development loans and a million increase in non farm  non residential commercial loans secured by real estate from million at december  to million at december   an increase of 
we have experienced steady growth in this area over the last five years  and we anticipate continued growth in this loan portfolio with our continued emphasis on small to mid size business loans in our metropolitan markets 
other loans secured by real estate  including one to four family  farmland and multifamily loans  decreased a combined million during our one to four family loan portfolio continued its decline of recent years and decreased million  or  in part of the decline in the one to four family loan portfolio in recent years has been due to the interest rate environment in which customers have been more inclined to lock in the low rates through fixed rate loans 
we typically sell fixed rate one to four family loans to the secondary market instead of holding such loans in our one to four family portfolio  resulting in the decline in this portfolio 
included in one to four family loans were loans held for sale of million at december  and million at december  we occasionally retain the servicing rights on these loans 
capitalized servicing rights are recorded at the time the loan is sold  thereby increasing the gain on sale by such amount 
the balance of our mortgage servicing rights was  at december  compared to  at december  commercial and agricultural commercial and agricultural loans were million at december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  commercial loans include loans to service  retail  wholesale  and light manufacturing businesses 
agricultural loans include loans to farmers for production and other agricultural needs 
commercial loans were million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
at december   agricultural loans were million compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
installment and other installment and other loans include automobile and other personal loans  leases and loans to state and political subdivisions 
the majority of these loans are installment loans with fixed interest rates 
installment and other loans were million at december   a decrease of million  or from million at december  installment and other loans have been decreasing as a percentage of total loans over the past several years as we have placed less emphasis in this area and more emphasis on our small to mid size business loans in our markets 
loan maturities the following tables present  at december  and  loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio based on contractual schedules 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are re evaluated using substantially the same credit procedures that are used when loans are made 
december  over one year through five years over five years one year or less fixed rate variable fixed rate variable total in thousands loans secured by real estate one to four family     construction and land development    commercial      other      total      commercial and agricultural     installment and other     gross loans     less unearned fees total loans receivable     december  over one year through five years over five years one year or less fixed rate variable fixed rate variable total in thousands loans secured by real estate one to four family     construction and land development    commercial      other       total      commercial and agricultural     installment and other     gross loans     less unearned fees total loans receivable     non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and restructured loans 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is days or more past due  or when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of a loan 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  the accrual of interest income is typically discontinued and any interest accrued to date is reversed through a charge to interest income  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
while a loan is on non accrual status  it is our policy that interest income is recognized only after payment in full of the past due principal 
however  in some instances  we will recognize interest on a cash basis for loans that are on non accrual when there is no doubt  in the opinion of management  that the interest and principal will be collected in full based on the collateral values and management s analysis of the collectibility of the loan 
the following table presents information concerning the non performing assets at the dates indicated 
december dollars in thousands non accrual loans      loans days past due and still accruing  restructured loans     non performing loans     other real estate owned  total non performing assets     non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing assets were million at december  compared to million at december   representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in non performing assets was due to a decrease in non performing loans of million  slightly offset by an increase in other real estate owned of  non performing loans decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in non performing loans was primarily the result of a decrease in non accrual loans of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a group of loans in our missouri market from a diversified commercial customer totaling million that were on non accrual status as of december  as of december   all loans with this customer were in good standing and continue to be through march   the date of this report 
also contributing to the decrease in non accrual loans were several other payoffs or significant reductions in loans that were on non accrual as of december  at december  our largest single loan relationship on non accrual was for approximately million  including  for a construction loan  secured by real estate  in our colorado market 
also included in the million of non accrual loans at december  were several smaller loan relationships  the largest of which was approximately  for a commercial loan 
non accrual loans had approximately  specific allocations included in the allowance for loan losses at december  we do not anticipate losses on these credits in excess of the specific allocations 
restructured loans at december  consisted of eight relationships 
the largest relationship included three agricultural loans for approximately  which were restructured through farm service agency and are therefore guaranteed 
in addition to the non accrual loans mentioned above  the company also has identified loans for which management has concerns about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms 
these loans are primarily classified as substandard or doubtful for regulatory purposes under the company s internal rating system 
the loans are generally secured by either real estate or other borrower assets  reducing the potential for loss should they become non performing 
although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans  they may never become non performing 
such loans totaled million at december  other real estate owned was  at december  compared to  at december  other real estate owned consisted of seven properties  consisting of five commercial buildings and two single family dwellings at december  the properties are all located within our market areas 
management is working to sell the real estate as soon as practicable 
during the year ended december   five properties held in other real estate owned were sold at a total net gain of approximately  non performing assets as a percent of total assets were at december   compared to at december  despite this decrease  management believes our loan portfolio may be adversely affected in future periods as a result of the current weakening economic conditions in our market areas 
the construction and land development portfolio is particularly susceptible and has recently shown additional weakness due to declining residential demand and the corresponding downward pressure on land and home prices as well as decreased real estate collateral values 
thus  increased provisions for loan losses may be incurred in future periods and net charge offs may increase as a result of the current conditions  although the magnitude of any increase in non performing loans is not determinable at this time 
non performing assets will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress  and management believes the level of non performing assets may increase if economic weaknesses in the company s lending areas  particularly relating to real estate loans  are experienced in impaired loans we consider a loan to be impaired when it is deemed probable by management that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
when determining whether a loan is impaired  management also considers the loan documentation  the current ratio of the loan s balance to collateral value  and the borrower s present financial position 
included as impaired loans are all loans contractually delinquent days or more  all loans upon which accrual of interest has been suspended and all restructured loans 
at december   we had impaired loans totaling million  which have related specific reserves of  this compares to million of impaired loans  which had related specific reserves of  at december  the decrease in impaired loans was the result of the decrease in non accrual loans described above 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million during and million during interest income recognized on impaired loans during the period the loans were considered to be impaired for and approximated  and  respectively 
there were million and million of loans on non accrual status as of december  and  respectively 
the interest income not recognized on these loans was  and  at december  and  respectively 
impaired loans will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of impaired loans could increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in our market area or in areas that we have participations during allowance for loan losses credit losses are inherent in the lending business 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality of the collateral of the loan 
management maintains our allowance for loan losses based on historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular review of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for probable loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we actively manage our past due and non performing loans in an effort to minimize credit losses and monitor asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes our allowance for loan losses is adequate  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses current information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income and capital and could result in an inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated

net charge offs for consisted of several credits 
the largest charge off during was approximately  for a commercial loan 
lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio 
additionally we have a separate loan review process  which reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine compliance with loan policy  including the appropriateness of risk ratings assigned to individual loans  as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based primarily on management s estimates of probable loan losses from the foregoing processes and historical experience 
management also provides additional allowance for loan losses based on current economic factors 
the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
the table has been derived in part by applying historical loan loss ratios to both internally classified loans and the portfolio as a whole to determine the allocation of the loan losses attributable to each category of loans

the company relies on various economic trend reports for the kansas city metropolitan market and the colorado springs metropolitan market 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to construction and land development increased approximately  at december  compared to december  due to an increase in the allocation of the allowance associated with historical trends and economic conditions for our markets 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and other loans secured by real estate increased  due to increases in the allowance based on historical trends for our markets compared to the prior year 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and agricultural loans decreased approximately  due to a decrease in specific allowance allocations of  offset by an increase in historic and economic reserves allocated to commercial and agriculture loans at december  compared to december  in  management increased the allowance associated with current economic conditions by a total of  in response to the weakened economic conditions in our markets  as well as generally volatile conditions in the broader economy 
investments we invest a portion of our available funds in short term and long term instruments  including federal funds sold and investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to provide liquidity for cash flow requirements  assist in managing interest rate risk and provide collateral for certain public deposits and other borrowing arrangements 
at december  and  the investment portfolio was comprised principally of mortgage backed securities  obligations of us government agencies and obligations of states and political subdivisions 
total investment securities at december  of million represented a decrease of million from total investment securities of million at december  the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in mortgage backed securities of million  the proceeds of which were used to fund the loan portfolio growth 
we initiated a long term balance sheet management strategy starting in the fourth quarter of to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet with the expectation of benefiting from an anticipated increase in interest rates and to borrow long term during the period of historically low interest rates 
under this strategy we borrowed million in federal home loan bank advances and purchased short term investment securities and funded loans 
the federal home loan bank borrowings  which carry an average rate of  upon origination consisted of million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to a range of to within the years  million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to within the years  million in year floating rate advances and million in year fixed rate advances 
as of december   we had outstanding balances of million on these federal home loan bank borrowings 
a decreasing interest rate environment may cause an unfavorable impact on net interest income and net interest margin and an increasing interest rate environment may increase net interest income and net interest margin over the remaining borrowing period

federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank borrowings our subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank of topeka fhlb 
the fhlb system functions as a central bank providing credit for members 
as members of the fhlb  our subsidiary banks are entitled to borrow funds from the fhlb and are required to own fhlb stock in an amount determined by a formula based upon total assets and fhlb borrowings 
our subsidiary banks may use fhlb borrowings to supplement deposits as a source of funds 
at december   fhlb borrowings aggregated million  compared to million at december  as discussed in the investment section above  approximately million of the fhlb borrowings are part of a long term balance sheet strategy to increase the sensitivity of our balance sheet by borrowing long term funds at historically low interest rates and purchasing short term investments securities and fund loans 
at december   the aggregate available and unused borrowing capacity of our subsidiary banks was approximately million  which was available through a line of credit and term advances 
fhlb borrowings are collateralized by fhlb common stock  investment securities and certain qualifying mortgage loans of our subsidiary banks 
teambank and colorado national bank are member banks of the federal reserve bank and may use the federal reserve bank discount window to meet short term funding needs 
neither of our subsidiary banks utilized short term federal reserve bank borrowings during or subordinated debentures on august   team financial capital trust i the trust  a delaware business trust formed by team financial  inc  completed the sale of million cumulative trust preferred securities 
the trust used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase a like amount of team financial  inc s subordinated debentures 
the debentures  maturing august   were the sole assets of the trust 
on or after august   we had the right to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  at a redemption price specified in the governing indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
on september   we redeemed all of the debentures and the trust redeemed its trust preferred securities  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the trust  or million  plus interest accrued and unpaid through september  as a result of the redemption  we incurred a pretax charge  recorded as trust preferred securities redemption amortization to earnings of approximately  on the redemption date of the debentures 
this charge was the unamortized portion of the offering cost that was being amortized over the original year life of the debentures 
to fund the redemption  on september  we replaced the prior existing debentures and the former trust with team financial capital trust ii  a pooled trust preferred security of million at a variable rate of above the day libor 
the new trust preferred securities have a year term maturing on october  and a call option years after the issuance date 
the new trust preferred securities did not have a placement or annual trustee fee associated with it 
in  interest expense was reduced by approximately  on the original million of trust preferred securities based on the reduction in interest rates 
total interest expense on the trust preferred securities increased in over prior years due to the additional million of trust preferred securities 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  adopted in december  the new trust qualifies as a special purpose entity that is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements 
we continue to include the new trust preferred securities issued by team financial capital trust ii in tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of business that are integral to our operations 
we have commitments to extend credit to our customers of approximately million at december  additionally  the contractual amount of standby letters of credit at december  was approximately million 
these commitments involve credit risk in excess of the amount stated in the consolidated balance sheet 
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
standby letters of credit are a conditional  but irrevocable form of guarantee issued to guarantee payment to a third party obligee upon default of payment by our customer 
standby letters of credit are initially issued for a period of one year  but can be extended depending on the customers needs 
as of december   the maximum remaining term for any standby letter of credit was october  since the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is the same as that involved in extending loans to customers  team financial  inc uses the same credit policies in evaluating the creditworthiness of the customers and determining the required collateral 
commitments for standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we have a data processing contract that contains minimum obligations 
under the terms of this contract as of december   we are committed to pay minimum payments of million over the remaining term of the contract 
additional payments may be required based on volume of transactions processed or conversion fees 
capital resources we actively monitor compliance with bank and financial holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credit  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  core capital and total capital  which consist of core and secondary capital 
historically  we have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
the primary source of funds available to us is dividends by our subsidiary banks 
each subsidiary bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory requirements 
core capital  also known as tier capital  generally includes common shareholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and intangible assets 
no more than of core capital elements may consist of cumulative preferred stock 
the trust preferred securities  issued by our subsidiary  team financial capital trust ii  to purchase team financial  inc subordinated debentures  is included in tier i capital of team financial  inc for regulatory purposes 
total risk based capital  also known as tier capital  generally includes the allowance for loan losses limited to of weighted risk assets  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as hybrid capital instruments

based on federal reserve board guidelines  a bank holding company generally is required to maintain a leverage ratio in excess of 
impact of inflation and changes in prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction  or have the same magnitude  as changes in the prices of goods and services
