overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our approximately member specialty sales and marketing team focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists  who are doctors who specialize in gastrointestinal diseases  to sell our products 
our current products demonstrate our ability to execute this strategy

we enter into distribution or licensing relationships outside the united states and in certain markets in the us where a larger sales organization is appropriate

we believe our sales force also should position us to sell additional products  if and when acquired and or approved for us marketing 
products xifaxan rifaximin tablets xifaxan is a gastrointestinal specific oral antibiotic that the fda approved in may for the treatment of patients years of age and older with travelers diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of e coli 
according to the centers for disease control  each year between and of international travelers  an estimated million people  develop diarrhea  with approximately of the cases caused by bacteria 
approximately million people sought treatment in the united states for infectious diarrhea in and approximately million of those patients were prescribed a drug 
we believe the advantages of xifaxan to treat these infections are two fold site targeted antibiotic delivery  and improved tolerability compared to other treatments 
less than of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream when it is taken orally 
in addition  the drug might also cause fewer side effects or discomforts such as nausea  headache or dizziness than observed with currently available  more highly absorbed antibiotics 
we believe xifaxan is also less likely to cause harmful interaction with other drugs a patient may be taking 
furthermore  we believe xifaxan is unique because there is no other us approved oral antibiotic with its potential lack of systemic absorption and safety profile 
we launched xifaxan in the united states in july using our own direct sales force 
we had net product sales of million  million  million and million of xifaxan in the united states in   and  respectively 
we are exploring potential additional indications  formulations  clinical trials and co promotion arrangements to capitalize on the potential for xifaxan  including our development programs in irritable bowel syndrome  hepatic encephalopathy  c 
difficile associated diarrhea  and prevention of travelers diarrhea 
based on these potential indications  we believe xifaxan can potentially compete in an annual us market in excess of approximately billion  comprised of over million patient visits 
while the potential market for xifaxan is large  we expect to capture only a portion of each market due to competition  market acceptance and or other factors 
the patents for the rifaximin composition of matter also covering a process of making rifaximin and using rifaximin to treat gastrointestinal infectious diseases expired in may in the united states and canada

people are most often diagnosed with the disease in their mid s  although the disease can occur at any age 
in clinical trials  colazal demonstrated at least comparable efficacy and had an improved safety profile as compared to some other oral asa products 
other asa products often do not deliver optimal doses of the active

the results of the study were highly statistically significant p with percent of xifaxan treated travelers remaining free from td versus percent of placebo treated travelers 
in our second phase iii trial to evaluate rifaximin in the prevention of td in travelers to thailand  the incidence rate at which international travelers to southern thailand acquired bacterial diarrhea was lower than the historical incidence rate 
consequently  due to the low incidence of travelers diarrhea  the study was unable to determine the utility of rifaximin in this particular study population 
we have a strong database of information from other travelers diarrhea prophylaxis trials  and we intend to meet with the fda to discuss these data and potential next steps

watson will pay salix a portion of its profits for sales under the agreement  and salix will supply watson with all its requirements for the product 
the agreement terminates in october  provided that either party may terminate immediately upon bankruptcy of the other  or for uncured breaches of the other party 
salix may also terminate on days notice if the agreement has become commercially unviable  if it obtains the right to prohibit other generics from being sold or if it ceases distribution of branded colazal 
manufacturing we own no manufacturing facilities 
we have in the past used and plan to continue to use third party manufacturers to produce material for use in clinical trials and for commercial product 
this manufacturing strategy enables us to direct our financial resources to product in licensing and acquisition  product development  and sales and marketing efforts  without devoting resources to the time and cost associated with building and maintaining manufacturing facilities 
currently  under long term supply agreements  we use balsalazide drug substance the active pharmaceutical ingredient in colazal capsules manufactured by omnichem sa  a subsidiary of ajinomoto in belgium  and pharmazell formerly noveon pharma  gmbh in raubling  germany 
also  under long term supply agreements  balsalazide is encapsulated into colazal drug product for us by nexgen pharma  inc 
formerly anabolic laboratories in irvine  california 
bulk colazal capsules are packaged into finished colazal commercial bottles by nexgen and carton service in norris  tennessee 
under our supply agreement with alfa wassermann  alfa wassermann is obligated to supply us with bulk rifaximin drug substance the active pharmaceutical ingredient in xifaxan tablets until july or introduction of a generic product  whichever occurs first 
our supply of rifaximin drug substance is manufactured by zach systems formerly zambon in lonigo  italy  and aventis in brindisi  italy 
under a long term supply agreement  rifaximin is converted into xifaxan drug product for us by patheon  inc in whitby  ontario

index to financial statements with respect to our products currently under development  namely our encapsulated granulated mesalamine  our mg balsalazide tablet formulation and our mg rifaximin tablet formulation  we plan to negotiate commercial supply agreements with the same manufacturers who supplied the drug substance and drug product for the supplies of the phase iii clinical trial material 
sales and marketing we currently market our products and intend  if approved by the fda  to market future products to us gastroenterologists through our own direct sales force 
we enter into distribution relationships outside the united states and in markets where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
currently  our sales and marketing staff consists of approximately people  which we believe should also position us to sell additional products  if and when acquired and or approved for us marketing 
because there is a relatively small number of gastroenterologists that write a majority of the prescriptions in our indications  we believe that the size of our sales force  is appropriate to reach our target physicians 
our sales force consists of ninety six employees who regularly call on approximately  gastroenterologists 
we also have nine national account managers who regularly call on major drug wholesalers  managed care organizations  large retail chains  formularies and related organizations 
we believe we have created an attractive incentive program for our sales force that is based upon goals in prescription growth  market share achievement and customer service 
we cultivate relationships of trust and confidence with the high prescribing gastroenterologists in the united states 
we use a variety of marketing techniques to promote our products including sampling  journal advertising  promotional materials  specialty publications  coupons  money back or product replacement guarantees  educational conferences and informational websites 
patents and proprietary rights general the patents for the balsalazide composition of matter and method of treating ulcerative colitis with balsalazide expired in july in the united states  however  we were granted five years of new chemical entity data exclusivity for balsalazide until july and an extension of such patent under the waxman hatch act through july we also obtained patent extensions for the composition of balsalazide in italy and the united kingdom until july we have filed applications for patents relating to additional indications using balsalazide and related chemical substances 
the patents for the rifaximin composition of matter also covering a process of making rifaximin and using rifaximin to treat gastrointestinal infectious diseases expired in may in the united states and canada 
in may  a us patent composition of matter and process patent that covers several physical states of rifaximin was issued that extends the patent coverage of the currently marketed form of rifaximin to may  alfa wasserman spa  the patent owner  has licensed rights to rifaximin in the united states to salix 
in july  salix entered into an agreement with cedars sinai medical center for the right to use its patent and patent application relating to methods of diagnosis and treating irritable bowel syndrome and other disorders caused by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 
the patent for the treatment of the intestinal tract with the granulated mesalamine product provides patent coverage to the patent for balsalazide mg tablets provides patent coverage to the patent for visicol provides patent coverage to the patent for osmoprep provides patent coverage to additional patent protection is being sought on osmoprep that  if approved  will provide patent coverage to the patent for moviprep provides patent coverage to this patent was issued by the uspto in january and it contains composition of matter and kit claims

index to financial statements the patent for sanvar expired in  however  we will be applying for patent term restoration 
data exclusivity rifaximin is a new chemical entity  therefore  the fda granted us five year new chemical entity exclusivity when it was approved in may therefore  rifaximin has data exclusivity through may although the granulated mesalamine product is not a new chemical entity  it may be entitled to three years of exclusivity from the date of its approval based on the new clinical investigations that have been required during the approval process 
such exclusivity would have the effect of preventing the fda from approving an nda for a granulated mesalamine product which relied upon the new clinical investigation in our nda for three years from the date of approval 
the patent for the granulated mesalamine protects the product until sanvar is an orphan drug  therefore  the product will be entitled to orphan exclusivity for seven years beginning from the date of the approval of our nda 
azasan and the anusol hc and proctocort product lines are mature products  thus  there are no available patent or exclusivity rights 
government regulation the research  testing  manufacture  marketing and distribution of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  storage  record keeping  labeling  promotion and marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to administrative sanctions or judicially imposed sanctions such as civil penalties  criminal prosecution  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  and total or partial suspension of product marketing and or approvals 
in addition  non compliance may result in the fda s refusal to approve pending ndas or supplements to approved ndas or in the withdrawal of an nda 
any such sanction could result in adverse publicity  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions  and results of operation 
the steps ordinarily required before a new pharmaceutical product containing a new chemical entity may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals and formulation studies  the submission to the fda of a notice of claimed investigational exemption for a new drug or antibiotic  which must become effective before clinical testing may commence  adequate and well controlled clinical human trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of an nda to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
a day waiting period after the filing of each ind is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
in addition  the fda may  at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials 
if the fda imposes a clinical hold  clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda 
in some instances  the ind application process can result in substantial delay and expense 
clinical trials to support ndas are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements phase ii evaluations  phase iii trials are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  with respect to any of our products subject to such testing 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  generally an nda is submitted 
fda approval of the nda is required before marketing may begin in the united states 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
in such an event  the nda must be resubmitted with the additional information and  again  is subject to review before filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
the fda generally has months in which to review the nda and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
if the fda s evaluation of the nda submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda may refuse to approve the nda or issue a not approvable letter  outlining the deficiencies in the submission and often requiring additional testing or information 
if fda evaluations of the nda and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
when and if those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
furthermore  approval may entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies  and marketed products  manufacturers and manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
in addition  identification of certain side effects after a drug is on the market or the occurrence of manufacturing problems could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials and changes in labeling of the product 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than  individuals in the united states or a disease whose incidence rates number more than  where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs 
the sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years 
vapreotide acetate  rifaximin for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and colazal for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients between to years of age have been granted orphan drug status 
regulation of drug compounds outside of the united states outside the united states  the ability to market a drug is contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
currently  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although within the european union procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
if and when necessary  we will choose the appropriate route of european regulatory filing to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals 
however  the chosen regulatory strategy might not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of our chosen product indications 
furthermore  we must obtain pricing approval in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching the product in the approving country 
failure to obtain pricing approval in a timely manner or approval of pricing which would support an adequate return on investment or generate a sufficient margin to justify the economic risk might delay or prohibit the commercial launch of the product in those countries 
competition competition in our business is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress

index to financial statements or superior marketing capabilities possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
we believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including large well known pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic research groups throughout the world  engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at gastrointestinal diseases and conditions addressed by our current and potential products 
in particular  we are aware of products in research or development by competitors that address the diseases being targeted by our products 
developments by others might render our current and potential products obsolete or non competitive 
competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and  therefore  market their products earlier than us 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities than we do 
for example  many large  well capitalized companies already offer products in the united states and europe that target the indications for balsalazide  including mesalamine and the granulated mesalamine product glaxosmithkline plc  giuliani spa  axcan pharma  inc  solvay sa  the procter gamble company and shire pharmaceuticals group plc  sulfasalazine pharmacia upjohn  inc  and olsalazine pharmacia upjohn  inc 
asacol  marketed by proctor gamble  is currently the most prescribed product for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in the united states  and shire recently introduced once a day lialda 
in addition  on december   the office of generic drugs approved three generic balsalazide capsule products 
several prescription  liquid peg products compete with visicol  osmoprep and moviprep in the bowel cleansing market 
these prescription products include colyte  golytely  halflytely  and nulytely braintree and trilyte schwarz pharma 
generic prescription  liquid peg products are also available 
an over the counter product  fleets phospho soda  also competes in the bowel cleansing market 
the most frequently prescribed product for treatment of travelers diarrhea in the united states currently is ciprofloxacin  commonly known as cipro and marketed by bayer ag 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with azasan are imuran  marketed by prometheus laboratories  inc  and its various generics and purinethol  marketed by gate pharmaceuticals  and it s various generics 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with anusol hc and proctocort are anamantle hc  marketed by bradley pharmaceuticals  analpram hc  marketed by ferndale laboratories  proctofoam hc and proctocream hc  marketed by schwartz pharma  procto kit  marketed by ranbaxy pharmaceuticals  and various generics 
employees as of december   we had approximately full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract  hire  and retain qualified personnel  including sales and marketing personnel in particular 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  attract  and retain such personnel in the future 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference 
if any of the following risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant  develop into actual events  then our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline  and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment 
future sales of colazal will be significantly less than historical sales due to the approval of three generic competitors 
historically we have derived a majority of our revenue from sales of colazal 
on december   the office of generic drugs  or ogd  approved three generic balsalazide capsule products  and we announced that we had 
table of contents 
index to financial statements entered into an agreement with watson pharma  inc to market and sell an authorized generic of colazal 
watson will pay salix a portion of its profits for sales under the agreement  and salix will supply watson with all its requirements for the product 
the price competition among the generic firms has resulted in dramatic price erosion compared to pricing prior to the generic approvals  and we expect that the market share that watson obtains will be significantly less profitable than colazal s previous market share 
in addition  we have implemented various programs in that attempt to reduce the market share lost to the generic products  however these programs will reduce the profitability of colazal sales in and thereafter 
as a result  we expect the future sales of colazal to be significantly less than historical sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reserve which is our estimate of colazal previously sold to wholesalers that may be returned to us under our return policy as a result of these generic approvals  based on data currently available to us 
since we have limited experience on the actual effect that the generics will have on colazal demand  this estimate could be adjusted higher or lower in future periods based on actual returns 
the combined effect of colazal s reduction in market share  the price erosion in the asa market and the limited expected contribution from watson s share of the generic market will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  it is possible that additional generics could be approved  further increasing competition and pricing pressure 
we expect to be unprofitable and experience negative cash flow during  and we may need additional capital 
due to the generic approvals discussed above  we will be unprofitable and have negative cash flow during we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from the sale of our products will be sufficient to fund our operations for our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to patient and physician demand for our products  the status of competitive products  including current and potential generics  the results  costs and timing of our research and development activities  regulatory approvals and product launches  our ability to reduce our costs in the event product demand is less than expected  or regulatory approvals are delayed or more expensive than expected  the number of products we acquire or in license  the actual amount of colazal returns we receive compared to our current estimates  and our ability to maintain our current credit facility 
we believe that we will be able to return to a positive cash flow position without requiring additional capital based on our current projections 
however these projections may change due to changes in the factors discussed above  or other factors 
if we need additional capital  we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or acquisitions 
if we incur more debt  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
if we issued additional equity  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we might also enter into additional collaborative arrangements that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone and or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
our common stock is likely to decrease in value if the market believes that we will be unable to return to profitability  or that we will be required to raise additional capital 
our credit facility contains various representations  warranties and affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type 
the financial covenants include a leverage test and a fixed charge test 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  however  based on our current projections for  we could fall out of compliance with the financial covenants at some point during  unless we obtain a waiver or amend the facility  which we are discussing with the lender 
in the event a waiver or amendment is not obtained  the million currently outstanding on the credit facility would be immediately due if one or more of the covenants are violated

index to financial statements future sales of xifaxan and our other marketed products might be less than expected 
we currently market and sell nine primary products  with a majority of our historical revenue derived from sales of colazal 
we expect xifaxan  which was launched in mid  osmoprep  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of inkine in september  and moviprep  which we acquired from norgine in december  to be growing and significant sources of revenue in the future 
if sales of our marketed products decline or if we experience product returns significantly in excess of estimated amounts recorded  particularly with respect to xifaxan  osmoprep and moviprep  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the degree of market acceptance of our products among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community will depend upon a number of factors including the timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors  such as the launch of lialda  and including any generic or over the counter competitors  perceptions by physicians and other members of the healthcare community regarding the safety and efficacy of the products  price increases  and the price of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments  patient and physician demand  adverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or other drugs in our class  the results of product development efforts for new indications  the scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and favorable reimbursement programs for expanded uses  availability of sufficient commercial quantities of the products  and our success in getting other companies to distribute our products outside of the us gastroenterology market 
our ability to increase revenue in the future will depend in part on our success in in licensing or acquiring additional pharmaceutical products 
we currently intend to in license or acquire pharmaceutical products  like vapreotide acetate  that have been developed beyond the initial discovery phase and for which late stage human clinical data is already available  or like pepcid oral suspension  that have already received regulatory approval 
these kinds of pharmaceutical products might not be available to us on attractive terms or at all 
to the extent we acquire rights to additional products  we might incur significant additional expense in connection with the development and  if approved by the fda  marketing of these products 
in addition  our license agreement with alfa wassermann provides that we may not promote  distribute or sell any antibiotic product that competes with xifaxan in the united states and canada until mid  thereby limiting our ability to acquire  develop or market other antibiotic products 
regulatory approval of our product candidates is time consuming  expensive and uncertain  and could result in unexpectedly high expenses and delay our ability to sell our products 
development of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this regulation could require us to incur significant unexpected expenses or delay or limit our ability to sell our product candidates  including specifically granulated mesalamine  metoclopramide zydis and balsalazide disodium tablets  our product candidates that are farthest along in the regulatory approval process 
as an example  fda approval of moviprep was delayed from may until august to resolve regulatory issues  and in early  the fda announced that because of its large workload it might not meet its target dates to respond to nda submissions 
our clinical studies might be delayed or halted  or additional studies might be required  for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  
table of contents 
index to financial statements appropriate patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate expected  as has been the case with our xifaxan phase iii trial in thailand for the prevention of travelers diarrhea  drug supplies are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  or we decide to modify the drug during testing 
if regulatory approval of any product is granted  it will be limited to those indications for which the product has been shown to be safe and effective  as demonstrated to the fda s satisfaction through clinical studies 
we are developing granulated mesalamine and balsalazide disodium tablets as treatments for ulcerative colitis and vapreotide acetate as a treatment for acute esophageal variceal bleeding  as well as studying xifaxan for other indications 
the fda may never approve these compounds in these indications  which would mean we cannot market these compounds for use in these indications 
regulatory approval  even if granted  might entail ongoing requirements or restrictions on marketing that could increase our expenses and limit revenue 
approval might entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies  or limit how or to whom we can sell our products 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  such as with colazal  xifaxan visicol  osmoprep  and moviprep  labeling and promotional activities are subject to continual scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them might increase our expenses  impair our ability to effectively market our products  and limit our revenue 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulation could harm us financially and could hurt our reputation 
we and our third party manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our products  and they are subject to additional fda inspection 
manufacturing regulations can increase our expenses and delay production  either of which could reduce our margins 
in addition  if we fail to comply with any of the fda s continuing regulations  we could be subject to reputational harm and sanctions  including delays  warning letters and fines  product recalls or seizures and injunctions on sales  refusal of the fda to review pending applications  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
in addition  the occurrence of manufacturing problems could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional testing or changes in labeling of the product 
our intellectual property rights might not afford us with meaningful protection 
the intellectual property rights protecting our products might not afford us with meaningful protection from generic and other competition 
in addition  because our strategy is to in license or acquire pharmaceutical products which typically have been discovered and initially researched by others  future products might have limited or no remaining patent protection due to the time elapsed since their discovery 
competitors could also design around any of our intellectual property or otherwise design competitive products that do not infringe our intellectual property 
any litigation that we become involved in to enforce intellectual property rights could result in substantial cost to us 
in addition  claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could be costly 
our patent or other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements proprietary rights related to our products might conflict with the current or future intellectual property rights of others 
litigation or patent interference proceedings  either of which could result in substantial cost to us  might be necessary to defend any patents to which we have rights and our other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
the defense of patent and intellectual property claims is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable 
any adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require us to cease selling one or more of our products 
we might not be able to obtain a license to any third party technology that we require to conduct our business  or  if obtainable  that technology might not be available at a reasonable cost 
upon patent expiration  our drugs could be subject to generic competition  which could negatively affect our pricing and sales volume 
as noted above in future sales of colazal will be significantly less than historical sales due to the approval of three generic competitors  this has already happened to balsalazide capsules 
patent applications relating to rifaxamin compositions and related chemical substances were filed together with alfa wasserman and issued in may this patent extends patent coverage to in january  the united states patent and trademark office issued a patent covering composition of matter and kit claims for moviprep 
the moviprep patent provides coverage to september the patent for visicol and osmoprep will expire in additional patent protection is being sought for osmoprep that  if approved  will provide patent coverage to the patent for the treatment of the intestinal tract with the granulated mesalamine product will provide patent coverage to the patent for sanvar expired in  however  we will be applying for patent term restoration 
there is no assurance that these patents or the patent term restoration will be issued or granted  respectively 
patent expiration dates listed herein  unless otherwise noted  are for us patents and assume there are no patent term adjustments  extensions or other adverse events that could affect the term or scope of a patent 
rifaximin is a new chemical entity and was granted a five year new chemical entity exclusivity by the fda when it was approved in may rifaximin  therefore  has data exclusivity to may similarly  sanvar is a new chemical entity and will be entitled to data exclusivity for five years beginning from the date of the approval of our nda 
in june and september we submitted additional supplements to our citizen petition originally filed in april  requesting the director of the office of generic drugs of the food and drug administration adopt guidance applicable to orally administered  locally acting gastrointestinal drug products prior to approval of any generic versions of such drugs 
the fda rejected our citizens petition and all supplemental filings in december  allowing the three generic versions of balsalazide capsules to be approved and making additional generic versions of our products easier to approve that we had hoped 
because azasan  anusol hc and proctocort are mature products there are no patents or data exclusivity rights available  which subjects us to greater risk of generic competition for those products 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
these agreements might be breached and we might not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets and proprietary know how might otherwise become known or be independently developed by others 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
we might be subjected to product liability claims that arise through the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
although we currently maintain liability coverage for both clinical trials and the commercialization of our products  it is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to satisfy any liabilities that may arise 
in the future  we might not be able to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or might be unable to obtain adequate coverage at all

in addition  other products are in research or development by competitors that address the diseases and diagnostic procedures being targeted by these and our other products 
if third party payors do not provide coverage or reimburse patients for our products  our ability to derive revenues will suffer 
our success will depend in part on the extent to which government and health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors will pay for our products 
reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products is uncertain 
in the united states and elsewhere  third party payors  such as medicaid  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products 
in the united states  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system have been proposed in recent years 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
while we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or what effect those proposals or managed care efforts  including those relating to medicaid payments  might have on our business  the announcement and or adoption of such proposals or efforts could increase costs and reduce or eliminate profit margins 
third party insurance coverage might not be available to patients for our products 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  the market acceptance of these products might be reduced 
we are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products 
we have limited experience and capabilities in manufacturing pharmaceutical products 
we do not generally expect to engage directly in the manufacturing of products  but instead contract with others for these services 
a limited number of manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our marketed products and our product candidates 
we might fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or might contract with manufacturers on terms that may not be entirely acceptable to us 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacture of products might be difficult to scale up when required and result in delays  inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products  
table of contents 
index to financial statements some of our contracts contain purchase commitments that require us to make minimum purchases that might exceed needs or limit the ability to negotiate with other manufacturers  which might increase costs  the cost of manufacturing certain products might make them prohibitively expensive  delays in scale up to commercial quantities and any change in manufacturers could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  manufacturers are subject to the fda s cgmp regulations and similar foreign standards  and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by the third party manufacturers  and if we need to change manufacturers  fda and comparable foreign regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections and the new manufacturers would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the production of our products 
our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period  and a failure to meet the expectations of investors or the financial community at large could result in a decline in our stock price 
our results of operations might fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis due to  among other factors the timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors  including potential generic or over the counter competitors  the level of revenue generated by commercialized products  including potential increased purchases of inventory by wholesalers in anticipation of potential price increases or introductions of new dosages or bottle sizes  and subsequent lower than expected revenue as the inventory is used  the timing of any up front payments that might be required in connection with any future acquisition of product rights  the timing of milestone payments that might be required to our current or future licensors  fluctuations in our development and other costs in connection with ongoing product development programs  the level of marketing and other expenses required in connection with product launches and ongoing product growth  the timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses  assets  products and technologies  and general and industry specific business and economic conditions

in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have in the past been and can in the future be expected to be especially volatile 
announcements of prescription trends  technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  generic approvals  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or our competitors  regulatory developments in both the united states and other countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products  and economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations in financial results  might have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
antitakeover provisions could discourage a takeover that stockholders consider to be in their best interests or prevent the removal of our current directors and management 
we have adopted a number of provisions that could have antitakeover effects or prevent the removal of our current directors and management 
we have adopted a stockholder protection rights plan  commonly referred to as a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements poison pill 
the rights plan is intended to deter an attempt to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights plan will not prevent an acquisition that is approved by our board of directors 
we believe our rights plan assisted in our successful defense against a hostile takeover bid earlier in our charter authorizes our board of directors to determine the terms of up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and issue them without stockholder approval 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from acquiring  voting control in order to remove our current directors and management 
our bylaws also eliminate the ability of the stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting or make proposals at stockholder meetings without giving us advance written notice  which could hinder the ability of stockholders to quickly take action that might be opposed by management 
these provisions could make more difficult the removal of current directors and management or a takeover of salix  even if these events could be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our member specialty sales and marketing team focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists to sell our products 
our current products demonstrate our ability to execute this strategy 
as of december   our primary products were xifaxan rifaximin tablets mg  osmoprep sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  moviprep peg  sodium sulfate  sodium chloride  potassium chloride  sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid for oral solution  colazal balsalazide disodium capsules mg  visicol sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp  and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  azasan azathioprine tablets  usp  mg  anusol hc hydrocortisone cream  usp  anusol hc mg suppository hydrocortisone acetate  proctocort cream hydrocortisone cream  usp and proctocort suppository hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories mg  pepcid famotidine for oral suspension  and oral suspension diuril chlorothiazide 
we currently market our products  and intend  if approved by the fda  to market future products to us gastroenterologists through our own direct sales force 
we enter into distribution relationships outside the united states and in certain markets in the us where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
currently  our sales and marketing staff consists of approximately people 
we generate revenue primarily by selling our products  namely prescription drugs  to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
these direct customers resell and distribute our products to and through pharmacies to patients who have had our products prescribed by doctors 
because demand for our products originates with doctors  our sales force calls on high prescribing specialists  primarily gastroenterologists  and we monitor new and total prescriptions for our products as key performance indicators for our business 
prescriptions result in our products being used by patients  requiring our direct customers to purchase more products to replenish their inventory 
however  our revenue might fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to other factors  such as increased buying by wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase or because of the introduction of new products 
revenue could be less than anticipated in subsequent quarters as wholesalers increased inventory is used up 
for example  wholesalers made initial stocking purchases of osmoprep when it was launched in second quarter and moviprep when it was launched in the third quarter of also  colazal revenue was slightly lower than in the comparable periods in even though prescriptions increased in

index to financial statements in december  we established our own field sales force to market colazal in the united states 
currently  this sales force has approximately sales representatives in the field 
although the creation of an independent sales organization involved substantial costs  we believe that the financial returns from our direct product sales have been and will continue to be more favorable to us than those from the indirect sale of products through marketing partners 
in addition  we intend to enter into distribution relationships outside the united states and in markets where a larger sales organization is appropriate

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales of our products  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and legal issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results might differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates  as well as the related disclosures  have been reviewed by and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
together  sab  and fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
sab states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
sfas states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of sale  the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize revenues for product sales at the time title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  and the other criteria of sab and sfas are satisfied  which is generally at the time products are shipped 
our net product revenue represents our total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  and product returns 
we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by salix and or its competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we use prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel which may be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
at least quarterly for each product line  we prepare an internal estimate of ending inventory units in the distribution channel by adding estimated inventory in the channel at the beginning of the period  plus net product shipments for the period  less estimated prescriptions written for the period 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel that might be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
this is done for each product line by applying a rate of historical activity for rebates  chargebacks and product returns  adjusted for relevant quantitative and qualitative factors discussed above  to the potential exposed product estimated to be in the distribution channel 
internal forecasts that are utilized to calculate the estimated number of months in the channel are regularly adjusted based on input from members of our sales  marketing and operations groups 
the adjusted forecasts take into account numerous factors including  but not limited to  new product introductions  direct communication with customers and potential product expiry issues 
consistent with industry practice  we periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customer base 
these discounts are calculated as a percentage of the current published list price and are treated as off invoice allowances 
accordingly  the discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
in addition to promotional discounts  at the time that we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customer base an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon shipment and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 
allowances for estimated rebates and chargebacks were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various 
table of contents 
index to financial statements governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts and chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a methodology of applying the relevant quantitative and qualitative assumptions discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for rebates and chargebacks  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology continues to be appropriate

resulted in an additional percentage point change in the trailing average of estimated chargeback and rebate activity in  we would have recorded an adjustment to revenues of approximately million  or  for the year 
allowances for product returns were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for product that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy 
the balance at december  includes the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of reflecting our estimate of colazal that may be returned to us under our return policy as a result of the approval of three generic balsalazide capsule products by the office of generic drugs on december  we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on historical return rates  the estimated inventory in the channel  and the other factors discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for product returns  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology is still reasonable 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in forecasted return rates for all products other than colazal would have resulted in a change in total product returns liability at december  of approximately million and a corresponding change in net product revenue of less than 
colazal  our balsalazide disodium capsule  has historically accounted for a majority of the company s revenue 
on december   the office of generic drugs  or ogd  approved three generic balsalazide capsule products 
as a result of these generic approvals  the company expects the future sales of colazal to be significantly less than historical sales of colazal 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million reserve which is an estimate of the company s liability for colazal that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with the company s stated return policy as a result of these generic approvals 
this estimate was developed based on the following estimates our estimate of the quantity and expiration dates of colazal inventory in the distribution channel based on historical net product shipments less estimated historical prescriptions written  our estimate of future demand for colazal based on the actual erosion of product demand for several comparable products that were previously genericized  and the most recent demand for colazal prior to the generic approvals  the actual demand for colazal experienced during subsequent to the generic approvals  our estimate of potential cannibalization of colazal demand by our mg balsalazide tablet which we expect to launch during if approved by the fda  our estimate of the generic market that will be obtained by watson  and other factors 
due to the subjectivity of this estimate  the company prepares various sensitivity analyses to ensure the company s final estimate is within a reasonable range 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in the quantity of colazal inventory in the distribution channel would have resulted in a change in the colazal return reserve of approximately million and a corresponding change in net product revenue of approximately 
a change in assumptions that resulted in a change in the estimated future demand of colazal would have resulted in a change in the colazal return reserve of approximately million and a corresponding change in net product revenue of approximately

intangible assets and goodwill the company s intangible assets consist of license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  which result from product and business acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
when the company makes product acquisitions that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  it records the purchase price of such intangibles  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
the company allocates the aggregate purchase price to the fair value of the various tangible and intangible assets in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the acquired assets and then amortizes the cost of the intangible assets as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
the company believes the following factors could trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  the company must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
