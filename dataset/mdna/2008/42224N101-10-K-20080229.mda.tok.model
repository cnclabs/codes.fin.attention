for purposes of comparing our twelve month results with the comparable and periods  we have combined the results of operations of the predecessor from january  through february  and of the company for the period from march  through december  this combined presentation is not in accordance with gaap  however  we believe it is useful in analyzing and comparing certain of our operating trends for the last three fiscal years 
the combined and consolidated results of operations include the accounts of healthspring  inc and all of its subsidiaries 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue general 
our revenue consists primarily of i premium revenue we generate from our medicare and commercial lines of business  ii fee revenue we receive for management and administrative services provided to independent physician associations  health plans  and self insured employers  and for access to our provider networks  and iii investment income 
premium revenue 
our medicare and commercial lines of business include all premium revenue we receive in our health plans 
our medicare contracts entitle us to premium payments from cms  on behalf of each medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans  generally on a per member per month  or pmpm  basis 
in our commercial hmos  we receive a monthly payment from or on behalf of each enrolled member 
in both our commercial and medicare plans  we recognize premium revenue during the month in which the company is obligated to provide services to an enrolled member 
premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as deferred revenue 
premiums for our medicare and commercial products are generally fixed by contract in advance of the period during which health care is covered 
each of our medicare plans submits rate proposals to cms  generally by county or service area  in june for each medicare product that will be offered beginning january of the subsequent year 
retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to each of our medicare plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan populations 
for a further explanation of the company s accounting for retroactive risk payments  see risk adjustment payments section below 
our commercial premium rates are generally fixed for the plan year  in most cases beginning january as with our traditional medicare advantage plans  we provide written bids to cms for our part d plans  which include the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
premium payments from cms are based on these estimated costs 
the amount of cms payments relating to the part d standard coverage for our ma pd and pdp plan is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare our prescription drug costs in our bids to cms to our actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or our refunding to cms a portion of the premium payments we previously received 
we estimate and recognize adjustments to premium revenue related to estimated risk corridor payments as of each quarter end based upon our actual prescription drug costs for each reporting period as if the annual contract were to end at the end of each reporting period 
we account for estimated risk corridor settlements with cms on our balance sheet and as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows 
actual risk corridor payments upon final settlement with cms could differ materially  favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates 
because of the part d product benefit design  the company incurs prescription drug costs unevenly throughout the year  resulting in fluctuations in quarterly ma pd and pdp earnings 
as a result of product features such as co payments and deductibles  the coverage gap  risk corridors  and reinsurance  we incur a disproportionate amount of prescription drug costs in the first half of the year 
as a result  our part d related earnings increase in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year 
certain part d related payments we receive from cms represent payments for claims that we pay on behalf of cms for which we assume no risk 
we account for these payments as funds held for the benefit of members on our balance sheet and as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows 
we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these payments as these amounts represent pass through payments from cms to fund deductibles  co payments  and other member benefits 

table of contents we recognize prescription drug costs as incurred  net of rebates from drug companies 
fee revenue 
fee revenue primarily includes amounts paid to us for management services provided to independent physician associations and health plans 
our management subsidiaries typically generate fee revenue on one of three bases as a percentage of revenue collected by the relevant health plan  as a fixed pmpm payment or percentage of revenue for members serviced by the relevant independent physician association  or as fees we receive for offering access to our provider networks and for administrative services we offer to self insured employers 
fee revenue is recognized in the month in which services are provided 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our management agreements with independent physician associations  or ipa s  we receive fees based on a share of the profits of the independent physician associations 
to the extent these fees relate to members of our hmo subsidiaries  the fees are recognized as a credit to medical expense 
management fees calculated based on profits are recognized  as fee revenue or as a credit to medical expenses  if applicable  when we can readily determine that such fees have been earned  which determination is typically made on a monthly basis 
investment income 
investment income consists of interest income and gross realized gains and losses from sales of available for sale investments and discount amortization and interest on held to maturity securities 
medical expense our largest expense is the cost of medical services we arrange for our members  or medical expense 
medical expense for our medicare and commercial plans primarily consist of payments to physicians  hospitals  pharmacies  and other health care providers for services and products provided to our medicare and commercial members 
we generally pay our providers on one of three bases fee for service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules  capitated arrangements  generally on a fixed pmpm payment basis  whereby the provider generally assumes some or all of the medical expense risk  and risk sharing arrangements  whereby we advance a capitated pmpm amount and share the risk of the medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre determined sharing ratios 
pharmacy cost represents payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective manufacturers 
one of our primary tools for managing our business and measuring our profitability is our medical loss ratio  or mlr  the ratio of our medical expenses to the premiums we receive 
relatively small changes in the ratio of our medical expenses relative to the premium we receive can result in significant changes in our financial results 
changes in the mlr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicare funding or commercial premiums  changes in benefits offered by our plans  our ability to manage medical expense  changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims  and our part d related earnings relative to cms risk corridors 
we use mlrs both to monitor our management of medical expenses and to make various business decisions  including what plans or benefits to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit  and our selection of healthcare providers 
we analyze and evaluate our medicare advantage  pdp and commercial mlrs separately

commercial membership has declined since as a result of the non renewal by employers in tennessee and alabama 
medicare advantage 
our medicare advantage membership increased by to  members at december  as compared to  members at december  the increase was principally attributable to the addition of  members as a result of the acquisition of lmc health plans and to organic growth in membership in our existing core markets through increased penetration in existing service areas 
medicare advantage including ma pd membership as of january  was  reflecting decreases in two of our markets as a result of exiting certain poorer performing counties and discontinuing certain product offerings 
stand alone pdp 
stand alone pdp membership increased by to  at december  as compared to  members at december  the increase was principally attributable to additional auto assignment by cms of membership

effective january   we began operations as a national pdp plan 
pdp membership as of january  was approximately  as a result of an additional auto assignment by cms of membership in the california and new york regions effective as of the start of the year 
we expect monthly increases to pdp membership throughout as a result of additional auto assignments from cms 
we do not actively market our pdp and have relied for membership on cms auto assignments of dual eligible beneficiaries 
commercial 
our commercial hmo membership declined from  members at december  to  members at december   or by  primarily as a result of the non renewal by employers in alabama and tennessee 
total commercial membership as of january  was  risk adjustment payments our medicare premium revenue is subject to adjustment based on the health risk of our members under cms s risk adjustment payment methodology 
under the risk adjustment payment methodology  managed care plans must capture  collect  and report diagnosis code information to cms 
after 
table of contents reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive risk premium adjustment for a given fiscal year generally occurs during the third quarter of such fiscal year 
this initial settlement the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on the prior year s dates of service 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk premium adjustment settlement for the fiscal year in the following year the final cms settlement 
during  we were unable to estimate the impact of either of these risk adjustment settlements  and as such recorded them upon notification from cms of such amounts 
in the first quarter of  we began estimating and recording on a monthly basis the initial cms settlement  as we concluded we had the ability to reasonably estimate such amounts 
similarly in the fourth quarter of the company accrued for the estimated final cms settlement as such amount was reasonably estimable 
the final cms settlement for was recorded during the second quarter of when payment notification was received from cms 
as of january  we will estimate and record on a monthly basis both the initial cms settlement and the final cms settlement for the cms plan year 
all such estimated amounts are periodically updated as necessary as additional diagnoses code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or we receive notification from cms of such settlement amounts 
the following schedule includes premiums  medical costs  and medical loss ratio statistics as adjusted for the following items adjustments to reflect in the final risk adjustment payment from cms of million and the related risk sharing costs  which were recorded in results

the main drivers of the current year decrease in cash provided from operations were a million use of cash related to the timing of settlements and receipts of part d funds with cms  a million negative variance in the timing of pharmacy claims payments and the run out in commercial claims on commercial plans that terminated during  and a negative variance in the timing of income tax payments 
compared with the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the combined twelve months ended december  is primarily attributable to increases in earnings and from favorable cash flows as a result of our entering the part d business as of january  in addition  the following working capital items had a significant impact on cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  risk corridor payable to cms associated with the part d drug program increased million in medical claims liability increased million in the current year as a result of the increase in medicare advantage including ma pd member months

proceeds from the million in term loans  together with the our available cash on hand  were used to fund the acquisition of lmc health plans see overview acquisition of leon medical centers health plans and transaction expenses related thereto 
the million revolving credit facility  which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions  was undrawn as of the date of this report

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded if and when better information becomes available 
actual results could significantly differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
medical expense and medical claims liability medical expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical expense that has been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
medical expense includes claim payments  capitation payments  and pharmacy costs  net of rebates  as well as estimates of future payments of claims incurred  net of reinsurance 
capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members 
pharmacy costs represent payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective vendors 
premiums we pay to reinsurers are reported as medical expenses and related reinsurance recoveries are reported as deductions from medical expenses 
medical claims liability includes medical claims reported to the plans but not yet paid as well as an actuarially determined estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plans 
the following table presents the components of our medical claims liability as of the dates indicated december  in thousands incurred but not reported ibnr reported claims total medical claims liability the ibnr component of total medical claims liability is based on our historical claims data  current enrollment  health service utilization statistics  and other related information 
estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  it represents our most critical accounting estimate 
changes 
table of contents in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our consolidated operating results and overall financial position 
our policy is to record each plan s best estimate of medical expense ibnr 
using actuarial models  we calculate a minimum amount and maximum amount of the ibnr component 
to most accurately determine the best estimate  our actuaries determine the point estimate within their minimum and maximum range by similar medical expense categories within lines of business 
the medical expense categories we use are in patient facility  outpatient facility  all professional expense  and pharmacy 
the lines of business are medicare and commercial 
the development of the ibnr estimate generally considers favorable and unfavorable prior period developments and uses standard actuarial developmental methodologies  including completion factors  claims trends  and provisions for adverse claims developments 
completion factors estimate liabilities for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid and takes into consideration factors such as expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  and membership changes 
the completion factor is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the total claims for services rendered for a given reporting period 
although the completion factor is generally reliable for older service periods  it is more volatile  and hence less reliable  for more recent periods given that the typical billing lag for services can range from a week to as much as days from the date of service 
our use of claims trend factors considers many aspects of the managed care business 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical expense trend and include the incidences of illness or disease state 
accordingly  we rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs  and growth of our members by type in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends  and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated as opposed to a fee for service basis 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes  and epidemics may impact medical expense trends 
other internal factors  such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical expense trends 
medical expense trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
we apply different estimation methods depending on the month of service for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of ibnr  we estimate our claims incurred by applying the observed trend factors to the trailing twelve month pmpm costs 
for prior months  costs have been estimated using completion factors 
in order to estimate the pmpms for the most recent months  we validate our estimates of the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months using actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided  and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
we also recognize in our medical claims liability a provision for adverse claims development  which is intended to account for variability in claims payment patterns  historical trends  and environmental factors 
we believe that our provision for adverse claims development is appropriate because our hindsight analysis indicates this additional provision is needed to cover additional unknown adverse claims not anticipated by the standard assumptions used to produce the ibnr estimates that were incurred prior to but paid after a period end 
our provision for adverse claims development as of the last three year ends has been relatively consistent 
primarily as a result of the growth and stabilizing trends experienced in our medicare business  continued favorable development of prior period ibnr estimates  and the continued decline in our commercial line of business  the provision for adverse claims development has become a relatively insignificant component of medical claims liability 
the completion and claims trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors that management believes are reasonably likely based on our historical experience and december  data 
table of contents completion factor a claims trend factor b increase increase increase decrease increase decrease decrease in medical decrease in medical in factor claims liability in factor claims liability dollars in thousands a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to estimates for a given reporting period 
accordingly  an increase in completion factor results in a decrease in the remaining estimated liability for medical claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trends used to estimate pmpm costs for the most recent three months 
each month  we re examine the previously established medical claims liability estimates based on actual claim submissions and other relevant changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact  we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in medical expenses in the period in which the change is identified 
in every annual reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with prior years 
the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical claims liability for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of period acquisition of lmc health plans incurred related to current period prior period total incurred paid related to current period prior period total paid balance at the end of the period the negative amounts reported in the table above for incurred related to prior periods result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated a favorable development 
a positive amount reported for incurred related to prior periods would result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated an unfavorable development 
for the years ended december  and  actual claims expense developed favorably by and  respectively  as compared to estimated medical claims expense 
the favorable overall claims development experienced in includes favorable commercial claims liability development of million 
our commercial hmo membership declined from  members at december  to  members at december   or by  primarily as a result of the non renewal by employers in tennessee and alabama 
commercial medical claims payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  our medical claims liability also considers premium deficiency situations and evaluates the necessity for additional related liabilities 
premium deficiency accruals were and approximately million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents premium revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from cms  and to a lesser extent our commercial customers  to provide healthcare benefits to our members 
we receive premium payments on a pmpm basis from cms to provide healthcare benefits to our medicare members  which premiums are fixed on an annual basis by contracts with cms 
although the amount we receive from cms for each member is fixed  the amount varies among medicare plans according to  among other things  demographics  geographic location  age  gender  and the relative risk score of the plan s membership 
we generally receive premiums on a monthly basis in advance of providing services 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as deferred revenue 
we recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
any amounts that have not been received are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable 
our medicare premium revenue is subject to adjustment based on the health risk of our members under what is referred to as cms s risk adjustment payment methodology 
risk adjustment uses health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms initially phased in this payment methodology in whereby the risk adjusted payment represented of the payment to medicare health plans  with the remaining being based on demographic factors 
in  the portion of risk adjusted payments was increased to 
the pdp payment methodology is based on the risk adjustment model 
under the risk adjustment payment methodology  managed care plans must capture  collect  and report diagnosis code information to cms 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive risk premium adjustment for a given fiscal year generally occurs during the third quarter of such fiscal year 
this initial settlement the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on the prior year s dates of service 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk premium adjustment settlement for the fiscal year in the following year the final cms settlement 
prior to  we were unable to estimate the impact of either of these risk adjustment settlements  and as such recorded them upon notification from cms of such amounts 
in the first quarter of  we began estimating and recording on a monthly basis the initial cms settlement  as we concluded we had the ability to reasonably estimate such amounts 
similarly in the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded the final cms settlement for  as we concluded such amounts were reasonably estimable 
the final cms settlement for was recorded during the third quarter of when received from cms 
premium revenue for includes both final cms settlements for and as of january  we will estimate and record on a monthly basis both the initial cms settlement and the final cms settlement for the cms plan year 
all such estimated amounts are periodically updated as necessary as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or the company receives notification from cms of such settlement amounts 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of the excess 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and no longer depreciated 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
we determine the useful life and amortization method for definite life intangible assets based on the guidance in fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for all periods through the quarter ended september   the straight line method of amortization was applied for medicare member network intangible asset associated with our recapitalization the recapitalization asset  as a better pattern could not be reliably determined based on available information 
effective october   we began applying a year accelerated method of amortization for this asset 
since the date of acquiring the 
table of contents member network asset in  we have tracked actual attrition rates experienced within the member network and believe that there is now adequate historical data to make reliable estimates regarding future attrition rates for amortization purposes 
based on our review of historical attrition rates  we believe the accelerated method of amortization over the revised estimated life better approximates the distribution of economic benefits realized from the recapitalization asset 
the use of an accelerated method prior to september  would have resulted in the recognition of amortization expense that is not materially different from the amounts recognized under the straight line method used by us during the same periods 
we will continue to monitor our actual attrition rates realized in future periods and adjust amortization schedules accordingly 
similarly  we are using a year accelerated method of amortization for the medicare member network intangible acquired as part of the acquisition of leon medical centers health plans  inc on october  our accounting for this change related to the recapitalization asset resulted in incremental amortization expense of million during the quarter ended december  over the amount of expense recognized using the straight line method in prior quarters of and did not have a material effect on our reported income before income taxes  net income  or net income per share for the quarter and year ended december  as a result of the change related to the recapitalization asset  we expect amortization expense for the year ended december  to increase approximately million over the amount recognized in the year ended december  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
we have selected december as our annual testing date 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we have four reporting units  in alabama  florida  tennessee and texas 
we conducted an annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that the carrying value of the reporting units did not exceed their fair value 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled  as applicable  based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we also have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
we accrue for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
these amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted 
table of contents as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance  or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had the following assets that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates december  asset class in thousands investment securities  available for sale current portion non current portion investment securities  held to maturity current portion non current portion restricted investments we have not purchased any of our investments for trading purposes 
our investment securities classified as available for sale consist primarily of highly liquid government and corporate debt securities 
for all other investment securities  we intend to hold them to their maturity and classify them as current on our balance sheet if they mature between three and months from the balance sheet date and as long term if their maturity is more than one year from the balance sheet date 
these investment securities  both current and long term  consist of highly liquid government and corporate debt obligations  the majority of which mature in five years or less 
the investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of the relatively short term nature of our investments and our portfolio mix of variable and fixed rate investments  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
moreover  because of our ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity  we would not expect foreseeable changes in interest rates to materially impair their carrying value 
restricted investments consist of certificates of deposit  money market fund investment and government securities deposited or pledged to state departments of insurance in accordance with state rules and regulations 
at december  and december   these restricted assets are recorded at amortized cost and classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date because of the restrictive nature of the states requirements 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately  similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments of approximately  unless we determined  however  that the increase in interest rates caused more than a temporary impairment in our investments  or unless we were compelled by a currently unforeseen reason to sell securities  such a change should not affect our future earnings or cash flows 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we have in place million of senior secured credit facilities bearing interest at variable rates at specified margins above either the agent bank s alternate base rate or its libor rate 
the senior secured credit facilities consist of the term facility  which is a million  five year term loan  and the revolving facility  which is a million  five year revolving credit facility 
although changes in the alternate base rate of the libor rate would affect the costs of funds borrowed in the future  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow would not be material 
as of december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a increase in interest rates would have an estimated impact on pre tax earning and cash flows for the next twelve month period of  we have not taken any action to cover interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities
