the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
periodically  the company reviews its estimates and judgments including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  warranty obligations  litigation  environmental reserves  pensions and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition sales must meet the following criteria in order to be recognized as revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product must be shipped to customer  thereby assuring delivery  whereby shipment results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  an established sales price has been set with the customer  collection of the sale revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
the company estimates and records provisions for quantity rebates  sales returns and allowances in the period the revenue is recognized  based upon its experience 
these items are included as a reduction in net sales 
b allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to identify all specific customers that are considered doubtful of collection based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other relevant factors  and those accounts that have been turned over for collection and to reserve the portion of such accounts receivable for which collection does not appear likely 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 
c allowance for inventory obsolescence the company s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified  discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with usage and sales levels over the last year to two years 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all years presented 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence  which applies primarily to our decorative products segment  was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 

table of contents d litigation and environmental reserves from time to time  the company is subject to claims  lawsuits and proceedings related to product liability  product warranty  contract  employment  environmental and other matters arising out of the company s business 
the company provides a reserve for such matters when it concludes a loss is probable and the amount can be estimated 
costs related to environmental compliance are also accrued when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be estimated 
e pensions and other post retirement plans the company accounts for its pension and other post retirement plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the company recognizes the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date 
the measurement provision of this statement will be effective for years beginning after december   with early application encouraged 
the company has not yet adopted the measurement provisions of this statement 
as of november   included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was unrecognized prior service costs credits of million and unrecognized actuarial loss of million 
the estimated net loss and prior service cost for defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in pension expense during are million and million  respectively 
the estimated net gain and prior service cost for retiree medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in other post retirement credits during are million and million  respectively 
the most significant elements in determining the company s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the company recorded non cash pension expense of million in both and pension expense is calculated using the discount rate  as determined below  used to discount plan liabilities at the prior year measurement date 
thus  the rates of and were used to calculate the pension expense in and  respectively 
the company anticipates non cash expense to be approximately million 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
the company determined the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities at the plan s measurement date  which was august  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  the company considered rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized investment ratings agency 
changes in discount rates  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as prescribed by sfas no 
with the higher yields and risk environment in  the company increased the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations to a discount rate of from a discount rate of in the measurement date of august  was used to determine this rate 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the pension portfolio 
this 
table of contents resulted in the selection of a long term rate of return on assets assumption of for plan years and the measurement dates of august  and were used to determine these rates 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return for assets would increase or decrease the assets by approximately million and would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million 
based on asset performance  interest rate and discount rate assumptions and current pension funding rules  the company does not anticipate that a cash contribution to the pension fund will be required prior to however  this funding analysis is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions and such changes may accelerate or delay the requirement to make a cash contribution 
currently  the pension plan has a credit balance that will cover cash contribution requirements for the next two years 
factors that could alter the cash requirements and timing of any such cash equivalents are investment returns which differ materially from the company s return assumption 
significant changes in interest rates  affecting the discount rate 
opportunities to reduce future cash requirements by accelerating contributions ahead of the minimum required schedule
