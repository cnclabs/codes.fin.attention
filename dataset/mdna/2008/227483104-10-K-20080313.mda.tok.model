item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are a leading provider of nurse and allied staffing services in the united states  a provider of clinical trials services to global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers  as well as a provider of other human capital management services focused on healthcare 
our nurse and allied staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel and per diem nurse staffing and travel allied health staffing 
travel nurse staffing  our core business  represented approximately of our total revenue and of our nurse and allied staffing business segment revenue 
other nurse and allied staffing services include the placement of per diem nurses and allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists 
our clinical trials services business segment represented approximately of our revenue 
our other human capital management services business segmen t represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue was million  and net income was million  or per diluted share 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and we ended the year with total debt of million and million of cash  resulting in a ratio of debt  net of cash  to total capitalization of as of december  in general  we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by revenue  contribution income see segment information  and net income 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
in addition  in our largest business segment  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes and price 
nurse and allied staffing our nurse and allied staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of nurses and demand for our staffing services at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals could limit our ability to fill open orders and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
we also believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
cross country staffing is our core staffing brand that markets its staffing services to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the us as well as operates differentiated recruiting brands to recruit registered nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
as a part of its business strategy  cross country staffing is pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital clients and group purchasing organizations 
cross country staffing provides clients with a suite of solutions to facilitate the efficient management of their temporary workforce while decreasing overall operating costs 
these range from efficiency enhancing technology to full vendor management solutions 
we operate differentiated nurse recruiting brands including cross country travcorps  medstaff  novapro  cross country local and assignment america to recruit nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
we believe that these professionals are attracted to us because we offer a wide range of diverse assignments at attractive locations  competitive compensation and benefit packages  as well as high levels of customer service 
typically  as admissions increase for our hospital customers  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their staff employees 
the current market for our nurse and allied staffing services reflects hospital admission trends that have been flat since and  more recently  a softening labor market in key states for us such as california  florida and arizona 
in  our orders for travel nurses in these three key states  which accounted for of our working nurses  declined in aggregate from the prior year while increasing modestly in aggregate in the rest of the country 
nevertheless  in this operating environment we continued to increase the bill pay spread in our nurse and allied staffing segment  which more than offset lower staffing volume resulting in higher contribution income 
bill rates  as measured by revenue per hour per in our core travel nurse staffing business  continued to rise in the low single digit range that we have experienced over the past several years 
while there is the potential for the business environment for nurse and allied staffing to weaken if the labor markets soften further  hospital operators appear to have incorporated a lower level of expectations into their nurse staffing plans 
we believe that these lower admissions expectations hold a greater potential for an upside surprise  as compared to a downside surprise  and create a more favorable dynamic for us 
clinical trials services we provide a flexible range of traditional contract staffing  clinical research outsourcing  drug safety monitoring  and regulatory consulting services to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  as well as contract research organization cro customers 
we market these services through our clinforce brand  as well as through additional brands that we have acquired since august together they have allowed us to establish a significant geographic footprint in the us along with an important presence in the european market 
according to various estimates  the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry s spending on r d has grown more than six fold over the past years barron s  november 
additionally  in  r d spending is expected to top billion with two thirds of it focused on testing 
pharmaceutical companies have always depended on innovation and r d for bringing new products to market 
however  an increasing trend of outsourcing r d has developed as the operating environment has grown more and more competitive and the number of challenges in drug development expanded 
for over a decade  companies have commonly used outsourcing solutions for clinical research and testing 
traditionally thought of as a short term strategy  outsourcing is now being used to lever the pharmaceutical industry s core competencies to maximize productivity 
further  outsourcing is being considered and or used to effectively manage multi ple projects at a given time and  most importantly  to reduce the timeline for drug development  with a long term view towards cost and resource management 
the global market for contract clinical research services is highly fragmented and comprises cros of varying size  as well as hundreds of niche service providers and independent consultants 
the global r d outsourcing market is expected to grow from billion in to billion by  representing an average growth rate of compared to an expected average growth rate of in global r d expenditures

critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various ass umptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we also completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarters of  and based on the results of the tests  we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets relating to continuing operations as of december    and the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of net assets held for sale to determine if the net assets are impaired 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued employee compensation and benefits on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial models  as well as industry experience and trends 
if such models indicate that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment as well as actual company experience and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we had million and nb sp  million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
corporate and field employees are covered through a partially self insured health plan 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of the incurred but not reported health insurance claims accrual related to corporate employees 
workers compensation insurance accruals have generally increased over time due to an increase in the number of employees and inflation  as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions  net of related insurance recoveries receivable  an increase of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an internally prepared actuarial model reviewed by an independent actuary 
as of december  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions  net of related insurance recovery receivable 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an internally prepared actuarial model which is reviewed by an independent actuary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectibility as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against the company  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business are described in legal proceedings 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the current portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of the income taxes payable account  and the non current portion is included within other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that the company has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that it s annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
adoption of fasb statement no 
revised on january   we adopted fasb statement no 
r using the modified prospective method 
fasb statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
under the modified prospective approach  the recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r are applied prospectively 
for prior periods  companies are required to disclose the pro forma impact of adopting the standard for prior periods 
all of our options outstanding as of december  were fully vested as a result of the decision to accelerate the vesting of any unvested options as of december  a total of  options  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  were accelerated 
of these options  had exercise prices below market value in the money options as of december  the reason for the acceleration was to avoid recognizing associated compensation expense for these options in future periods consolidated statements of income 
we estimated the pre tax charge avoided in future periods by the acceleration of these options to be approximately million excluding the impact of forfeitures 
in conjunction with the acceleration  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the acceleration of in the money options we estimated would not have otherwise vested 
this charge was included in selling  general  and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
we expect there to be no further impact  from the share based payments that were outstanding as of december   on our consolidated statements of income 
however  stock based compensation expense could become material to us depending on the number of options or other forms of equity based compensation that are granted in the future 
we used the black scholes method for disclosures prior to adoption 
after reviewing alternative valuation methods  we selected to continue using the black scholes method based on our prior experience with it  and its wide use by other issuers comparable to us 
we will consider the use of another model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate for us  or  if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated using black scholes 
the stock incentive plan plan was approved by our stockholders at its annual meeting of stockholders  held in may 
the plan provides for the issuance of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  performance shares  and other stock based awards  all as defined by the plan  to eligible employees  consultants and non employee directors 
see note stockholders equity for further information about share based payments granted subsequent to the adoption of fasb statement no

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fasb statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this standard allows companies to elect to follow fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities in an effort to mitigate volatility in earnings without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
fasb statement no 
is applicable only to certain financial instruments and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  as we do not intend to elect fair value treatment for qualifying instruments that exist as of the effective date  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we may elect to measure qualifying instruments at fair value in the future 
in december  the fasb issued fasb no 
r  business combinations fasb r  which replaces fasb fasb r applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses and requires that all assets and liabilities of an acquired business as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree be recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date 
contingent consideration arrangements will be recognized at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings 
pre acquisition contingencies will also typically be recognized at their acquisition date fair values 
in subsequent periods  contingent liabilities will be measured at the higher of their acquisition date fair values or the estimated amounts to be realized 
the statement is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we expect fasb r could have an impact on our future consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
seasonality the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment with us is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings 
hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate which impact our number of orders for a particular period 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
likewise  the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals 
this historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and th e results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our credit facility  which bears interest based on floating rates 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in  million in  and million in we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated less than of our consolidated revenue during the year ending december   and were primarily from the united kingdom 
we have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our non us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  included in other stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet
