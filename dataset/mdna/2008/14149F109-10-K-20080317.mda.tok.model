in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
overview we are a locally managed financial holding company headquartered in tysons corner  virginia  committed to providing superior customer service  a diversified mix of financial products and services  and convenient banking to our retail and business consumers 
we own cardinal bank the bank  a virginia state chartered community bank  cardinal wealth services  inc cws  an investment services subsidiary  and wilson bennett capital management  inc wilson bennett  an asset management firm 
through these three subsidiaries and george mason mortgage  llc george mason  a mortgage banking subsidiary of the bank  we offer a wide range of traditional banking products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors  commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals  such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
we have branch office locations and seven mortgage banking office locations and provide competitive products and services 
we complement our core banking operations by offering a full range of investment products and services to our customers through our third party brokerage relationship with raymond james financial services  inc and asset management services through wilson bennett 
on february   we acquired certain fiduciary and other assets and assumed certain liabilities of fbr national trust company  formerly a subsidiary of friedman  billings  ramsey group  inc services provided by this division include trust  estates  custody  investment management  escrows  and retirement plans 
the trust division is included  along with cws and wilson bennett  in the wealth management and trust services segment 
on june   we acquired wilson bennett for a total consideration of million  which consisted of a payment of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of our common stock  which we valued at million 
wilson bennett s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the purchase date 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
wilson bennett uses a value oriented approach that focuses on large capitalization stocks 
wilson bennett s primary source of revenue is management fees earned on the assets it manages for its customers 
these management fees are generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets and  accordingly  revenues from wilson bennett will be  assuming a consistent customer base  more when appropriate indices  such as the s p  are higher and lower when such indices are depressed 
in july  we acquired george mason 
george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through seven branches located throughout the metropolitan washington  dc region 
george mason does business in eight states  primarily virginia and maryland  and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater washington metropolitan area  generating originations of approximately billion and billion of loans in and  respectively  excluding advances on construction loans and including loans purchased from other mortgage banking companies which are owned by local home builders but managed by george mason the managed companies 
george mason s primary sources of revenue include net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gains on sales of loans and contractual management fees earned relating to services provided to the managed companies 
loans are made pursuant to purchase commitments and are sold servicing released 
george mason also offers a construction to permanent loan program 
this program provides variable and fixed rate financing for customers to construct their residences 
once the home has been completed  the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market 
these construction to permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for george mason and are classified as loans held for sale 
george mason s business is both cyclical and seasonal 
the cyclical nature of its business is influenced by  among other factors  the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates  national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy 
historically  george mason has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year 
in july  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and pay interest at a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at par beginning september under certain qualifying events  these securities are redeemable at a premium through march and at par thereafter 
the interest rate on this debt was at december  we have guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by us to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it entirely 
in addition to management of interest rate risk  we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  non interest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes  among other things  service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income and gains and losses on sales of investment securities available for sale  gains on sales of loans and management fee income 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income non interest income is a lower percentage of our total revenue in than and because mortgage originations were lower due to the cyclical nature of the mortgage banking business 
current business environment during the second half of  extreme dislocations emerged in the financial markets  including the leveraged finance  subprime mortgage  and commercial paper markets 
these financial conditions continue to negatively affect the economy and the financial services sector in the slowdown of the economy  significant decline in consumer real estate prices  and the downturn in the housing sector have affected our mortgage banking business and may impact our commercial and retail loan portfolio 
we expect that certain industry sectors  in particular those that are dependent on the housing sector  will experience further stress 
the subprime mortgage dislocation has also impacted the ratings of certain monoline insurance providers monolines which has affected the pricing of certain municipal securities and the liquidity of the short term public finance markets 
we have some exposure to monolines and as a result are continuing to monitor this exposure as the markets evolve 
of the million in our municipal securities portfolio  million remain aaa rated while approximately million were downgraded to single a status after december   due to the downgrades of the monoline insurance companies that insured those bonds 
these bonds remain unlimited general obligations of the municipalities 
the above conditions  together with uncertainty in energy costs and the overall economic slowdown  which may ultimately lead to recessionary conditions  might affect other areas in which we do business and may adversely impact our results in the degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions in this rapidly changing business and interest rate environment financial developments the year ended december  was our fifth consecutive year of profitability 
for the year  we reported net income of million 
george mason contributed million to consolidated net income during the wealth management and trust services segment  which includes cws  wilson bennett and our trust division  recorded a net loss for totaling million 
this segment reported a loss because of million in expense resulting from an arrangement where we served as the escrow agent in connection with an equity financing transaction between liberty growth fund and aims worldwide 
the million expense caused by this transaction is discussed in detail in the financial overview section below 
total assets increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased to billion at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
total deposits decreased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total other borrowed funds increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  for the year ended december   we reported net income of million 
george mason contributed million to consolidated net income during the wealth management and trust services segment  which includes cws  wilson bennett and the trust services division since the date of its acquisition  february   recorded a net loss of million 
this segment reported a loss as a result of the unexpected retirement of john w 
fisher  wilson bennett s founder  chief executive officer and president  which caused a non cash impairment charge of million 
this charge is discussed in detail in the financial overview section below 
total assets increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total loans receivable  net of deferred fees and costs  increased to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
total deposits increased by million in  from billion at december   to billion at december  total other borrowed funds increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per diluted common share 
george mason contributed million to consolidated net income during the wealth management and trust services segment  which included cws and wilson bennett from the date of its acquisition  june   recorded net income of  for critical accounting policies general us generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions  judgments  and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results  in fact  could differ from initial estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for economic hedging activities  accounting for business combinations and impairment testing of goodwill  accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets  and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
unusual and infrequently occurring events  such as hurricanes and other weather related disasters  may impact our assessment of possible credit losses 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors  such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 
for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
in the absence of meaningful historical loss factors  peer group loss factors are applied and are adjusted by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent 
since we have limited historical data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we typically apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to all loans classified as special mention  a loss factor to all loans classified as substandard and a loss factor to all loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
in certain instances  we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis 
for these loans  we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and consider estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis 
if the net collateral value is less than the loan balance including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are adequate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment 
additional provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
accounting for economic hedging activities we account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  as amended  which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the statement of condition at their fair values 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
for derivatives designated as hedges  we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship  including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness 
we evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis 
ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective 
in situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including rate lock commitments  to finance residential mortgage loans 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts 
during the rate lock commitment period  these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
 as amended 
the fair values of loan commitments and the fair values of forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions  and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
at the closing of the loan  the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract 
the forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale 
loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
prior to october   the changes in value of the forward loan sales contracts from the date the loan closed to the date it was sold to an investor were marked to market through earnings 
on october   we began designating our forward sale contracts as hedges to mitigate the variability in cash flow to be received from the sale of mortgage loans 
accounting for business combinations and impairment testing of goodwill we account for acquisitions of other businesses in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
this statement mandates the use of purchase accounting and  accordingly  assets and liabilities  including previously unrecorded assets and liabilities  are recorded at fair values as of the acquisition date 
we utilize a variety of valuation methods to estimate fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
to support our purchase allocations  we have utilized independent consultants to identify and value identifiable purchased intangibles 
the difference between the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and any other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested on at least an annual basis for impairment 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets  including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
new financial accounting standards on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement principles for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have included the required disclosures in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item below 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability at the measurement date 
the statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement 
it also establishes a fair value hierarchy used in fair value measurements and expands the required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas sfas no 
allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between entities that elect different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard to determine the impact  if any  on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings 
sab no 
requires fair value measurements of derivatives or other written loan commitments recorded through earnings to include the future cash flows related to the loan s servicing rights 
sab no 
also states that internally developed intangible assets should be excluded from these measurements 
sab no 
 which supersedes sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments  applies to all loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
previously  sab no 
applied to only derivative loan commitments accounted for at fair value through earnings 
sab no 
should be applied prospectively to derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 certain assumptions used in valuation methods 
sab no 
extends the use of the simplified method  under certain circumstances  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
prior to the issuance of sab no 
 sab no 
stated that the simplified method was only available for grants made up to december  we are continuing the use of the simplified method

for the year ended december   we recorded a million loss on an escrow arrangement with liberty growth fund  lp and aims worldwide  inc we served as the escrow agent in connection with an equity financing transaction between liberty growth fund and aims worldwide 
in that transaction  liberty growth fund had agreed to purchase from aims worldwide shares of its preferred stock for million 
aims worldwide would then use these proceeds to fund its acquisition of two other companies 
as provided in the escrow agreement  liberty growth fund delivered a check to us in the amount of million on july  on july   we released funds totaling million to aims worldwide and certain of its designated beneficiaries and shares of aims worldwide s preferred stock and warrants to an agent of liberty growth fund 
we then learned that liberty growth fund had previously stopped payment on its check 
liberty growth fund issued another check in the same amount  but that check was dishonored for lack of sufficient funds 
of the million released  we recovered  from one of the parties involved in the transaction 
we continue to pursue this issue through the legal avenues available to us in order to recover the total amount we are due 
we hold in escrow additional shares of aims worldwide s preferred stock that may be issued in a potential second round of financing with liberty growth fund 
however  we are not the beneficial owner of these shares 
in addition  we have made a claim to our insurance company in order to recover any amounts that may be covered 
on february   a complaint for declaratory relief was filed by onebeacon midwest company onebeacon against us 
onebeacon provides insurance coverage for us and we have filed an insurance claim and proof of loss to recover the million attributable to the above referenced loss on the escrow arrangement between liberty growth fund lp and aims worldwide  inc onebeacon is seeking a determination of their rights and obligations under a financial institution bond issued by onebeacon to us with respect to this claim and proof of loss 
through this action  onebeacon seeks a court declaration that the financial institution bond does not provide coverage for our claim 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash impairment charge 
in july  we announced the retirement of john w 
fisher  wilson bennett s founder  chief executive officer and president  from wilson bennett and as a member of our board of directors 
as mr 
fisher transitioned out of his involvement with wilson bennett  several significant clients unexpectedly either terminated or advised us that they intended to terminate their asset management contracts 
this triggered an evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
accordingly  we updated our analysis of the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of wilson bennett 
the updated analysis indicated an impairment to the goodwill and certain customer relationships and mr 
fisher s employment agreement 
since mr 
fisher s retirement announcement  wilson bennett has added experienced portfolio managers and professional sales staff to assist with cross sell opportunities with our other divisions 
we will continue to monitor the operations of wilson bennett  its customer base and managed and custodial assets and any associated impact on goodwill and the remaining intangible assets in the future 
excluding the loss on the escrow arrangement during and the impairment charges recorded during  we would have recorded net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to our gaap financial information is presented in table below 
also contributing to our decrease in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was an increase in our provision for loan losses of million to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the significant loan growth we had during the year

the federal reserve continued this policy in  increasing the federal funds rate eight times to by year end  and in increased the federal funds rate four times to by year end

interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk 
our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 
we employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity 
we use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were liability sensitive for the entire two year simulation period 
liability sensitive means that we have more liabilities repricing than assets 
we have more of our liabilities in non maturity or short term deposit products than we have in floating rate assets 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  net interest income would grow for a liability sensitive bank 
in the down basis point scenario  net interest income improves by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
in the up basis point scenario  net interest income decreases by not less than and by not less than over the two year time horizon compared to the base case 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio at december  was compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan loss ratio is primarily reflective of an improvement in overall credit quality and our evaluation of our loan portfolio and the qualitative factors we use to determine the adequacy of our loan loss reserve 
we continued to experience strong loan quality with annualized net charged off loans of to average loans receivable for the year ended december   and no non performing loans at december  the provision for loan losses was million for the growth in loans during was comprised primarily of increases in our construction  residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios  which require a higher allocation of the allowance than the remainder of the loan portfolio

non interest income non interest income includes service charges on deposits and loans  gains on sales of loans held for sale  investment fee income  management fee income  and gains on sales of investment securities available for sale  and continues to be an important factor in our operating results 
non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of decreased gains on sales of loans held for sale of million and a decrease in management fee income of million 
the decrease in gains on sales of loans held for sale and management fee income is due to the slowdown in the regional housing market 
included in the net gains on sales of loans held for sale are any origination  underwriting  and discount points and other funding fees that were received and deferred at loan origination 
costs include direct costs associated with loan origination  such as commissions and salaries that are deferred at the time of origination 
management fees represent the income earned for services george mason provides to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders and generally fluctuates based on the volume of loan sales 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  deposit service charges increased primarily as a result of an increased number of transaction accounts in compared to loan service charges decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in loan service charges decreased due to decreases in loan originations at george mason during  compared to originations during because of the aforementioned slowdown in the regional housing market 
investment fee income increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in investment fee income is primarily attributable to a full year of operations of the trust division in and higher monthly fee income

investment securities our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity 
the investment portfolio consists of investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity 
investment securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily until maturity 
these securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset liability strategy  liquidity management or regulatory capital management 
investment securities held to maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities were million at december   an increase of million or  from million in investment securities at december  of the million in the investment portfolio at december   million were classified as held to maturity  and million were classified as available for sale

at december  and  the amortized cost of tax exempt municipal securities was million and million  respectively 
at december  and  investment securities with unrealized losses are investment grade securities 
investment securities with unrealized losses have interest rates that are less than current market interest rates and  therefore  the indicated temporary losses are not a result of permanent credit impairment 
mortgage backed investment securities  which are the primary component of the unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio at those dates  are primarily comprised of securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and government national mortgage association gnma 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of securities backed or guaranteed by fnma or fhlmc 
for all non government or agency securities  we complete reviews for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
as of december   our investment securities portfolio consists of all aaa rated securities 
investment securities which carry a aaa rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk 
we expect to receive full payment of interest and principal on the securities in the investment portfolio 
the various protective elements on our non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes  which could impact the ratings of our securities

capital resources capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance 
our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution

we must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items into cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
we believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
we also maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet 
in this forecast  we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion 
we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
in addition  one stress test combines all other stress tests to see how liquidity would react to several negative scenarios occurring at the same time 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
in october  george mason and the bank cancelled its one year million floating rate revolving credit and security agreement with a third party 
the purpose of this credit facility was to fund residential mortgage loans made by george mason prior to their sale into the secondary market 
however  we determined that as a result of the limited use of this credit facility and the available liquidity at the bank  this credit facility was no longer needed 
in addition to this facility  this same lender had also provided a million facility that was utilized by george mason to warehouse residential mortgage loans held for sale to this lender 
again  this credit facility was cancelled in october as a result of the limited use by george mason of this facility and the available liquidity at the bank 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale  totaled million at december   or of total assets 
we held investments that are classified as held to maturity in the amount of million at december  to maintain ready access to the bank s secured lines of credit  the bank has pledged roughly a third of its securities to the federal home loan bank of atlanta with additional securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of richmond 
additional borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at december  was approximately million 
borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of richmond was approximately million at december  we anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources held or available to us 
the required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows table contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations certificates of deposit     brokered certificates of deposit    advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  trust preferred securities   operating lease obligations     total      financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
we have derivative counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason s third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
george mason maintains a reserve for loans sold that pay off earlier than the contractual agreed upon period  thereby requiring that george mason refund part of the service release premium and or premium pricing received from the investor 
the reserve as of december  and was  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december   george mason has established a reserve of  for possible repurchases of loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable 
during  george mason either repurchased from or settled with investors on seven such loans 
our total expense associated with these loans was  no such reserve existed at december  george mason  as part of the service it provides to its managed companies  purchases the loans managed companies originate at the time of origination 
these loans are then sold by george mason to investors 
george mason has agreements with its managed companies requiring that  for any loans that were originated by a managed company and for which investors have requested george mason to repurchase due to the borrowers failure to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable  the managed company be responsible for buying back the loan 
in the event that the managed company s financial condition deteriorates and it is unable to fund the repurchase of such loans  george mason may have to provide the funds to repurchase these loans from investors 
as of december   we do not believe we were obligated to fund any repurchased loans that were originated by a managed company 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   commitments to extend credit of million as of december  were related to george mason s pipeline and were of a short term nature 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
quarterly data the following table provides quarterly data for the years ended december  and quarterly per share results may not calculate to the year end per share results due to rounding 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a loss of million pretax and million after tax from our escrow arrangement with liberty growth fund  lp 
this loss was recorded in our wealth management and trust services segment 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment loss totaling million pretax and million after tax in our wealth management and trust services segment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing our liquidity requirements and maximizing our net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
interest rate risk arises because the assets of the bank and the liabilities of the bank have different maturities and characteristics 
in order to measure this interest rate risk  we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
this model is run for the bank by an independent consulting firm 
the simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged 
this becomes the base case 
next  the model determines the impact on net interest income given specified changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually increased by basis points in the first year and remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   we were liability sensitive for the entire two year simulation period 
liability sensitive means that we have more liabilities repricing than assets 
we have more of our liabilities in non maturity or short term deposit products than we have in floating rate assets 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  net interest income would grow for a liability sensitive bank 
in the down basis point scenario  net interest income improves by not more than for the one year period and by not more than over the two year time horizon 
in the up basis point scenario  net interest income decreases by not less than and by not less than over the two year time horizon compared to the base case 
see also interest rate sensitivity in item above for a discussion of our interest rate risk
