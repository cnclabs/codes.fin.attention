to the extent that such monetary amounts are derived from our consolidated financial statements attached to this management s discussion and analysis  they have been translated into us dollars in accordance with our accounting policies as described therein

our patented technology enables us to convert silver s microcrystalline structure into an atomically disordered nanocrystalline coating 
we believe that this conversion can enhance silver s natural antimicrobial properties and that currently marketed products with our silcryst tm coatings meet important patient needs 
in addition  our nanocrystalline silver has exhibited potent anti inflammatory properties in preclinical studies 
we produce our nanocrystalline silver as a coating for wound care products under the trademark silcryst tm and as a powder  which we refer to as npi  for use in medical devices and as an active pharmaceutical ingredient 
we developed and sold advanced wound care products with our silcryst tm coating under the acticoat tm trademark until may when we entered into a series of agreements with smith nephew plc smith nephew  a global medical device company 
under these original agreements  we licensed to smith nephew the exclusive right to market  distribute and sell products with our silcryst tm coatings for use on non minor skin wounds and burns on humans world wide  and agreed to manufacture these products and supply them exclusively to smith nephew 
we also sold various assets to smith nephew in connection with the license and supply agreements  including the acticoat tm trade name and trademark  various regulatory approvals and certain manufacturing equipment  which we lease back 
advanced wound care products with our silcryst tm coatings have received fda clearance and approval of other regulators and are now sold by smith nephew in over countries around the world  including the united states  under its acticoat tm trademark 
we work with smith nephew to develop new acticoat tm wound care products with our silcryst tm coating 
smith nephew s recently launched acticoat tm post op and acticoat tm site products resulted from these efforts  increasing the number of wound care products with our silcryst tm coating currently sold by smith nephew to a total of six 
on september   we entered into amended license and supply agreements with smith nephew that were restructured to better enable the parties to work jointly and individually to support both the continued growth of acticoat tm products and our respective businesses in the context of increasing competitive pressures 
pursuant to the amended agreements  a non compete clause in the original agreements was deleted to allow smith nephew to broaden its wound care dressings product line to include other forms of silver 
in exchange  smith nephew s exclusive license was limited in the new agreements to existing acticoat tm products and such new wound care or burn products that the parties agree to develop together using our nanocrystalline silver technology 
as well  under the new agreements  we may develop our own wound care and burn products using our nanocrystalline silver technology provided that we offer such products to smith nephew first 
if smith nephew declines to adopt and market the new products  we are then free to pursue the commercialization of the products in any manner we choose 
effective january   under the new supply agreement  the method by which we determine the price we charge for the products we manufacture and supply to smith nephew has been changed from a fully allocated cost of manufacturing reimbursement mechanism to a system whereby we recover a fixed overhead charge plus all direct costs incurred in manufacturing acticoat tm products  including direct material  direct labor  labeling  testing and packaging 
in addition  as part of the new pricing mechanism  we agreed to pay smith nephew an annual manufacturing cost rebate in the amount of million in each of  and in anticipation of annual reductions we intend to achieve in our cost of goods manufactured for smith nephew over the same time period 
we recognize the manufacturing cost rebate as a reduction to wound care product revenue 
we made adjustments to our manufacturing and research operations in to conserve cash and control expenses including reductions in our workforce of approximately of our total employees 
through these workforce reductions together with the implementation of manufacturing production 
table of contents efficiencies and overhead cost reduction initiatives  we achieved actual reductions in our overhead costs in sufficient to partially offset the manufacturing cost rebate we paid to smith nephew in our results of operations currently depend solely on acticoat tm product sales generated by smith nephew under our revised agreements 
the acticoat tm product line competes in the advanced wound care products market  which according to frost sullivan  a market research firm  was an approximately billion global market in and is projected to grow to approximately billion by the acticoat tm product line targets the premium priced segments of the serious wound care dressings market 
acticoat tm products are used for a wide variety of wound types by hospitals  clinics  burn centers  doctors offices  home healthcare agencies and nursing homes 
since the execution of the new agreements  smith nephew has introduced three new wound care products with other forms of silver algisite ag  allevyn ag and biostep ag 
we believe that some of these new silver based wound care products will serve to simply compliment the existing acticoat tm products marketed by smith nephew without impacting sales of acticoat tm products while others may be viewed by the advanced wound care market as alternatives to certain acticoat tm products  thereby potentially adversely affecting acticoat tm product sales and ultimately our operating revenues in the foreseeable future 
outside of our smith nephew agreements  we are continuing our efforts to extend our nanocrystalline silver technology to develop pharmaceutical products and other medical devices to combat infection and inflammation 
we are conducting preclinical research for the use of npi for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions and we are exploring commercialization avenues for a topical barrier cream containing npi our board of directors was pleased to announce that mr 
thomas e 
gardner was appointed chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
mr 
gardner is an experienced ceo with a track record of creating shareholder value 
we determined that mr 
gardner s experience in managing emerging healthcare technology companies would benefit nucryst in the development and commercialization of our pipeline medical products 
a director of nucryst since may  mr 
gardner specializes in the strategic positioning of companies with particular emphasis on pharmaceuticals  medical devices and healthcare information 
prior to his current assignments  mr 
gardner was ceo of a number of public and private companies including songbird hearing  datamonitor  base ten systems and access health 
from to  mr 
gardner held senior marketing and general management positions at procter gamble  johnson johnson  simon schuster and ims health 
we are a majority owned subsidiary of the westaim corporation westaim  a canadian company incorporated in alberta and the shares of which are listed on the toronto stock exchange 
westaim owns approximately of our outstanding common stock as of the date of filing of this annual report 
prior to our initial public offering  all of our external financing was provided by westaim and we relied upon westaim for the ongoing financial support necessary to operate our business 
we are now entirely reliant on third parties for financing necessary to satisfy any future need we may have for cash in excess of that which is generated by smith nephew sales of acticoat tm products 
we do not have any lines of credit or other financing arrangements in place with banks or other financial institutions 
we will likely require additional external financing in the future and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing as and when required 
revenue recognition we currently do not have any products being sold in the marketplace other than acticoat tm wound care products being sold by smith nephew 
consequently  our results of operations depend solely on acticoat tm product sales generated by smith nephew under our amended agreements with smith nephew 
the amount of our revenues in general and royalty revenues in particular  is determined primarily by the level of sales of acticoat tm products achieved by smith nephew 
we believe that the demand for acticoat tm products with our silcryst tm coatings licensed to smith nephew is and will be driven by demographic factors  including population aging  the incidence of medical conditions such as diabetes and obesity  by the displacement of traditional wound care products that we believe are clinically less effective than products using our silcryst tm coatings  by the introduction of acticoat tm products using our silcryst tm coatings to new countries and for new applications  and by the degree to which smith nephew is successful in selling and marketing these products in view of increasing competition from other silver based wound care products  including any such products that smith nephew may now introduce pursuant to its new freedom to do so under our amended agreements 
on february   smith nephew reported its annual results for wound care 
smith nephew reported acticoat tm sales growth of in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents however  we believe that market conditions in the advanced would care market  including the silver dressing segment  have become more competitive due in part to increased competition and customer cost containment efforts 
we are uncertain as to whether or the extent to which this increased competition or smith nephew s new ability to introduce other silver based serious wound care products will have a negative impact on acticoat tm product sales growth and our revenues in the near future  as it will depend on future events  including smith nephew s response to market conditions 
any termination of or significant disruptions in our agreements or relationship with smith nephew  or a significant reduction in sales of acticoat tm products  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our revenues under our amended license and supply agreements with smith nephew consist of manufacturing cost reimbursements on a fixed price basis  royalties  payments upon the achievement of specified milestones and reimbursement of a portion of the costs we incur in connection with the development of and improvement to silcryst tm coated products covered by the agreements 
smith nephew previously reimbursed us for our fully allocated costs of manufacturing the products we sell to them  including both direct and indirect costs 
under the new supply agreement  effective january   the price we char for the acticoat tm products we manufacture and supply to smith nephew has been amended to recovery of a fixed overhead charge plus all direct costs incurred in manufacturing acticoat tm products  including direct material  direct labor  labeling  testing and packaging 
this pricing mechanism will be used to establish the unit prices that we will charge for each acticoat tm product we supply to smith nephew until the end of unit prices will be set at the beginning of each year based on smith nephew s product forecast and may only be increased  with smith nephew s agreement  for any actual cost increases we incur that are outside our reasonable control and which increases are capped at the amount by which the local level of inflation has increased 
the overhead component of the unit pricing mechanism has been fixed at a minimum floor amount equal to all indirect costs we incur in related to the manufacture of acticoat tm products  including administration  labor  rent  insurance  utilities  repairs and quality control 
this fixed floor amount is payable by smith nephew in each of  and regardless of the actual volume of acticoat tm products ordered by smith nephew and regardless of any actual overhead cost savings we achieve in those years 
the new agreements provide for a reconciliation process such that if we have not received sufficient orders to cover the fixed overhead charge by a certain date each year  we are entitled to immediately invoice smith nephew for the difference 
on the other hand  if we have received orders in excess of that which is required to cover the fixed overhead charge by certain dates  smith nephew is entitled to immediately invoice us for the difference 
in any event  actual overhead will be reconciled at december of each year 
as part of the new pricing mechanism  we agreed to pay smith nephew an annual manufacturing cost rebate in the amount of million in each of  and in anticipation of annual reductions we intend to achieve in our cost of goods manufactured for smith nephew over the same time period 
we recognize the manufacturing cost rebate as a reduction to wound care product revenue 
we achieved actual reductions in our overhead costs in and expect to maintain these reductions and achieve further reductions through we expect the cost reductions will substantially and possibly even completely offset the impact of the manufacturing cost rebate on our wound care product revenues received from smith nephew 
in addition  if we are able to achieve cost savings such that our actual total cost of goods manufactured for smith nephew in any of the three years is less than of net sales of acticoat tm products  we have agreed to reimburse smith nephew of the amount by which our total cost of goods manufactured differs from the eighteen percent of net sales 
in  the revised agreements contemplate that we will determine a new cost recovery structure that takes into account actual cost savings we achieve in the previous three years 
our manufacturing costs are recorded both as expense and revenue items on the consolidated statement of operations to the extent they are directly reimbursable by smith nephew 
reductions in overhead costs will be reflected as a reduction of expense and may benefit our gross margin upon shipment to smith nephew 
in addition  although we are required to fund the up front costs of capital expenditures to acquire equipment used to manufacture acticoat tm products  we are entitled under our agreements to recoup those costs over time through reimbursement for depreciation expense 
at the end of the third quarter of  based on smith nephew s demand forecasts  we began construction of an expansion of our fort saskatchewan facility with an estimated cost of approximately million 
as of december   this expansion was substantially complete 
we expect the expansion to be operational in the first quarter of under the previous agreements  we would not have been entitled to begin recouping these costs over time from smith nephew through reimbursement for depreciation expense until we began using the equipment to produce acticoat tm products 
at the current rate of acticoat tm product sales growth  we did not anticipate needing the new manufacturing capacity as early as we had previously expected when we undertook the expansion and possibly not for the foreseeable future  such that we did not expect to be in a position to begin recovering depreciation expense from smith nephew for some time 

table of contents however  under the new amended agreements  commencing january   we will be entitled to include partial depreciation of the new production facility and equipment in the cost of goods sold to smith nephew 
once we begin using the equipment to produce acticoat tm products  inclusion of full depreciation in the cost of goods sold to smith nephew will commence subject to any proportionate use we make of the equipment for our own purposes 
the royalty rates under the new agreements have been maintained except for the elimination of a supplemental royalty that was payable to us only if certain gross profit margins were achieve on sales of acticoat tm products over a specified threshold 
we record our royalty revenues upon the sale of our products by smith nephew to its customers 
our royalty revenue varies in proportion to increases or decreases in smith nephew s sales of its acticoat tm products 
in that regard  smith nephew has authority to unilaterally determine the selling price for its acticoat tm products 
moreover  although smith nephew has agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to market acticoat tm products  smith nephew is not required to purchase any significant amount of product from us 
in may  in accordance with the agreements  the contractual royalty rate increased and from that date has remained and  under the terms of the agreements  is to remain constant for the life of the agreements  subject only to i the possibility of a negotiated arbitrator awarded reduction in royalty rates on sales in countries where patent protection has been lost and a competing product is being sold that would have infringed our patent rights had they been in effect  ii the possibility of a negotiated reduction in royalty rates on sales of a particular acticoat tm product where smith nephew does not realize industry standard gross profit margins on sales of such products  or iii a reduced royalty rate in respect of sales of acticoat tm products in certain countries  including the united states  upon the expiration of patent rights to our silcryst tm coating in such country 
upon the expiration of certain patents beginning in  we may be required to implement royalty reductions in respect of certain products in certain countries in which the patents have expired 
it is also possible that  from time to time  certain products may fall within category ii above on a temporary basis and  while we are not obligated to agree to royalty reductions in those circumstances  we may choose to do so if we determine it is appropriate under the circumstances 
we also receive milestone payments upon smith nephew s achievement of specified sales levels of acticoat tm products and upon the achievement of regulatory events specified in our agreements with smith nephew 
the achievement of both of these events is out of our control and  therefore  it is uncertain as to whether or when we will earn future milestone payments 
the new agreements amended the criteria for the achievement of the next milestone such that we immediately earned a milestone payment of million during the quarter ended september  we earned an additional million milestone in the fourth quarter of the achievement criteria for the remaining milestone payments remain unchanged under the new agreements 
the maximum amount of milestone payments that we may receive under the smith nephew agreements  including the million of milestone payments we have already received  is million 
the timing and receipt of a milestone payment affects the comparability of period to period results and may have a material effect on financial results 
smith nephew previously reimbursed us for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with approved research and development activities for the development of new products and improvements to existing products covered by our agreements with smith nephew 
under the new agreements  we will now cover our own internal development costs incurred in the joint development of new products with smith nephew up to a maximum amount per year equivalent to of smith nephew s net sales of acticoat tm products in the year 
thereafter  smith nephew will be required to once again reimburse us for all costs and expenses we incur in the joint development of new products with smith nephew in the year 
during the year ended december   no reimbursement for research and development costs was received from smith nephew 
all payments under our agreements with smith nephew are made to us in us dollars 
in calculating sales levels for milestone payments  and for other purposes under the agreements  sales by smith nephew in currencies other than the us dollar are converted to the us dollar based on the average exchange rate for the prior quarter 
we currently purchase most of our raw materials from single suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers could result in a disruption in our production while we arrange for a replacement supplier 
to reduce this risk  we maintain sufficient inventory levels to continue production for approximately six months 
the exclusive right we granted to smith nephew to market  distribute or sell existing acticoat tm products with our silcryst tm coatings in the field of serious wounds and burns does not apply to other types of products that we may develop for use outside of the field using our technology  including  among other things  the products we are developing using npi or our silcryst tm coating  except that  to the extent that any new products using our nanocrystalline silver have commercial value in the field of serious wounds and burns  we have agreed  as discussed above  to offer the new products to smith nephew for use in the field 
if smith nephew declines the new products  we are then free to commercialize the products in any manner we choose in any field 

table of contents new product development we bear all costs relating to our research and development activities for our prospective products outside of our agreements with smith nephew 
in the future  to expand our product line  we may consider acquisitions of intellectual property or companies engaged in the development or production of drugs or devices 
any acquisitions may require that we obtain additional financing 
pharmaceutical products we are developing pharmaceutical products using npi to extend our nanocrystalline silver technology to the treatment of infectious and inflammatory conditions 
we are currently focusing our research and development efforts on conducting preclinical work for pharmaceutical applications of our nanocrystalline technology 
medical devices we have developed a topical cream formulation containing our npi which has been shown in clinical studies to be stable and cosmetically acceptable 
in vitro testing has also shown the cream formulation to have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity 
we announced on july  that the fda granted k clearance for a prescription topical device containing our npi  as a broad spectrum antimicrobial barrier cream to organisms including pseudomonas aeruginosa  staphyloccocus aureus  including strains resistant to methicillin or mrsa 
gaining fda clearance is a first step toward marketing our proprietary technology in this new formulation 
we are actively exploring commercialization options and  as part of this process  market plans and timing for this product will be determined 
we expect that the market potential for this potential new product will be largely determined by the distribution channel decisions we are currently in the process of evaluating 
we have recently filed another k submission to the fda to expand the claims and indications for our barrier cream 
we have applied for a claim that npi cream relieves the signs and symptoms of dermatoses 
if our application is cleared by the fda  we believe it will broaden this potential new product s market potential 
results of operations year ended december in thousands wound care product revenue manufacturing cost rebate net product related revenue milestone revenue total revenue manufacturing costs gross margin excluding milestone revenue gross margin percent excluding milestone revenue certain milestone revenue may relate in part to sales activity in prior periods 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue is equal to wound care product revenue minus manufacturing costs 
gross margin percent excluding milestone revenue is equal to gross margin excluding milestone revenue divided by wound care product revenue 
year ended december  and december  revenue 
total revenue which consists of wound care product revenue less the manufacturing cost rebate and milestone revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable primarily to million in milestone payments that were earned from smith nephew 
the impact of these milestones were partially offset by the combined impact of the new manufacturing cost rebate we agreed to pay smith nephew in under the revised supply agreement  and the impact of an increase in wound care product revenue experienced in the year as compared to the same period in under the revised supply agreement  we are to pay smith nephew an annual million manufacturing cost rebate in  and in anticipation of annual reductions we intend to achieve in our cost of goods manufactured for smith nephew over the same time frame 
wound care product revenue which consists of royalty revenues and manufacturing cost reimbursements from smith nephew increased by approximately million to million for 
table of contents the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to increased product orders received from and shipped to smith nephew and increased royalty revenue received from smith nephew 
manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million is primarily attributable to the combined effect of manufacturing cost savings realized in the period through the implementation of efficiencies in our manufacturing process  together with the effect of the shipment to smith nephew in of products out of our finished goods inventory that were produced in at a lower cost per unit than products produced in at the end of  we had finished goods inventory of million as compared to million at december  during  we recognized significant cost reductions in our manufacturing process and overhead structure to partially offset the million manufacturing cost rebate paid to smith nephew in these cost reductions were achieved primarily through lower headcount  manufacturing process improvements and leased space consolidations 
we expect to continue to manage our manufacturing costs to achieve further reductions in gross margin 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue for the year ended december  was million or compared to million or for the year ended december  the decrease of million or is attributable primarily to a million manufacturing cost rebate that was recognized in as a reduction to wound care product revenue 
no such cost rebate amount was recognized in the year ended december  the effect of the manufacturing cost rebate on gross margin was only partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions realized in the period and the shipment of finished goods out of our inventory at the beginning of which had a lower cost per unit than goods subsequently produced and shipped to smith nephew in pursuant to our revised agreements with smith nephew  we have agreed to pay a million manufacturing cost rebate in each of and we expect the manufacturing cost rebate to continue to affect our gross margin in and to the extent that we are unable to realize and maintain manufacturing cost overhead reductions sufficient to offset the rebate in each of and we recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship our products to smith nephew and recognize royalty income when smith nephew sells our products to its customers 
consequently  our gross margin percent may vary from period to period due to differences in timing of when we ship our products to smith nephew and when smith nephew sells our products to its customers 
in the year ended december   we manufactured lower volumes of acticoat tm products as compared to the year ended december   due in part to the completion of smith nephew s program to increase world wide inventory levels in smith nephew did not build further inventory levels in lower production volumes in were also due to the fact that we ended with million of finished goods inventory which we used to satisfy product orders received from smith nephew in research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million from to is due in part to the fact that in the third quarter of we completed the only clinical study we had underway  our phase dermatological clinical study  and no new clinical studies were initiated in the decrease is also partly due to the reductions we made to our research operations and staff in to conserve cash and control expenses 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable primarily to stock option compensation expense recognized in the year  severance costs relating to the resignation of our former chief executive officer on august   consulting services relating to business development  placement fees for our new chief executive officer and design services for the consolidation of our leased manufacturing facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta 
income taxes 
income taxes are recognized for future income tax consequences attributed to estimated differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases 
we have net operating loss carry forward for income tax purposes of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  and unclaimed scientific research and experimental development expenditures of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  that can be used to offset taxable income  if any  in future periods 
we also have accumulated capital losses of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  as well as research and development tax credits of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  recognized losses and credits have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the net operating losses and research and development tax credits will expire at various times to the end of 
table of contents in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  and there can be no assurance when or if this will occur 
management will continue to provide a full valuation allowance until it determines that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our tax pools are subject to review and potential disallowance  in whole or in part  by the canada revenue agency cra in canada and the internal revenue service irs in the united states upon audit of our federal income tax returns  and we cannot predict the results of any such review 
in  the cra commenced an examination of our canadian income tax returns for and  and in december   we received correspondence from the cra proposing certain transfer pricing adjustments with respect to income allocations between our canadian and us entities for those years 
these proposed adjustments  if processed  will not result in any cash tax liability 
although the cra has not commenced any transfer pricing review for taxation years beyond  the proposed adjustments  based on the cra s primary position  are expected to be extended to subsequent taxation years 
we are currently evaluating the cra s proposal and awaiting reports from the cra which should provide greater details of the basis of their proposed adjustments 
following receipt of these reports  we will be better able to make an informed assessment of the cra s position 
any reassessments to be issued by the cra  on an aggregate basis  could result in a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  although at this time  the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated 
we have provided notification to the irs of our intention to seek competent authority assistance with respect to the and taxation years 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
fin also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties 
the implementation of the provisions of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  and did not result in any adjustment to our beginning tax positions 
as at january   we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 
during the year ended december   changes in the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions of prior years 
the additions were offset by reductions  resulting in no unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year 
although we believe in the merit of our tax filing positions and intend to rigorously defend our transfer pricing policies  it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
as this time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made 
any increase or decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits will not likely have a significant impact on our effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance 
future changes in our assessment of the sustainability of tax filing positions may impact our income tax liability 
the amount of net operating loss carryovers  or nols  which may be used by us for us federal income tax purposes in any future year could be limited by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in general  section would limit our ability to use nols for us federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes  either directly or indirectly  in ownership of our company  including as a result of sales of our common shares by westaim  future offerings of common shares by us  and changes in ownership of westaim 
if such limitations were triggered as a result of future shifts in ownership of us  the use of our nols for us federal income tax purposes would be limited 
any limitation of our use of nols could depending on the extent of such limitation and the amount of nols previously used result in us retaining less cash after payment of us federal income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income rather than losses than we would be entitled to retain if such nols were available as an offset against such income for us federal income tax reporting purposes 

table of contents for alternative minimum tax purposes in the united states  nols can be used to offset no more than percent of alternative minimum taxable income  or amti 
thus  to the extent our nols are used to offset regular taxable income  if any  alternative income tax will still be required to be paid on percent of amti at the alternative minimum tax rate of percent 
as noted elsewhere  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we cannot predict when or if we will generate taxable income and whether and to what extent we will be able to use our nols to offset any such taxable income 
year ended december  and december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  wound care product revenue which consists of royalty revenues and manufacturing cost reimbursements from smith nephew increased approximately to million for compared to million for due entirely to increased orders from smith nephew to support acticoat tm product sales growth and smith nephew s decision to increase world wide inventory levels of acticoat tm products 
no milestone payment was earned in the year ended december  and one million milestone payment was earned in our revenue in was reduced by an adjustment of million of manufacturing cost reimbursements that were determined to be non reimbursable 
manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is attributable primarily to higher production volumes of acticoat tm wound care products driven by increased orders from smith nephew to support its acticoat tm worldwide inventory levels and to support its acticoat tm sales growth 
in addition  the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar contributed to the increase in manufacturing costs 
gross margin 
gross margin excluding milestone revenue for the year ended december  was million or compared to million or for the year ended december  we recognize manufacturing revenue when we ship product to smith nephew and recognize royalty income when smith nephew sells our products to its customers 
consequently  our gross margin percent may vary from period to period due to differences in timing of when we ship product to smith nephew and when smith nephew sells product to its customers 
in the year ended december   we shipped substantially higher volumes of acticoat tm products to smith nephew as compared to the year ended december   and for which the related royalties were not earned 
this was due  in part  to smith nephew s program to increase world wide inventory levels in we do not earn royalties on products shipped to smith nephew and held in inventory until smith nephew sells our products to customers 
therefore  our gross margin percent for the year ended december  was lower compared to the percent for the year ended december  research and development costs 
research and development costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million from to is attributable to the phase dermatological clinical study that was undertaken in and completed in the third quarter of general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable primarily to the administrative costs associated with being a publicly traded company  including directors fees and expenses and higher legal and compliance costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased because we had no debt owing to westaim after the conversion of the remaining debt of million to million common shares on january  liquidity and capital resources on december   we completed our initial public offering of million common shares for gross proceeds of million 
we used million of net proceeds to partially repay debt owed to westaim and retained the remaining net proceeds of million to fund our operations 
from our inception through the closing of our initial public offering  we financed our operations through various financing arrangements with westaim 
because westaim no longer provides us with any additional financing or other financial support  we are now required to obtain any necessary financing from third parties 
we currently have no third party debt or lines of credit or other financing arrangements in place with banks or 
table of contents other financial institutions  but we may enter into a line of credit or other financing arrangement in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing as and when required  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we were indebted to westaim for a term loan in the amount of million  which bore interest at a rate of per annum 
on january   this debt was converted to million common shares at per share 
as a result  as at december   we owe no debt to westaim and westaim owns approximately of our common shares 
at the end of the third quarter of  we began construction of an expansion of our fort saskatchewan production facility with an estimated cost of approximately million 
we have substantially completed the expansion as of december  and expect the equipment to be operational during the first quarter of we also intend to continue pharmaceutical product development and expect to have increased working capital requirements to the extent we are successful in increasing our revenues 
in addition  we do not expect at this time to have capital expenditures for pharmaceutical development capital equipment in at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  as compared to million at december  and million at december  all cash and cash equivalents are held in the form of treasury bills

finished goods inventory was reduced by million as compared to december  due to orders placed by smith nephew late in and which shipped in as part of their worldwide inventory build 
in  excess silver raw material inventory was sold for proceeds of million which is reflected in accounts receivable with a corresponding reduction in the cost of inventory of million 
cash used in investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in each of these years  the most significant use of cash was for capital expenditures  which were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in capital spending in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was due to a major production expansion at our manufacturing facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta  which was completed in the first half of during  we spent approximately million on the design of a production facility to manufacture our active pharmaceutical ingredient  npi  that meets good manufacturing practices at our fort saskatchewan manufacturing plant 
subsequent to our second phase clinical trial results  we determined that a facility to manufacture npi  was not warranted at the time and decided not to proceed with the construction 
the design costs of million were written off in and recorded as a write down of capital assets in our consolidated statement of operations 
during  we determined that approximately million of capital equipment was obsolete 
the costs were written off in and recorded as a write down of capital assets in our consolidated statement of operations 
in the third quarter of  we substantially completed the plant expansion begun in we expect the expansion to be operational in the first quarter of no short term securities were purchased in whereas the most significant use of cash in was for the purchase of short term investments in the amount of million offset by maturity of short term investments of million 
no purchases or maturities of investments occurred in any other period prior to december  cash provided from used in financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash provided from used in financing activities resulted from proceeds from issuance of common shares as a result of exercises of stock options and from our initial public offering as well as funds paid to and received from westaim 
we had nominal proceeds from the issuance of common shares and from the exercises of stock options for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  net proceeds from our initial public offering in after fees and expenses  amounted to million 
payment of million was received from westaim for the year ended december  as compensation for our agreement to surrender a portion of the space we leased from westaim to facilitate the sale of their fort saskatchewan  alberta buildings in which we are a tenant 
no such payments were received in any previous year 
with no further debt owed to westaim after the january  conversion

we expect to continue to make investments in our product pipeline and to prepare for regulatory approval and commercial launch of new products 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and commercialize existing and future products 
we also expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses in the future  due in part to the legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses that we will incur as a result of being a public company  and expenses relating to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcements of patent and intellectual property rights 
we expect that our available cash resources and the revenue from our agreements with smith nephew  will be sufficient to support our current and expected operations  our product development initiatives  including additional pharmaceutical development capital equipment  for at least the next months 
however  we will likely be required to obtain additional financing within the next months or afterwards if our cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we decide to pursue new product development initiatives collaborations  acquisitions or strategies 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including sales performance of smith nephew s acticoat tm products  the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates and the occurrence of unexpected developments 
we may seek to raise additional financing through the sale of equity  equity related or debt securities or loans 
the sale of additional equity or equity related securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
debt financing will expose us to risks of leverage  including the risk that we may be unable to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due  and that we may be required to pledge our assets as collateral for any debt financing that we obtain 
moreover  additional financing may not be available at times  in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all  particularly because we have granted a first priority security interest in certain critical patents and other intellectual property to smith nephew 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when required  we may be forced to reduce the scope of  or delay or eliminate  some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities and we may also be required to reduce the scale of our operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
contractual commitments and obligations at december  the table below reports commitments and obligations that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  certain other obligations and commitments  while not required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be included in the consolidated balance sheets  may have a material impact on liquidity 
these items  all of which have been entered into in the ordinary course of business  are also included in the table below in order to present a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity 
cash payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in millions consolidated obligations and commitments as of december  facilities operating leases third parties contractual obligations third parties purchase obligations capital operations total obligations and commitments this commitment relates primarily to our obligation  under our supply agreement to pay smith nephew a manufacturing cost rebate in the amount of million in and 
table of contents related party transactions we obtain certain corporate and administrative services from westaim and we paid rent and operating expenses on our manufacturing facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta to westaim until westaim sold the buildings on may  our leases were assigned to the purchaser of such facility 
the total cost of the services  rent and operating expenses paid to westaim was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million in we have historically reimbursed westaim for the cost of providing or  in certain cases  for the cost of paying a third party to provide certain corporate and administrative services to us 
these services have included insurance and risk management  cash management  legal  human resources  payroll processing  environmental health and safety  tax and accounting and intellectual property services 
these costs have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
westaim continues to supply certain services to us pursuant to a services agreement which provides that we reimburse westaim for the fully allocated costs of providing or for the cost of paying a third party to provide those services 
during  our internal staff began to perform many of the services previously provided by westaim 
at december   we continue to receive insurance and risk management services and tax and accounting services from westaim 
with limited exceptions  we do not maintain any insurance policies in our own name 
instead  westaim provides insurance coverage to us under its policies  which cover westaim and other entities it controls  and we expect to have this coverage until the termination of the services agreement or that portion of it relating to the provision of insurance to us by westaim or until such time as westaim owns less than of our common shares 
we reimburse westaim for the costs of that coverage under the arrangements described earlier in this paragraph 
in the event we are no longer covered by westaim s insurance policies  we would have to obtain our own insurance policies  which could result in increased costs or reduced insurance coverage 
off balance sheet commitments as of december  as of december   our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included two facilities operating leases 
these items are not required to be recorded on our balance sheet under gaap 
they are disclosed in the table presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity as of december  our fort saskatchewan  alberta facility was originally rented from westaim under two separate leases covering a total of  square feet of space until may  when westaim sold the buildings and assigned the leases to the purchaser 
as part of that transaction  westaim paid us million as compensation for entering into agreements to amend the leases and our surrender of portions of the leased premises on or before september  on june   we entered into a lease surrender agreement with the purchaser pursuant to which we surrendered a portion of the leased premises and adjusted our rent and operating costs accordingly 
on september   we entered into a second lease surrender agreement with the purchaser pursuant to which we surrendered the final portion of the leased premises we had agreed to surrender and adjusted our rent and operating costs accordingly 
after two lease surrenders  the total space now covered under our leases assigned to the purchaser is  square feet 
our future minimum commitments under the fort saskatchewan  alberta lease are approximately million for each of the twelve month periods commencing from january  to the expiry of the lease 
our wakefield  massachusetts offices and laboratory facility are leased from a third party 
the lease term began on july  and will expire on july  there are options to extend for two terms of five years each 
our future minimum commitments under the wakefield  massachusetts lease are million for and million for and are included in the table presented above 
in the normal course of operations  we may provide indemnifications that are contractual terms to counterparties in transactions such as purchase and sale agreements  service agreements  director officer contracts and leasing transactions 
these indemnification agreements may require us to compensate the counterparties for costs incurred as a result of various events  such as litigation claims of statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction 
the terms of the indemnification agreements will vary based upon the agreement  the nature of which prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be required to pay counterparties 
historically  we have not made any payments under such indemnifications and no amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and useful lives of capital and intangible assets 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the methodology is consistent with prior years 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of products based upon our licensing and supply agreements with smith nephew in accordance with gaap 
the agreements provide for payment to us of manufacturing costs on a fixed price basis  and partial reimbursement of new product development costs  and for royalties and milestone payments 
we recognize chargeable manufacturing costs as revenue upon shipment of product from our manufacturing facility 
we record our royalty revenues upon the sale of products by smith nephew to its customers 
up to september   we were also eligible to earn additional royalties when specified gross margin thresholds have been achieved by smith nephew 
additional royalties are recognized by us in the period of sale by smith nephew to its customers 
after september   with the revision to the license and development agreement  we agreed to delete the obligation of smith nephew to pay additional royalties 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when smith nephew achieves the agreed sales levels or receives the agreed regulatory approvals 
revenue also includes reimbursement for costs and expenses we incur above a certain threshold in connection with the development of new products and improvements to products covered by our agreements with smith nephew 
our employees may perform work for smith nephew to develop new products and the revenue from such work is recognized in the period the work is performed 
research and development costs the cost of materials and equipment that are acquired or constructed for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred 
research and development expenditures  which include the cost of materials consumed in research and development activities  salaries  wages and other costs of personnel engaged in research and development  costs of services performed by others for research and development on behalf of us  depreciation on equipment used for research and development and indirect costs are expensed as research and development costs when incurred 
we have made  and continue to make  substantial investments in research and development activities to expand our product portfolio and grow our business 
income taxes we use the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that  in the opinion of management  is more likely than not to be realized 
the effect of changes in tax rates is recognized in the year in which the rate change occurs 
changes to these interpretations could have a material effect on income tax provisions in future periods 
intangible assets our definite life intangible assets consist of the prosecution and applications costs of patents and trademarks and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to a maximum of years 
the cost of maintaining patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred 
we assess the carrying value of definite life intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment in the carrying value is charged to expense in the period that impairment has been determined

year ended december  period end rate period average rate high rate low rate monthly january february march april may june july august september october november december stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment sfas r  which requires that all share based payments to directors and employees  including grants of stock options  be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which required the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was  which consisted of stock based compensation expense of related to director and employee stock options and related to rsus and sars  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital  or apic  of  and share capital of in addition  stock based compensation of was recognized related to restricted share units awarded to the independent directors 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  because the exercise price 
table of contents of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
sfas r requires that liability classified awards such as sars be revalued to estimated fair value at each reporting date using an option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we valued sars at the amount by which the market value exceeded the exercise price at each measurement date 
as a result of implementing sfas r on january   we increased our sar liability from to  with the increase recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model for valuation of share based payment awards which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common share price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee share option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including variability in currency exchange rates 
the smith nephew sales revenues on which our royalty and milestone revenues are determined are reported to us in us dollars 
sales by smith nephew in other currencies will result in fluctuations in their revenue as reported in us dollars 
the smith nephew contracts ensure recovery of certain manufacturing costs  which reduces our susceptibility to production cost variances resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations 
our accounts receivable from smith nephew are denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency that we use for accounting purposes is the canadian dollar and as a result  accounts receivable and other liabilities recorded in canadian dollars are exposed to changes in the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollars until these receivables are collected 
we do not maintain derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to currency risks as a result of our export to foreign jurisdictions of goods produced in canada 
these risks are partially covered by purchases of goods and services in the foreign currency 
for  a increase in the exchange rate from the united states dollar to the canadian dollar meaning a appreciation in the value of the united states dollar compared to the canadian dollar would have decreased our loss before income taxes by less than million 
conversely  a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our loss before taxes by a similar amount
