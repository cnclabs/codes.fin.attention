item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in the context of this overview 
general economic and industry wide factors general economic conditions presented extraordinary challenges in higher raw material costs and continued declines in the us housing and construction markets throughout fiscal and an overall global economic decline in the fourth quarter of negatively affected our results 
in  we experienced dramatic increases in the costs of raw materials in the u 
s and abroad  continuing a trend that began in the second half of fiscal although the price of crude oil trended downward in the fourth quarter of  we did not experience relief in our raw material costs in the quarter 
in response to increased raw material costs during the fiscal year  we were able to implement customer price increases to partially offset the cost increases 
total net sales increased from  primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rates  acquisitions and increased customer selling prices 
our acquisitions and international operations performed well in we continued to expand our global presence in by acquiring aries coil coatings sa de sa aries  a privately owned manufacturer of high performance coil and packaging coatings based in monterrey  mexico 
the us housing market continued its decline  and our wood coatings and architectural paints continue to be the product lines most affected by the downturn 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to see weakness in the commercial construction market 
our architectural product line  however  performed well in comparison to our competitors 
we believe this was due to increased brand awareness resulting from our continuing investment in the valspar and cabot brands 
at the end of  a crisis in the worldwide credit and financial sectors emerged  as well as a slowdown in the global economy 
business performance net sales increased to  from  in  primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rates  acquisitions and increased customer selling prices 
our global presence expanded as international net sales accounted for of our total business in  compared to in in december  we acquired control of aries coil coatings sa de cv aries  a privately owned manufacturer of high performance coil and packaging coatings based in monterrey  mexico 
we purchased the remaining shares of this business in the second quarter of aries had annual sales in calendar year of approximately  in january  we acquired a majority of the voting shares of a coil coatings business in brazil from tekno sa tekno s revenue for was  in the fourth quarter of  we acquired the remaining shares of this business 
we continue to invest in the valspar brand to support the long term growth of our paints segment by building a premium brand in the marketplace 
as a result  we have seen an increase in consumer awareness of the valspar brand 
in china  our huarun brand continues to experience growth 
during the third quarter of  we initiated a comprehensive series of actions to lower our cost structure and further increase our operational efficiency 
the total cost of these restructuring actions is expected to be to per share after tax 
approximately half of the total cost of our restructuring actions is related to streamlining our european operations 
we have reduced manufacturing capacity and our overall global head count to lower our costs in light of challenging global economic conditions 
restructuring activities during resulted in pre tax charges of  or per share after tax 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on restructuring 
during the year we generated  in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends  an increase of  from  and reduced our total debt  including notes payable  by  our liquidity position is strong  with  in cash and  unused committed bank credit facilities providing total committed liquidity of  at year end

however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  gross unrecognized tax benefits of  as of october   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
on november   we entered into a day  unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks maturing on november  this credit facility was subject to an option to extend for an additional year 
we exercised this option and borrowed  under this facility  which is now due november  we also have a  unsecured committed credit facility that expires in october under the terms of these credit facilities  we can borrow at optional interest rates of prime or libor based rates 
at october   we had unused lines of committed and uncommitted credit available from banks of  we believe cash flow from operations  existing lines of credit  access to credit facilities and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current and projected needs for financing 
in the current market conditions  despite the prevailing credit crisis  we have demonstrated continued access to these markets 
we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements 
our cash balances are primarily held by our international subsidiaries and are used to fund day to day operating needs 
those cash balances have also been used to finance acquisitions 
our investment policy on excess cash is to preserve principal 
we use derivative instruments with a number of counter parties principally to manage well defined interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
we evaluate the financial stability of each counterparty and spread the risk among many financial institutions to limit our exposure 
we will continue to monitor counterparty risk on an ongoing basis 
common stock dividends of  in represented a increase over the dividend in was increased to per share from per share in we have continuing authorization to purchase shares of our common stock at management s discretion for general corporate purposes 
shares repurchased in were  shares totaling  we repurchased  shares totaling  in we retired  of those shares in we repurchased  shares totaling  in we are involved in various claims relating to environmental and waste disposal matters at a number of current and former plant sites 
we engage or participate in remedial and other environmental compliance activities at certain of these sites 
at other sites  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste 
management analyzes each individual site  considering the number of parties involved  the level of potential liability or contribution by us relative to the other parties  the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved  the method and extent of remediation  the potential insurance coverage  the estimated legal and consulting expense with respect to each site  and the time period over which any costs would likely be incurred 
based on the above analysis  management estimates the remediation or other clean up costs and related claims for each site 
the estimates are based in part on discussions with other prps  governmental agencies and engineering firms 

table of contents we accrue appropriate reserves for potential environmental liabilities  which are continually reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
while uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of our ultimate environmental liabilities  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that such liabilities  individually and in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in a variety of legal claims and proceedings relating to personal injury  product liability  warranties  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these claims and proceedings include cases where we are one of a number of defendants in proceedings alleging that the plaintiffs suffered injuries or contracted diseases from exposure to chemicals or other ingredients used in the production of some of our products or waste disposal 
we believe these claims and proceedings are not out of the ordinary course for a business of the type and size in which we are engaged 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that the costs and liabilities of such matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable revenue recognition other than extended furniture protection plans  revenue from sales is recognized at the time of product delivery  passage of title  a sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in revenue as the products are sold 
we sell extended furniture protection plans for which revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract 
an actuarial study utilizing historical claims data is used to forecast claims payments over the contract period  and revenue is recognized based on the forecasted claims payments 
actual claims costs are reflected in earnings in the period incurred 
anticipated losses on programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
supplier and customer rebates we record supplier and customer rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold or a reduction to revenue  respectively  as they are earned  in accordance with the underlying agreement 
the customer rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the customer s purchases 
customer rebates that increase based on different levels of sales volume are recognized immediately when the current activity plus expected volume triggers a higher earned rebate 
the supplier rebate estimate is developed based on contractual terms of our current purchasing activity 
supplier rebates that increase based on different levels of purchases are recognized when there is certainty that the current level of purchases will trigger a higher rebate earned 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists and relationships  purchased technology and patents and trademarks 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill for each reporting unit be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we have five reporting units as of october  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed by sfas in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  we would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 

table of contents management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
if the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value 
in assessing fair value  management generally utilizes a relief from royalty method 
during the fourth quarters of and  management completed the annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
the discount rate and sales growth assumptions are the two material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we utilize a cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets have historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets by a substantial amount 
we perform a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and revenue growth assumptions 
either the discount rate could increase by of the discount rate utilized or the sales growth assumption could decline to a zero growth environment and our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair value in excess of carrying value 
pension and post retirement medical obligations we sponsor several defined benefit plans for certain hourly and salaried employees 
we also sponsor post retirement medical benefits for certain us employees 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans in accordance with gaap  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical trend rates and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense  in a increase in the medical trend rates would not have a material effect on post retirement medical expense or the post retirement benefit obligation 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further details regarding accounting for pensions and post retirement medical benefits 
at october  the fair value of the assets held by the pension plan was approximately  reflecting a decline of approximately  due primarily to the significant decline in the stock markets since our measurement date for our pension plans of july  assuming no significant recovery in the stock prices or a significant contribution prior to the end of fiscal year  we will be required to increase our recorded liability for the net underfunded status of our pension plans and we would expect pension expense in fiscal year to increase from fiscal year further  a decline in value of our pension assets could necessitate accelerated and higher cash contributions to our pension plans 
such amounts are not currently quantifiable because our required liability and the valuation of our pension plans assets will occur at the end of fiscal income taxes at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

table of contents forward looking statements certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
these forward looking statements are based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
any statement that is not historical in nature is a forward looking statement and may be identified by the use of words and phrases such as expects  anticipates  believes  will  will likely result  will continue  plans to and similar expressions 
these uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  changes in general economic conditions both domestic and international  including recessions and other external economic and political factors  which may adversely affect our business  the value of our investments  the financial stability of our customers and suppliers and our ability to obtain financing  dependence of internal earnings growth on economic conditions and growth in the domestic and international coatings industry  competitive factors including pricing pressure and product competition  risks related to any future acquisitions  including risks of adverse changes in the results of acquired businesses and the assumption of unforeseen liabilities  risks of disruptions in business resulting from the integration process and higher interest costs resulting from further borrowing for any such acquisitions  our reliance on the efforts of vendors  government agencies  utilities and other third parties to achieve adequate compliance and avoid disruption of our business  risks of disruptions in business resulting from our relationships with customers and suppliers  risks and uncertainties associated with operations and achievement of growth in developing markets  including china and central and south america  unusual weather conditions adversely affecting sales  changes in raw materials pricing and availability  delays in passing along cost increases to customers  changes in governmental regulation  including more stringent environmental  health and safety regulations  changes in accounting policies and standards and taxation requirements such as new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations  the nature  cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings  civil unrest and the outbreak of war and other significant national and international events  and other risks and uncertainties 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive  and we disclaim any obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk portions of our sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we have not hedged our exposure to translation gains and losses  however  we have reduced our exposure by borrowing funds in local currencies 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we are also subject to interest rate risk 
at october   approximately of our total debt consisted of floating rate debt 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a increase in interest rates from those in effect on october  would not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position
