item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors  forward looking statements for information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business  securities  financial condition or operating results  reference is made to the disclosure set forth under item a above under the caption risk factors 
in addition  because the following discussion includes numerous forward looking statements relating to us  our results of operations and financial condition and business  reference is made to the information set forth above in item under the caption important factors relating to forward looking statements 
overview we are primarily engaged in the production  grading  packing  and sale of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was may  weeks  june  weeks  and june  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
at our facilities we hatch chicks  grow pullets  manufacture feed  and produce  process  and distribute shell eggs 
we currently are the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the united states 
shell eggs accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal egg products accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal and in fiscal we primarily market our shell eggs in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
shell eggs are sold directly by us primarily to national and regional supermarket chains 
we currently use contract producers for approximately of our total egg production 
contract producers operate under agreements with us for the use of their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we also own the eggs produced 
also  shell eggs are purchased  as needed  for resale by us from outside producers 
our operating income or loss is significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which can fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in egg production during the spring and early summer 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs  which currently averages about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in feed costs result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of feed ingredients is affected by a number of supply and demand factors such as crop production and weather  and other factors  such as the level of grain exports  over which we have little or no control 
the purchase of hillandale  llc  aep and hillandale farms  llc described above in part  item  is collectively referred to below as the hillandale purchase

per dozen for fiscal to per dozen for fiscal  an increase of 
per dozen  or 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which are outside of our control 
small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices 
egg supply has been better balanced with demand resulting in favorable egg market conditions 
according to statistics from the usda  the number of table egg laying hens was down from the previous year  which added continued support in balancing supply and demand in the shell egg market 
improved balancing of supply and demand  led to higher average shell egg selling prices throughout the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the previous year 
we continue to increase our sales volume of specialty eggs  which include reduced cholesterol  cage free and organic eggs 
specialty egg retail prices are less cyclical than standard shell egg prices and are generally higher due to consumer willingness to pay for the increased benefits from these products 
for fiscal  specialty eggs accounted for of shell egg dollar sales  as compared to in fiscal and of shell egg dozens sold in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal this fiscal year our egg product sales were million  an increase of million or  as compared to million for fiscal our consolidated net sales include the sales of egg products by aep and texas egg products  llc

as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  texas egg products  llc is a variable interest entity for which the company is the primary beneficiary 
texas egg products  llc began operations in fiscal  and we consolidated weeks of activity for fiscal  as compared to weeks in fiscal our net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs  including non graded shell egg sales  breaking stock and undergrades 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of costs directly related to production and processing of shell eggs  including feed costs  and purchases of shell eggs from outside egg producers 
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended may  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to cost of sales of million for fiscal on a comparable basis  dozens produced decreased  dozens purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased and cost of feed ingredients increased in fiscal the cost of the shell eggs purchased from outside producers increased due to improved egg market selling prices 
this fiscal year we produced of the eggs sold by us  as compared to for the previous year 
feed cost for fiscal was 
per dozen  compared to 
per dozen for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
higher than average egg selling prices  more than offset the increase in feed ingredient costs and higher costs of purchases from outside egg producers  resulting in an increase in gross profit from of net sales for fiscal to of net sales for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing  distribution  accounting and corporate overhead 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increases of million in franchise fees for specialty egg sales  million in our equity compensation plan expense  million in administrative payroll expenses  million in employee insurance costs   for commissions paid to egg brokers  with delivery costs slightly up with an increase of  the expense recognized in connection with our stock based compensation plans is dependent on the price of the company s common stock  which increased from at june  to at may  overall  delivery costs increased slightly  due to continued reduction in the number of company long haul trucks and the increased use of contract trucking 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal operating income loss 
as a result of the above  our operating income was million for fiscal  as compared to operating income of million for fiscal the operating income as a percent of sales for fiscal was  as compared to operating income of for fiscal other income expense 
other income or expense consists of income or costs not directly charged or related to operations such as equity in income of affiliates and interest expense 
other income for fiscal was million as compared to other expense of million for fiscal  an increase of million 
we had lower average long term borrowing balances and higher invested cash balances  which decreased net interest expense 
other income increased due to increased equity in income of affiliates  which are also in the shell egg business 
gains recorded on the sale of property  plant  equipment  which includes the sale of our feed mill in albuquerque  nm  also increased other income 
our net interest expense includes the computation of non cash interest expense  which is imputed on our non interest bearing obligation to acquire the remaining membership units of hillandale  llc over the remaining acquisition period culminating with us having a ownership interest in hillandale  llc 
as a percent of net sales  other income was

our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which are outside of our control 
small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices 
during fiscal  consumer demand increased  partially due to the popularity of high protein diets 
egg producers increased egg supply to meet consumer demand 
during our second fiscal quarter  consumer demand decreased to normal levels 
at the same time  egg supply continued at the higher levels and resulted in a drop in egg selling prices for the remainder of fiscal during fiscal  consumer demand improved slightly  but egg supply continued at higher levels 
during fiscal  consumer demand remained steady  but egg supply was lower  which resulted in stronger egg prices 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of costs directly related to production and processing of shell eggs  including feed costs  and purchases of shell eggs from outside egg producers 
cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to cost of sales of million for fiscal on a comparable basis  dozens produced decreased  dozens purchased from outside shell egg producers increased and cost of feed ingredients increased in fiscal the cost of the shell eggs purchased from outside producers increased due to improved egg market selling prices

selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing  distribution  accounting and corporate overhead 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of million in franchise fees for specialty egg sales  and an increase of million in our equity compensation plan expense  with an overall decrease in delivery costs 
the cost of the stock based compensation plans is dependent on the price of the company s common stock  which increased from at june  to at june  overall  delivery costs have decreased  due to a reduction in the number of company long haul trucks  increased back haul loads and the increased use of contract trucking 
selling  general and administrative expense was

other income or expense consists of income or costs not directly charged or related to operations such as equity in income of affiliates and interest expense 
other expense for fiscal was million as compared to other expense of million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased by million  due to lower average long term debt balances 
in fiscal  we reduced interest expense by capitalizing  of interest in connection with the construction of egg products and spent hen processing facilities in waelder  tx 
the non cash interest expense  as explained below  decreased by  the reduction of other expense is attributable primarily to the increase in net income of affiliates 
the non cash expense is imputed on our non interest bearing obligation to acquire the remaining membership units of hillandale  llc s over the remaining acquisition period culminating with us having a interest in hillandale  llc 
as a percent of net sales  other expense was 
for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal income taxes

net income 
as a result of the above  net income for fiscal was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share for fiscal capital resources and liquidity 
our working capital at may  was million compared to million at june  our current ratio was at may  as compared with at june  our need for working capital generally is highest in the first and second fiscal quarters ending in august and november 
during the first quarter shell egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
in the second quarter  we usually build inventory balances in anticipation of the holiday season 
seasonal borrowing needs frequently are higher during these periods than during other fiscal periods 
we have a million line of credit with three banks  million of which was utilized as a standby letter of credit at may  our long term debt at that date  including current maturities  totaled million  as compared to million at june  for the fiscal year ended may   million in net cash was provided by operating activities 
this compares to million of net cash provided for the fiscal year ended june  in fiscal  million was used for purchases of property  plant and equipment  which includes million in expenditures in connection with construction of our facilities in farwell  tx 
net cash of million was used for investments and  received on notes receivable

as part of our stock option plan  approximately  was received for sales of common stock from the treasury  and million was used for payments of dividends on our common stock 
payments of million were made on long term debt 
in accord with the hillandale  llc purchase agreement  we made payments of million on our long term purchase obligation 
the net result was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended june   million in net cash was provided by operating activities 
this compares to million of net cash provided for the fiscal year ended june  in fiscal  million was used for acquisition of businesses  million was used for purchases of property  plant and equipment

proceeds from long term borrowings of million were received and payments of million were made on long term debt 
in accord with the hillandale  llc purchase agreement  we made a payment of million on our long term purchase obligation 
the net result was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
substantially all trade receivables and inventories collateralize our revolving line of credit and most of our property  plant and equipment collateralize our long term debt under our loan agreements with our lenders 
unless otherwise approved by our lenders  we are required by provisions of these loan agreements to maintain minimum levels of working capital ratio of not less than to and net worth minimum of million tangible net worth adjusted for earnings  limit capital expenditures less exclusions not to exceed million for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters  lease obligations and additional long term borrowings total funded debt to total capitalization not to exceed  and maintain various cash flow coverage ratios to  among other restrictions 
at may   we were in compliance with the provisions of all loan agreements 
under certain of the loan agreements  the lenders have the option to require the prepayment of any outstanding borrowings in the event we undergo a change in control 
under the terms of our agreement with hillandale and the hillandale shareholders  a new florida limited liability company named hillandale  llc was formed 
in fiscal  we purchased of the units of membership in hillandale  llc  with the remaining units to be acquired in essentially equal annual installments over a four year period 
the purchase price of the units is equal to their book value as calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
in fiscal  we purchased  pursuant to the agreement  an additional of the units of membership for million from our cash balances 
in fiscal  we purchased an additional of the units of membership for million from our cash balances 
during fiscal  an early payment of million was paid on the purchase obligation 
we have recorded the obligation to acquire the remaining at its estimated present value of million at may  the actual remaining purchase price may be higher or lower when the acquisitions are completed 
future funding is expected to be provided by our cash balances and borrowings 
during fiscal  the company revised the estimated purchase obligation upward for the remaining interest to be acquired in hillandale  llc  based on the effect of the expected earnings increase on the book value of the membership units 
this additional cost exceeded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired by  which has been assigned to goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets 
capital expenditure requirements are expected to be for the normal repair and replacement of our facilities 
in addition  we are constructing a new integrated layer production complex in west texas to replace our albuquerque  new mexico complex  which has ceased egg production 
the expected cost is approximately million 
completion of this facility is estimated to be in january as of may  capital expenditures related to construction of this complex were million 
the remaining future capital expenditures will be funded by cash flows from operations  existing lines of credit and additional long term borrowings 
as of may   we were a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of delta egg farm  llc  an unconsolidated affiliate located in delta  utah 
delta egg farm  llc is constructing an organic egg production and distribution facility near chase  kansas 
the cost of construction is estimated to be approximately million 
in connection with this project  we are a pro rata guarantor  with the other delta egg farm  llc owners  of additional debt undertaken to fund construction of this facility 
with the inclusion of the original amount of debt for which we were a guarantor at may   we are currently a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of delta egg farm  llc 
at may   the company held auction rate securities ars with a cost of million and an estimated fair value of million 
these securities may be purchased or sold through an auction process in short term intervals  which on average range from days  whereby the interest rate on the security is reset 
a variety of financial market related credit issues challenged the liquidity within this investment arena  and resulted in a number of failed auction sell orders 
we have designated these investments as available for sale securities and have accounted for them in accordance with the standards of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for certain investments debt and equity securities 
at may   we determined that cost did not approximate fair value and recorded an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the determination was also made that these assets should be reclassified as noncurrent available for sale securities 
we are not certain how long we may be required to hold each security 
however  given our current cash position  liquid cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and our borrowing capacity under our line of credit  we believe the current and near term illiquidity of the auction rate securities will not adversely affect management s ability to achieve its operating goals 
subsequent to our fiscal year ending may   we did liquidate one ars at par value for million with accrued interest after this security was called on july  by the original issuer 
we currently have a million deferred tax liability due to a subsidiary s change from a cash basis to an accrual basis taxpayer on may  the taxpayer relief act of provides that this liability is payable ratably over the years beginning in fiscal however  such taxes will be due in their entirety in the first fiscal year in which there is a change in ownership control so that we no longer qualify as a family farming corporation 
we are currently making annual payments of approximately  related to this liability 
however  while these current payments reduce cash balances  payment of the million deferred tax liability would not impact our consolidated statement of operations or stockholders equity  as these taxes have been accrued and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
looking forward  we believe that our current cash balances  borrowing capacity  utilization of our revolving line of credit  and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our current and projected capital needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under securities and exchange commission regulations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments  in thousands  to be made under existing contractual obligations 
further information on debt obligations is contained in note  and on lease obligations in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table includes the obligation incurred by us for the hillandale acquisition  which is subject to change  because the exact amounts of which are to be determined under the terms of the agreement 
at the closing of the hillandale transaction on october   we purchased of the units of membership in hillandale  llc 
in august  in accordance with the agreement  we purchased  for million  an additional of the units of hillandale  llc based on their book value as of july  in august  we purchased  for million  an additional of the units of hillandale  llc based on their book value as of july  our ownership of hillandale  llc currently is 
we will incur costs for our purchase of the remaining of the units of membership over the remaining two years  which will culminate with us having a equity interest in hillandale  llc 
our obligation to acquire the remaining of hillandale  llc is recorded at its present value of million as of may  of which million is included in current liabilities and million is included in other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
this estimated obligation was adjusted during fiscal due to the effect of the expected earnings increase on the book value of the membership units 
the company will adjust the original hillandale purchase price allocation based on the ultimate amount paid for the acquisition in accordance with sfas total over years long term debt purchase obligation operating leases total impact of recently issued accounting standards 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective june  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption or at may  accordingly  we do not have any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
however  if interest or penalties were to be incurred related to uncertain tax positions  such amounts would be recognized in income tax expense 
tax periods for all years after remain open to examination by the federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no  fair value measurements fas 
fas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and expands on required disclosures about fair value measurement 
fas is effective for us on june  and will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities fas  to permit all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
fas is effective for us on june  and will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  or r  business combinations fas r 
fas r retained the fundamental requirements in fas that the acquisition method of accounting which fas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified or each business combination 
fas r  which is broader in scope than that of fas  which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration  applies the same method of accounting the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
fas r also makes certain other modifications to fas this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which will begin with our fiscal year 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the company is currently assessing the effect fas r may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas amends arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as minority interest  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
among other requirements  this statement requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
fas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   which will begin with our fiscal year 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the company is currently assessing the effect fas may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests that our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories 
inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets 
depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates 
we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to 
therefore  these investments are recorded using the cost or the equity method  and accordingly  not consolidated in our financial statements 
changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used 
our investment in these companies amounted to million at may  the combined total assets and total liabilities of these companies were approximately million and million  respectively  at may  we are a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of one of the affiliates 
goodwill 
at may   our goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill relates to the fiscal acquisition of hudson brothers  inc  the fiscal acquisition of hillandale farms  llc  and the fiscal acquisition of green forest foods  llc 
we adopted  as of june   statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
an impairment loss would be recorded if the recorded goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we have only one operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment at the entity level 
significant adverse industry or economic changes  or other factors not anticipated could result in an impairment charge to reduce recorded goodwill 
income taxes 
we determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we are periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate 
forward looking statements 
the foregoing statements contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties and our actual experience may differ materially from that discussed above 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors affecting future performance below  as well as future events that have the effect of reducing our available cash balances  such as unanticipated operating losses or capital expenditures related to possible future acquisitions 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update forward looking statements 
factors affecting future performance 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors which are beyond our control 
these include adverse changes in shell egg prices and in the grain markets 
accordingly  past trends should not be used to anticipate future results and trends 
further  our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain certain of our debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a adverse move decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the net fair value of our debt by million at may  we are exposed to risk related to our investments in auction rate securities 
liquidity for these securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually on average every days 
because of the short interest rate reset period  we have historically recorded them as current available for sale securities 
the liquidity of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
these securities had been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates 
we will not be able to liquidate any of our auction rate securities until a future auction is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the notes are redeemed 
an auction failure  which is not a default in the underlying debt instrument  occurs when there are more sellers than buyers at a scheduled interest rate auction date and parties desiring to sell their securities are unable to do so 
if the credit market does not improve  auctions for our invested amounts may continue to fail 
if an auction fails for securities in which we have invested  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par  should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
in the event we need or desire to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par  we may incur a loss 
furthermore  if the issuers of the auction rate securities are unable to successfully complete future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments by recording an impairment charge 
there is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize 
the fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets 
if conditions in the credit markets deteriorate further causing additional auctions to fail  the funds associated with these auction rate securities may also not be accessible for an undetermined period of time  and we may be required to record losses or an impairment charge on our auction rate securities portfolio in future quarters  which would harm our financial condition 
we are a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
