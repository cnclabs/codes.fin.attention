item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those we discuss under risks related to our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
general we are a leading provider of enterprise software applications and related services to the education industry 
our clients use our software to integrate technology into the education experience and campus life  and to support activities such as a professor assigning digital materials on a class website  a student collaborating with peers or completing research online  an administrator managing a departmental website  a principal sending mass communications via voice  email and text messages to parents and students  or a merchant conducting cash free transactions with students and faculty through pre funded debit accounts 
our clients include colleges  universities  schools and other education providers  textbook publishers  student focused merchants  and corporate and government clients 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the nti group  inc for a purchase price of million in cash and million in our common stock  which equated to approximately million shares of our common stock  with up to an additional million shares of our common stock contingent on the achievement of certain performance milestones 
in connection with the transaction  we paid a portion of the purchase price using proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
this acquisition will give us the opportunity to offer clients the ability to send mass communications via voice  email and text messages 
we acquired the technology underlying blackboard connect  which we began offering in february  through the acquisition of the nti group  inc we generate revenues from sales and licensing of products and from professional services 
our product revenues consist principally of revenues from annual software licenses  client hosting engagements and the sale of bundled software hardware systems 
we typically sell our licenses and hosting services under annually renewable agreements  and our clients generally pay the annual fees at the beginning of the contract term 
we recognize revenues from these agreements  as well as revenues from bundled software hardware systems  which do not recur  ratably over the contractual term  which is typically months 
billings associated with licenses and hosting services are recorded initially as deferred revenues and then recognized ratably into revenues over the contract term 
we also generate product revenues from the sale and licensing of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with our software 
these revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of the products to our clients 
we derive professional services revenues primarily from training  implementation  installation and other consulting services 
substantially all of our professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we recognize these revenues as the services are performed 
we typically license our individual applications either on a stand alone basis or bundled as part of our product suites  the blackboard academic suite tm  the blackboard commerce suite tm and blackboard connect tm 
the blackboard academic suite includes the products formerly known as webct campus edition tm and webct vista tm  which were acquired in our merger with webct  inc webct 
we generally price our software licenses on the basis of full time equivalent students or users 
accordingly  annual license fees are generally greater for larger institutions 
our operating expenses consist of cost of product revenues  cost of professional services revenues  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
major components of our cost of product revenues include license and other fees that we owe to third parties upon licensing software  and the cost of hardware that we bundle with our software 
we initially defer these costs and recognize them into expense over the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization of internally developed technology available for sale  employee compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for personnel supporting our hosting  support and production functions  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities  depreciation expense and cost of external professional services used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of third party software and hardware that is not bundled with software are also expensed when incurred  normally upon delivery to our client 
cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
cost of professional services revenues primarily includes the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees and external consultants who are involved in the performance of professional services engagements for our clients  as well as travel and related costs  facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the creation and testing of the products we offer  as well as the costs of external professional services  travel and related costs attributable to the creation and testing of our products  related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses include the costs of compensation  including bonuses and commissions  stock based compensation and benefits for employees who are associated with the generation of revenues  as well as marketing expenses  costs of external marketing related professional services  investor relations  facility rent  utilities  communications  travel attributable to those sales and marketing employees in the generation of revenues and bad debt expense 
all of these costs are expensed as incurred 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of compensation  stock based compensation and benefits for employees in the human resources  legal  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  executive management and other administrative functions that are not directly associated with the generation of revenues or the creation and testing of products 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include the costs of external professional services and insurance  as well as related facility rent  communication costs  utilities and depreciation expense used in these functions 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of costs associated with products  acquired technology  customer lists  non compete agreements and other identifiable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were recorded at the time of our acquisitions and relate to contractual agreements  technology and products that we continue to utilize in our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
during the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  fixed assets  long lived assets  including purchase accounting and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from two sources product sales and professional services sales 
product revenues include software license  hardware  premium support and maintenance  and hosting revenues 
professional services revenues include training and consulting services 
we recognize software license and maintenance revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software does not require significant modification and customization services 
where services are not essential to the functionality of the software  we begin to recognize software licensing revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our support and maintenance separate from our software for the majority of our products 
accordingly  when licenses are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance  we recognize the license revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we do have vsoe of fair value for our support and maintenance separate from our software for certain offerings 
accordingly  when licenses of these products are sold in conjunction with our support and maintenance  we recognize the license revenue upon delivery of the license and recognize the support and maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance service period 
we sell hardware in two types of transactions sales of hardware in conjunction with our software licenses  which we refer to as bundled hardware software systems  and sales of hardware without software  which generally involve the resale of third party hardware 
after any necessary installation services are performed  hardware revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we have not determined vsoe of the fair value for the separate components of bundled hardware software systems 
accordingly  when a bundled hardware software system is sold  all revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance service period 
hardware sales without software are recognized upon delivery of the hardware to our client 
hosting revenues are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
accordingly  we recognize hosting fees and set up fees ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
our sales arrangements may include professional services sold separately under professional services agreements that include training and consulting services 
revenues from these arrangements are accounted for separately from the license revenue because they meet the criteria for separate accounting  as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the professional services  such as consideration of whether the professional services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of professional services from other vendors and timing of payments 
professional services that are sold separately from license revenue are recognized as the professional services are performed on a time and materials basis 
we do not offer specified upgrades or incrementally significant discounts 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenues until the product is shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met and the revenue can be recognized 
deferred revenues represent the excess of amounts invoiced over amounts recognized as revenues 
we provide non specified upgrades of our product only on a when and if available basis 
any contingencies  such as rights of return  conditions of acceptance  warranties and price protection  are accounted for under sop the effect of accounting for these contingencies included in revenue arrangements has not been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
short term investments 
all investments with original maturities of greater than days are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we determine the appropriate classification at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity under the effective interest method 
such amortization is recorded as interest income 
interest on held to maturity securities is recorded as interest income 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses  if any  reported in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are recorded as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
long lived assets 
we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate these assets by examining estimated future cash flows to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
we evaluate these cash flows by using weighted probability techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
goodwill and intangible assets 
as the result of acquisitions  any excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions may be subject to change 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually on october  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  by comparing its fair value to its carrying value 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business  and a variety of other circumstances 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we are required to record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill is appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
the costs of defending and protecting patents are capitalized 
all costs incurred to the point when a patent application is to be filed are expensed as incurred 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets acquired technology years contracts and customer lists to years non compete agreements term of agreement trademarks and domain names years patents and related costs life of patent as of december  and  we had capitalized million and million  respectively  in costs of defending and protecting patents  due to expenses incurred in a suit against desirelearn  inc in which we have alleged infringement of one of our patents 
any change in our estimates based on ongoing litigation could materially reduce the valuation of these assets 
on february   we completed our merger with webct pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of october  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of webct in a cash transaction for approximately million 
the effective cash purchase price of webct before transaction costs was approximately million  net of webct s february  cash balance of approximately million 
we have included the financial results of webct in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of february  the total purchase price was million  including the acquisition related transaction costs of approximately million 
acquisition related transaction costs include investment banking  legal and accounting fees  and other external costs directly related to the merger 
of the total purchase price  million has been allocated to net tangible assets and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets of million consist of the value assigned to webct s customer relationships of million and developed and core technology of million 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we allocated million to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 
during  we reduced goodwill by approximately million primarily related to the recognition of deferred tax assets related to certain acquisition related transaction costs that were deductible for income tax purposes by webct 
consequently  after this adjustment  the net deferred tax asset acquired as a result of the webct merger was million 
during  we purchased technology for million which will provide future functionality in our products 
the technology is classified as acquired technology and recorded as intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  on november   we completed our merger with xythos software  inc xythos pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of november  xythos owns the underlying technology embedded in the blackboard content system 
this merger will give us the ability to further augment the underlying technology of the blackboard content system and is a technology that we intend to incorporate into the broader academic suite 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of xythos in a cash transaction for approximately million  including acquisition related transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments of million  which included a million reduction of deferred cost of revenues associated with the remaining value of the preexisting agreement with xythos 
we determined that their was no settlement gain or loss on the settlement of the preexisting agreement with xythos as the preexisting agreement was considered cancelable on its existing terms 
the million adjustment was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
the effective cash purchase price of xythos before transaction costs was approximately million  net of xythos s november  cash balance of approximately million 
we have included the financial results of xythos in our consolidated financial statements beginning november  the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values as of november  of the total purchase price  million has been allocated to net tangible assets and million has been allocated to definite lived intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets of million consist of the value assigned to xythos s customer relationships of million and developed and core technology of million 
we allocated million to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
income tax provision includes us federal  state and local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
the provision or benefit for income taxes is based upon our estimate of our annual effective income tax rate 
in determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate  we analyze various factors  including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local and foreign income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
all tax years since are subject to examination 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of million in the unrecognized tax benefit liability  which was accounted for as an increase to the january  accumulated deficit balance 
prior to adoption of fin  accruals for tax contingencies were provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we believe we had appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns for those years  we had recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of those positions 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method on january  under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all equity based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all equity based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our loss before benefit for income taxes and net loss for the year ended december  were approximately million and million more  respectively  than if we had not adopted sfas r 
our income before provision for income taxes and net income for the year ended december  were approximately million and million less  respectively  than if we had not adopted sfas r 
basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december  were each approximately more than if we had not adopted sfas r 
basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended december  were approximately and less  respectively  than if we had not adopted sfas r 
the related total income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and are classified as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under our option plans 
the cost is expected to be recognized through february with a weighted average recognition period of approximately years 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb agreed to delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits all entities to choose to elect  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date  and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
sfas applies to fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted for an entity that has also elected to apply the provisions of sfas an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying sfas  unless it chooses early adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas no 
requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
its intention is to eliminate the diversity in practice regarding the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  a revised version of sfas no 
 business combinations 
the revision is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under us generally accepted accounting principles with international accounting standards 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and may affect the release of our valuation allowance against prior acquisition intangibles 
an entity may not apply it before that date 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of the revision on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the use of a simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla stock options in accordance with sfas r 
the use of the simplified method  which was first described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 was scheduled to expire on december  sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
the sec staff does not expect the simplified method to be used when sufficient information regarding exercise behavior  such as historical exercise data or exercise information from external sources  becomes available 
sab is effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sab on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
important factors considered by management we consider several factors in evaluating both our financial position and our operating performance 
these factors  while primarily focused on relevant financial information  also include other measures such as general market and economic conditions  competitor information and the status of the regulatory environment 
to understand our financial results  it is important to understand our business model and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting for the majority of our contracts requires us to initially record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet upon invoicing the sale and then to recognize revenue in subsequent periods ratably over the term of the contract in our consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  to better understand our operations  one must look at both revenues and deferred revenues 
in evaluating our revenues  we analyze them in three categories recurring ratable revenues  non recurring ratable revenues and other revenues 
recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year  and that recur each year assuming clients renew their contracts 
these revenues include revenues from the licensing of all of our software products  hosting arrangements and enhanced support and maintenance contracts related to our software products  including certain professional services performed by our professional services groups 
non recurring ratable revenues include those product revenues that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year  but that do not contractually recur 
these revenues include certain hardware components of our blackboard transaction system products and certain third party hardware and software sold to our clients in conjunction with our software licenses 
other revenues include those revenues that are recognized as earned and are not deferred to future periods 
these revenues include professional services  the sales of blackboard one  certain sales of licenses  as well as the supplies and commissions we earn from publishers related to digital course supplement downloads 
in the case of both recurring ratable revenues and non recurring ratable revenues  an increase or decrease in the revenues in one period would be attributable primarily to increases or decreases in sales in prior periods 
unlike recurring ratable revenues  which benefit both from new license sales and from the renewal of previously existing licenses  non recurring ratable revenues primarily reflect one time sales that do not contractually renew 
other factors that we consider in making strategic cash flow and operating decisions include cash flows from operations  capital expenditures  total operating expenses and earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues product professional services total revenues operating expenses cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions total operating expenses operating margin the following table sets forth  for each component of revenues  the cost of these revenues expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  cost of product revenues cost of professional services revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to total revenues of million for the year ended december  a detail of our total revenues by classification is as follows product professional product professional revenues services revenues total revenues services revenues total in millions unaudited recurring ratable revenues non recurring ratable revenues other revenues total revenues product revenues 
product revenues  including domestic and international  for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  recurring ratable product revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from blackboard academic suite enterprise products which was attributable to current and prior period sales to new and existing clients  the continued shift of our existing clients from the blackboard learning system basic products to the blackboard learning system enterprise products and the cross selling of other enterprise products to existing clients 
the blackboard learning system enterprise products have additional functionality that is not available in the blackboard learning system basic products and consequently some blackboard learning system basic product clients upgrade to the blackboard learning system enterprise products 
licenses of the enterprise version of the blackboard learning system enterprise products have higher average pricing  which normally results in at least twice the contractual value as compared to blackboard learning system basic product licenses 
the further increase in recurring ratable product revenues was due to a million increase in hosting revenues and a million increase in revenues from the blackboard commerce suite related to an increase in revenues from blackboard transaction system licenses 
the remaining increase in recurring ratable product revenues resulted from increases in revenues from our other software products 
the revenues were reduced due to the fair value adjustment to the acquired webct deferred revenue balances in purchase accounting subsequent to the closing of the webct merger 
the increase in non recurring ratable product revenues was primarily due to an increase in sales of blackboard commerce suite hardware products 
the increase in other product revenues was primarily due to a million increase in sales related to certain product offerings of our content management software products  a million increase in third party hardware and software revenues  a million increase in blackboard one revenues due to an increase in current period sales and the remaining increase in other product revenues resulted primarily from increases in revenues from publisher relationships 
of our total revenues  our total international revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  international product revenues  which consist primarily of recurring ratable product revenues  were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in international recurring ratable product revenues was primarily due to an increase in international revenues from blackboard academic suite enterprise products resulting from prior period sales to new and existing clients 
in addition  the increase in international revenues also reflects our investment in increasing the size of our international sales force and international marketing efforts during prior periods  which expanded our international presence and enabled us to sell more of our products to new and existing clients in our international markets 
professional services revenues 
professional services revenues for the year ended december   were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in professional services was primarily attributable to an increase in the number and size of service engagements  which was directly related to the increase in the number of enterprise product licensees  which generally purchase greater volumes of our service offerings 
as a percentage of total revenues  professional services revenues for the year ended december  were as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments to webct s beginning deferred revenue balances subsequent to the closing of the webct merger during cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of product revenues was primarily due to a million increase in expenses related to hosting services due to the increase in the number of clients contracting for new hosting services or existing clients expanding their existing hosting arrangements 
further  the increase was due to a million increase in our technical support expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs related to increased headcount related to new hires during and higher average salaries due to annual salary increases in the results for the year ended december  included twelve months of expenses related to the acquired webct operations as compared to the year ended december  which only included ten months of expenses related to the acquired webct operations following the completion of the merger on february  the further increase in cost of product revenues was due to a million increase in hardware and software costs primarily associated with third party products sold with the blackboard transaction system 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase in product revenues margin was due primarily to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments to webct s beginning deferred revenue balances subsequent to the closing of the webct merger during cost of product revenues excludes amortization of acquired technology resulting from acquisitions  which is included as amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
amortization expense related to acquired technology was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cost of product revenues  including amortization of acquired technology  as a percentage of product revenues was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the results for the year ended december  included twelve months of amortization expense related to amortization of acquired technology resulting from the webct merger as compared to the year ended december   which only included ten months of amortization expense following the completion of the merger on february  cost of professional services revenues 
our cost of professional services revenues for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the results for the year ended december  included twelve months of expenses related to the acquired webct operations as compared to the year ended december   which only included ten months of expenses related to the acquired webct operations following the completion of the merger on february  cost of professional services revenues as a percentage of professional services revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in professional services revenues margin was due to the increase in revenues from higher margin service offerings during the year ended december  research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in professional services costs resulting from our continued efforts to increase the functionality of our products 
this increase was partially offset by decreased personnel related costs of million due to higher average headcount during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million or  as compared to sales and marketing expense of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel related costs of million due to increased average headcount  increased average salaries and increased stock based compensation expense for sales and marketing employees during as compared to and increased general marketing activities of million primarily associated with an increasing number and size of our marketing events domestically and abroad 
the results for the year ended december  included twelve months of expenses related to the acquired webct operations as compared to the year ended december   which only included ten months of expenses related to the acquired webct operations following the completion of the merger on february  further  bad debt expense of million was recorded during the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to bad debt expense of million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation expense of million for general and administrative function employees during the year ended december  recruiting expense also increased million during the year ended december  due to the hiring of employees across all functional areas to support our growth 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in personnel related costs due to approximately million in retention bonuses and severance costs primarily for webct employees recognized during the year ended december  offset  in part  by increased personnel related costs due to increased average headcount and increased average salaries for general and administrative employees during the year ended december  net interest expense 
our net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million or  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to interest income earned on higher average cash and cash equivalents balances during as compared to resulting from proceeds received in connection with the notes issued during interest income was partially offset by interest expense incurred in connection with the notes and the credit facilities agreement we entered into with credit suisse to fund a portion of the acquisition of webct during the credit agreement 
during the year ended december   we recorded total debt discount amortization expense  including amortization related to the notes and the credit agreement  of approximately million as interest expense 
other expense income 
our other income for the year ended december  was million and pertains to the remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries ledgers  which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency  into the united states dollar 
specifically  we recognized a translation gain related to the valuing of intercompany debt with our wholly owned canadian subsidiary as a result of the change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar into the us dollar during benefit provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million as compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  the increase in income taxes was due to our income before provision for income taxes during the year ended december  as compared to our loss before benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state  federal and international income tax purposes of approximately million 
approximately million of this amount is restricted under section of the internal revenue code 
section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes  as defined by that section  occur 
we have performed an analysis of our section ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards subject to section will be limited to approximately million per year 
net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if unused  between and due to the length of time available to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and the likelihood of having sufficient taxable income in those periods  we believe it is more likely than not that million of these assets will not be realized

the increase in blackboard learning system enterprise product revenue was also attributable to the continued shift from the blackboard learning system basic products to the blackboard learning system enterprise products and cross selling other enterprise products to existing clients

net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  quarterly results our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as incurred  in our second and third quarters each year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
the following table sets forth selected statements of operations and cash flow data for each of the quarters in the years ended december  and quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands total revenues total operating expenses loss income from operations net income loss net cash used in provided by operating activities during the three months ended december   we adjusted our estimated forfeiture rate from approximately to approximately which resulted in a reduction of previously recorded compensation expense of approximately million

cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments  which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  this change for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to net income of million for the year ended december   which was an increase of million from the net loss of million for the year ended december  amortization of intangibles increased to million during the year ended december   as the results for included twelve months of amortization expense related to amortization of acquired technology intangibles resulting from the webct merger as compared to the year ended december   which only included ten months of amortization expense following the completion of the merger on february  we recognize revenues on annually renewable agreements ratably over the term  which results in deferred revenues

the credit agreement provided for a million senior secured term loan facility repayable over six years and a million senior secured revolving credit facility due and payable in full at the end of five years 
we repaid million on the revolving credit facility on march  the credit agreement allowed for voluntary prepayments of principal with no penalty 
in june  we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a public offering 
we used a portion of the proceeds to terminate and satisfy in full our existing indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement of million and to pay all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the termination 
additionally  during  we repaid an additional million in indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement 
we were not required to pay any prepayment premium or penalties in connection with the early termination of the credit agreement 
in connection with obtaining the notes  we incurred million in debt issuance costs 
these costs were recorded as a debt discount and netted against the remaining principal amount outstanding 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes 
during the year ended december   we recorded total amortization expense  including amortization related to the credit agreement  of approximately million as interest expense 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount  accruing from june  interest is payable semi annually on january and july  commencing on january  the notes will mature on july   subject to earlier conversion  redemption or repurchase 
on december   we made an interest payment of million 
the notes will be convertible  under certain circumstances  into cash or a combination of cash and our common stock at an initial base conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
the base conversion rate represents an initial base conversion price of approximately 
if at the time of conversion the applicable price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price  the conversion rate will be increased by up to an additional shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes  as determined pursuant to a specified formula 
in general  upon conversion of a note  the holder of such note will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and our common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
in accordance with the earnings per share method outlined in eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  the diluted earnings per share effect of the shares that would be issued will be accounted for only if the average market price of our common stock price during the period is greater than the notes conversion price 
because the notes contain an adjusting conversion rate provision based on our common stock price and anti dilution adjustment provisions  at each reporting period  we will evaluate whether any adjustments to the conversion price that would alter the effective conversion rate from the stated conversion rate and result in an in the money conversion 
whenever an adjustment to the conversion rate results in a number of shares of common stock in excess of approximately million shares under the notes  we would recognize a beneficial conversion feature in that period and amortize it over the remaining life of the notes 
as of december   a beneficial conversion feature under the notes does not exist 
holders may surrender their notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for the notes only under the following circumstances prior to january   with respect to any calendar quarter beginning after june   if the closing price of the company s common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than of the base conversion price per share of the notes on such last trading day  on or after january   until the close of business on the business day preceding maturity  or during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing price of the company s common stock and the then applicable conversion rate of the notes  or other events or circumstances as specifically defined in the notes 
if a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the notes  occurs prior to july   we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the applicable conversion rate for any notes converted in connection with such fundamental change by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
the notes may not be redeemed by us prior to july   after which they may be redeemed at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes on july   july  or july   or in the event of certain fundamental change transactions  at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such debt  and are effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the nti group  inc for a purchase price of million in cash and million in our common stock  which equated to approximately million shares of our common stock  with up to an additional million shares of our common stock contingent on the achievement of certain performance milestones 
in connection with the transaction  we paid a portion of the purchase price using proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
this acquisition will give us the opportunity to offer clients the ability to send mass communications via voice  email and text messages 
we acquired the technology underlying blackboard connect  which we began offering in february  through the acquisition of the nti group  inc we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products or services  the timing of enhancements to existing products and services and the timing of capital expenditures 
also  we may make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  and  accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
obligations and commitments as of december   minimum future payments under existing notes payable and noncancelable operating leases are as follows for the years below notes operating payable leases in thousands and beyond total the notes may not be redeemed by us prior to july   after which they may be redeemed at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes on july   july  or july   or in the event of certain fundamental change transactions  at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
accordingly  we have categorized the notes above assuming the first redemption date by the holders of the notes on july  on december   we entered into an agreement with washington television center  llc pursuant to which we will lease approximately  square feet of office space in the building known as massachusetts avenue  washington  dc we will be relocating our corporate headquarters to the leased premises 
the lease term commences on the earlier of i five months and days from the date on which the landlord delivers the leased premises to us and ii the date on which we occupy the leased premises 
we anticipate that we will occupy the leased premises during the base annual rent will initially be per rentable square foot and will increase on each anniversary by  except on the fifth anniversary on which it will increase by per square foot 
the rent for the first four months of the first lease year and the first two months of the second lease year will be abated 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to the timing of client budget cycles and student attendance at client facilities 
historically  we have had lower new sales in our first and fourth quarters than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
historically  we have performed a disproportionate amount of our professional services  which are recognized as incurred  in our second and third quarters each year 
in addition  deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis for the same reasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our licenses and services offerings 
historically  we have generated more of our operating cash flow in the second half of the calendar year 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new market opportunities or new product introductions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income on our cash and cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
we deposit our cash with financial institutions that we consider to be of high credit quality and purchase investments which are generally investment grade  liquid  short term fixed income securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars 
for the year ended december   a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have reduced our interest income by approximately million 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
in particular  we have accounts recorded in canadian dollars 
therefore  when the canadian dollar strengthens or weakens against the united states dollar  net income is increased or decreased  respectively 
because of such fluctuations  other income of million was recorded during the year ended december  for the year ended december   a one percentage point adverse change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar into the united states dollar as of december  would have decreased other income by approximately million 
in addition to canada  we have subsidiaries and operations in australia  the netherlands  the united kingdom and various other countries  none of which have experienced hyperinflation in the recent past 
our product and service sales are substantially contracted for in the united states dollar and therefore we do not have significant exposure against the currencies of other countries in which we sell products and services
