item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the section entitled risk factors  cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
the historical data presented below is not indicative of future results 
our business our mission is to become a leading company in the professional services industry in the united states 
we intend to pursue this mission through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 
industry trends that affect our business include rate of technological change  rate of growth in corporate it and professional services budgets  penetration of it and professional services staffing in the general workforce  outsourcing of the it and professional services workforce  and consolidation of supplier bases 
we anticipate our growth will be primarily generated from greater penetration of our service offerings with our current clients  introducing new service offerings to our customers and obtaining new clients 
our strategy for achieving this growth includes cross selling our vendor management services  project solutions services and process solutions services to existing it staffing customers  aggressively marketing our services to new clients  expanding our range of value added services  enhancing brand recognition and making strategic acquisitions 
the success of our business depends primarily on the volume of assignments we secure  the bill rates for those assignments  the costs of the consultants that provide the services and the quality and efficiency of our recruiting  sales and marketing and administrative functions 
our brand name  our proven track record  our recruiting and candidate screening processes  our strong account management team and our efficient and consistent administrative processes are factors that we believe are key to the success of our business 
factors outside of our control  such as the demand for it and other professional services  general economic conditions and the supply of qualified professionals  will also affect our success 
our revenue is primarily driven by bill rates and billable hours 
most of our billings for our staffing and project solutions services are on a time and materials basis  which means we bill our customers based on pre agreed bill rates for the number of hours that each of our consultants works on an assignment 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
general economic conditions  macro it and profession service expenditure trends and competition may create pressure on our pricing 
increasingly  large customers  including those with preferred supplier arrangements  have been seeking pricing discounts in exchange for higher volumes of business or maintaining existing levels of business 
billable hours are affected by numerous factors  such as the quality and scope of our service offerings and competition at the national and local levels 
we also generate fee income by providing vendor management and permanent placement services 
our principal operating expenses are cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of services is comprised primarily of the costs of consultant labor  including employees  subcontractors and independent contractors  and related employee benefits 
approximately of our consultants are employees and the remainder are subcontractors and independent contractors 
we compensate most of our consultants only for the hours that we bill to our clients  which allows us to better match our labor costs with our revenue generation 
with respect to our consultant employees  we are responsible for employment related taxes  medical and health care costs and workers compensation 
labor costs are sensitive to shifts in the supply and demand of professionals  as well as increases in the costs of benefits and taxes 

table of contents the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are salaries  selling and recruiting commissions  advertising  lead generation and other marketing costs and branch office expenses 
our branch office network allows us to leverage certain selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising and back office functions 
our back office functions  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting  are consolidated in our customer service center in phoenix  arizona  which operates on a peoplesoft platform 
we also have a proprietary  web enabled front office system that facilitates the identification  qualification and placement of consultants in a timely manner 
we maintain a national recruiting center  a centralized call center for scheduling sales appointments and a centralized proposals and contract services department 
we believe this scalable infrastructure allows us to provide high quality service to our customers and will facilitate our internal growth strategy and allow us to continue to integrate acquisitions rapidly

in connection with the merger  we adopted venturi s fiscal year end 
accordingly  our fiscal year ends for  and were december   december   and january   respectively 
overview of results our stated priorities for were internal growth  efficiency improvements  improved working capital management and expansion of our operations through acquisitions 
we made the following progress against each during the year 
our revenues grew in from we ended the year with  billable consultants  which was essentially unchanged from the end of early in the year  we experienced large fall off at two major customers  which impacted our headcount throughout the year and caused our revenue growth in the second  third and fourth quarters to lag our peers 
average bill rates in increased slightly from average bill rates despite pricing pressures at several large clients 
we continued to see the benefits of our efficiency improvements throughout  and these improvements allowed us to redirect resources closer to the point of sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by in from  and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in due to our improved profitability and working capital management  our debt balance declined to million at the end of from million at the end of during  we generated million of cash flow from operations and used million for acquisitions 
we expect to make further debt reductions in our final priority was to expand our operations through selected acquisitions 
during  we completed four acquisitions 
our march acquisition of econometrix allowed us to bring a valuable vms software program in house 
the may acquisition of plum rhino expanded our offerings into the specialty finance and accounting sector  which has provided cross selling opportunities and expanded our offerings outside of it 
finally  in december  we purchased t 
williams consulting  llc  a recruitment process outsourcing business  and praeos technologies  inc  a business intelligence practice  to complement our existing solutions offerings 
these acquisitions will allow us to expand our managed solutions and process solutions offerings through our newly developed process solutions group  which will complement our traditional staffing and consulting businesses 
with behind us  we now have three full years of profitable operations since the merger 
overall  we were able to increase our gross profit by and our net income by from levels 
the decrease in our debt balance led to a reduction of in our net interest expense during outlook our priorities for will remain straightforward 
we plan to keep internal growth at the top of our priority list  and we will focus on sales  marketing and recruiting to our core customer base and on adding new customers 
additionally  we will continue to work on improving our balance sheet  where we feel we can generate additional cost savings through further debt reductions and working capital management 
continuing improvements in efficiency will also be a priority  and we are devoting considerable attention to process improvements  especially in sales and recruiting and in our front and back offices 
we will complement these priorities by looking for acquisitions at reasonable prices that have synergies with our existing operations 

table of contents we have benefited from low tax rates for financial reporting for some time now  but we do not expect that to last indefinitely if we continue to be profitable 
if we continue to be profitable  we will continue to evaluate each quarter our estimates of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether any portion of these fully reserved assets become more likely than not recoverable through future taxable income 
at such time  if any  that we no longer have a reserve for our deferred tax assets  we will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory rate 
our actual cash paid for taxes is expected to remain low in results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to revenues of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations  in thousands  except percentages and headcount amounts year ended percent change december  december  january  december  december  january  vs vs revenues from services cost of services gross profit operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative restructuring and integration costs  n a depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net loss on early extinguishment of debt other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income billable headcount at end of period year ended december   versus year ended december  we recorded operating income of million and net income of million in compared to operating income of million and net income of million in the increase in operating income was due primarily to stronger gross profit margins on slightly higher revenue and lower depreciation and amortization expense  while slightly reducing selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed above in overview of results 
revenues 
revenues for and were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of 
reimbursable expense revenue declined to million in from million in  primarily due to lower consultant related expenses at one major customer

interest expense was million and million in and  respectively  a decrease of that was due to a reduction in interest payments due to our overall debt reduction during and and a reduction in the related interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax is much lower than typical statutory rates given that income tax expense was in large part offset by a decrease in our valuation allowance 
the expense contains the following amounts current expenses in the amount of million for federal alternative minimum tax  million for the texas margin tax and other miscellaneous state income tax expenses and million for foreign income taxes related to our profitable united kingdom subsidiary  a deferred expense in the amount of million resulting from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on venturi s acquired net deferred assets from the merger and a deferred state tax benefit of million related to the conversion of our texas net operating loss carryforwards into the new texas margin tax credit 
although our net deferred tax asset is substantially offset with a valuation allowance  a portion of our fully reserved deferred tax assets that became realized through operating profits are recognized as adjustments to the purchase price as a reduction to goodwill to the extent they relate to benefits acquired in the merger 
this then results in deferred tax expense as the assets are utilized 
this portion of deferred tax expense represents the consumption of pre merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero basis 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of deferred tax asset realizable expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively 
the income tax benefit for is the result of a federal income tax refund of million  net of the impact of release of the valuation allowance on acquired net deferred tax assets from the merger and a provision for foreign income taxes related to our profitable foreign operations 
the federal income tax refund resulted from legislation that allowed us to carry back a portion of our net operating loss to prior years

in  we paid million in taxes  and  in  we received a tax refund  net of taxes paid  of million 
as of december   we had combined state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  an alternative minimum tax credit carryfoward of million  and had recorded a reserve against the assets for net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty related to the realization of these amounts

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in and were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of 
included in these amounts are million and million of stock based compensation  respectively 
the increase in total selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to i certain investments we made in new staff positions to expand our sales and delivery efforts and higher levels of accruals for performance incentives and commissions as our financial performance improved  ii a million charge for severance payments related to the departure of two executive officers  iii a charge of approximately million related to the transition of our internal it staff to our customer service center in phoenix  az  and iv a charge of approximately million related to the effect of a change in accounting for our commissions and certain employer related payroll taxes in connection with adopting securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of our fixed assets and amortization of our customer base intangible assets

the decline was the result of a lower asset amortization base as a result of an intangible asset that became fully amortized during the first half of interest expense 
interest expense was million and million in and  respectively  a decrease of that was due to a reduction in interest payments due to our overall debt reduction during and a reduction in our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends 
sfas requires that dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock be recorded as interest expense 
as a result  interest expense includes dividends and amortization of stock issuance costs in the amount of in and million in this stock was fully redeemed in december with proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
net interest expense on borrowings under our credit facilities  which includes amortization of related debt issuance costs  was million in compared to million in the increase was due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt and an increase in borrowings under higher rate term loans  partially offset by interest income of million related to a federal income tax refund received

as of december   we had combined state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and had recorded a reserve against the assets for net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty related to the realization of these amounts 
in  we received a million income tax refund related to the carryback of net operating losses and related interest that we did not previously anticipate and resulting from a change in legislation that allowed us to carry back a portion of our net operating loss to prior years 
as a result  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was reduced and a million income tax benefit was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining million was recorded as interest income in the statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have historically financed our operations through cash from operations  the issuance of common and preferred stock and borrowings under our credit facilities 
due to the requirements of our revolving line of credit  as discussed in more detail below under cash flows  we do not maintain a significant cash balance 
availability under our revolving line of credit at december   was million 
we believe our cash flow provided by operating activities coupled with existing cash balances and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our working capital  debt service and purchases of fixed assets and acquisition activity through fiscal the performance of our business is dependent on many factors and subject to risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors that may affect future operating performance under risk factors included elsewhere in this report

we made the first scheduled principal payment on the senior term loan in the first quarter of in may  we received a federal income tax refund  including interest  totaling million  which was used to pay down the principal balance of the senior term loan 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  this principal payment reduced the scheduled quarterly payments to million  and the first installment of this reduced amount was paid in the second quarter of on september   the senior credit agreement and second lien term loan credit agreement were amended 
among other things  the amendments provided for an increase in our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit to million from million and an increase in the senior term loan to million from million  which was the outstanding principal balance prior to the amendments

in connection with our purchases of praeos and twc in december  we further amended the senior credit agreement to add praeos and twc as additional credit parties under the agreement 
the senior term loan and borrowings under the revolver bear interest at the prime rate plus a margin that can range from to  or  at our option  libor plus a margin that can range from to  each depending on our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  as defined in our senior credit agreement  as amended 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee of per annum of the unused portion of the revolver 
we and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the loans and other obligations under the senior credit agreement 
the obligations under the senior credit agreement are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of us and our us subsidiaries  as well as the shares of capital stock of our direct and indirect us subsidiaries and certain of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries 
pursuant to the terms of the senior credit agreement  we maintain a zero balance in our primary domestic cash accounts 
any excess cash in those domestic accounts is swept on a daily basis and applied to repay borrowings under the revolver  and any cash needs are satisfied through borrowings under the revolver 
borrowings under the revolver are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the senior credit agreement and related amendments  reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and designated reserves

the principal balance of the senior term loan on that date was million with an interest rate of 
the senior term loan is scheduled to be repaid in eight equal quarterly principal installments  the fourth of which was made on december  
table of contents debt compliance our ability to continue operating is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our senior credit agreement  which contains customary covenants  including the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio and a total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  as defined in the senior credit agreement  as amended 
the senior credit agreement also places restrictions on our ability to enter into certain transactions without the approval of the lenders  such as the payment of dividends  disposition and acquisition of assets and the assumption of contingent obligations 
the senior credit agreement provides for mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and currently have no intention of paying them in the future

in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency  acceleration of our obligations under our senior credit agreement is automatic 
interest rate swap and cap we have historically been subject to market risk on all or a part of our borrowings under our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates 
effective february   we entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap which we terminated october  the swap agreement and cap agreement were contracts to effectively exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed rate payments over the life of the instruments as a means to limit exposure to increases in interest rates on the notional amount of bank borrowings over the term of the swap and cap 
the notional amount was used to measure interest to be paid or received and did not represent the exposure to credit loss 
the swap was based on a million notional amount at a rate of and the cap was based on a million notional amount at a rate of 
at january   the interest rate swap and cap were recorded at fair value  which represents the amount that merrill lynch capital would have paid us at january   if the swap and cap had been terminated at that date 
the combined net fair value at january   was million  which was included in our consolidated balance sheet in noncurrent assets 
effective with the repayment of our debt on december   the expected cash flows that the swap and cap were designated to hedge against were no longer probable 
as a result  the swap and the cap were no longer designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result  amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with changes in fair value of the hedges were reversed to interest expense 
changes in fair value of the swap and cap were recorded in the statement of operations subsequent to december  we recorded million as a reduction of interest expense in the fourth quarter of on october   we cancelled the swap and cap agreements and received a cash settlement of million  which was recorded as a reduction to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates include the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  the recoverability of goodwill  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves for medical costs  tax related contingencies and realization of deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our operations and include the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of comsys it partners  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin nos 
and  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  we recognize revenue and record sales  net of related discounts  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenues vary from period to period based on several factors that include the billable headcount during the period  the number of billing days during the period  and the average bill rate during the period 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recorded at the time services are performed 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
alternatively  the bill rates for some assignments are based on a mark up over compensation and other direct and indirect costs 
revenues from services are shown net of rebates and discounts relating primarily to volume related discount structures and prompt payment discounts under contracts with our clients 
we report revenues from vendor management services net of the related pass through labor costs 
vendor management services are services that allow our clients to automate and consolidated management of their temporary personnel contracting processes 
we also report revenues net for payrolling activity 
payrolling is defined as a situation in which we accept a client identified it consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee 
permanent placement fee revenues are usually determined based on a percentage of the employee s first year cash compensation and are recorded when candidates begin their employment 
reimbursable expenses are expenses we pay to our consultants that are reimbursed by our clients 
we record reimbursable expenses in revenue with the associated cost recorded in cost of services 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets we assess recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested annually for impairment  unless an event occurs or circumstances change during the year that reduce or may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value  in which event an impairment charge may be required during the year 
the annual test requires estimates and judgments by management to determine valuations for each reporting unit 
we have selected the first day of the last month of our fiscal year as the date on which we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
we performed our annual impairment test as of november   and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
different assumptions related to future cash flows  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates could result in an impairment charge  which would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income and a reduction in asset values on the balance sheet 
at december   and december   total goodwill was million and million  respectively 
our intangible assets other than goodwill represents acquired customer bases and are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer base  ranging from two to eight years 
at december   and december   net intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets 
we believe that all of our long lived assets are fully realizable as of december  
table of contents collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical level of write offs and judgments management makes about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
further  we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
additional allowances may be required if the economy or the financial condition of our customers deteriorates 
if we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of december   and december   the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of operations 
we have only awarded restricted stock since january we measure the fair value of restricted shares based upon the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock awards that vest in accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the straight line method 
the fair value of our stock option awards or modifications is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
due to the limited trading history of our common stock following the merger  expected stock price volatility for stock option grants prior to is based on an analysis of the actual realized historical volatility of our common stock as well as that of our peers 
the expected volatility assumption for stock option grants or modifications during was based on actual historical volatility of our common stock from the period after our december common stock offering through we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee forfeitures within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line attribution method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using the straight line attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different  and we would have to take an additional stock based compensation charge  which could be material 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december   that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
self insurance we offer employee benefits  including workers compensation and health insurance  to eligible employees  for which we are self insured for a portion of the cost 
we retain liability up to  for each workers compensation claim and up to  annually for each health insurance participant for which we are not insured 
these self insurance costs are accrued using estimates based on historical data to approximate the liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we believe that our estimation processes are adequate and our estimates in these areas have consistently been similar to actual results 
however  estimates in this area are highly subjective and future results could be materially different 

table of contents accrued bonuses we pay bonuses to certain executive management  field management and corporate employees based on  or after giving consideration to  a variety of financial performance measures 
executive management  field management  and certain corporate employees bonuses are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year  based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets 
variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore the estimates of the required accruals 
accordingly  the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals 
income tax assets and liabilities we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
although our net deferred tax asset is substantially offset with a valuation allowance  a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets that become realized through operating profits are recognized as adjustments to the purchase price as a reduction to goodwill to the extent they relate to benefits acquired in the merger 
this then results in deferred tax expense in the year the acquired deferred tax assets are utilized 
this portion of deferred tax expense represents the consumption of pre merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero basis 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of deferred tax asset realizable expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively 
we record an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these deferred tax items represent expenses or operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which will result in tax deductions over varying future periods 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income  timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be available to us 
we record an estimated tax liability or tax benefit for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent upon various matters  including resolution of tax audits  and may differ from amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded as a provision or benefit to income tax expense in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability or benefit differs from the recorded amount 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
if we continue to be profitable  we will continue to evaluate each quarter our estimates of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether any portion of these fully reserved asset become more likely than not recoverable though future taxable income 
at such time  if any  that we no longer have a reserve for our deferred tax assets  we will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory rate 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in addition  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  in accordance with the threshold and measurement attributes of fin  uncertainties in accounting for income taxes  if any  are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and we will adopt the new requirements in our fiscal first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and we will adopt the new requirements in our fiscal first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which provides new accounting requirements for business combinations 
sfas r defines business combinations as a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one of more businesses 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will adopt the new requirements in our fiscal first quarter of we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting sfas r on our future consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to interest rate  foreign currency and equity price fluctuations 
our use of derivative instruments has historically been insignificant and it is expected that our use of derivative instruments will continue to be minimal 
interest rate risks outstanding debt under our senior credit agreement at december   was approximately million 
interest on borrowings under the agreement is based on the prime rate or libor plus a variable margin 
based on the outstanding balance at december   a change of in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
foreign currency risks our primary exposures to foreign currency fluctuations are associated with transactions and related assets and liabilities related to our operations in canada and the united kingdom 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
these operations are not material to our overall business 
equity market risks the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future
