item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion and analysis of imperial s financial results  as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer  are the responsibility of the management of imperial oil limited 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting  refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon based products 
the company s business involves the production or purchase  manufacture and sale of physical products  and all commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods 
imperial  with its resource base  financial strength  disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio  is well positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new canadian energy supplies 
while commodity prices remain volatile on a short term basis depending upon supply and demand  imperial s investment decisions are based on its long term business outlook  using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities 
the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near term operating and capital objectives  in addition to providing the longer term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes 
potential investment opportunities are tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each opportunity 
once investments are made  a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into future projects 

table of contents business environment and risk assessment long term business outlook economic and population growth are expected to remain the primary drivers of energy demand  globally and in north america 
the company expects the global economy to grow at an average rate of about three percent per year through the combination of population and economic growth should lead to an increase in demand for primary energy at an average rate of percent annually 
the vast majority of this increase is expected to occur in developing countries 
oil  gas and coal are expected to remain the predominant energy sources with approximately an percent share of total energy 
oil and gas alone are expected to maintain close to a percent share 
over the same period  the canadian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of about two percent per year  and canadian demand for energy at less than one percent per year 
oil and gas are expected to continue to supply about two thirds of canadian energy demand 
it is expected that canada will also be a growing supplier of energy to us markets through this period 
oil products are the transportation fuel of choice for the world s fleet of cars  trucks  trains  ships and airplanes 
primarily because of increased demand in developing countries  oil consumption will increase by about percent or about million barrels a day by canada s resources of heavy oil and oil sands represent an important additional source of supply 
natural gas is expected to be a major primary energy source globally  capturing about percent of all incremental energy growth and approaching one quarter of global energy supplies 
natural gas production from mature established regions in the united states and canada is not expected to meet increasing demand  strengthening the market opportunities for new gas supply from canada s frontier areas 
natural resources imperial produces crude oil and natural gas for sale into large north american markets 
crude oil and natural gas prices are determined by global and north american markets and are subject to changing supply and demand conditions 
these can be influenced by a wide range of factors  including economic conditions  international political developments and weather 
in the past  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile  and the company expects that volatility to continue 
imperial has a large and diverse portfolio of oil and gas resources in canada  both developed and undeveloped  which helps reduce the risks of dependence on potentially limited supply sources in the upstream 
with the relative maturity of conventional production in the established producing areas of western canada  imperial s production is expected to come increasingly from frontier and unconventional sources  particularly heavy oil  oil sands and natural gas from canada s north  where imperial has large undeveloped resource opportunities 
petroleum products the downstream industry environment remains very competitive 
refining margins are the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials primarily crude oil and the wholesale market prices for the range of products produced primarily gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil  jet fuel and heavy fuel oil 
while refining margins have been strong over the last few years  real inflation adjusted refining margins have declined at a rate of about one percent per year over the past years 
intense competition in the retail fuels market similarly has driven down real margins 
crude oil and many products are widely traded with published international prices 
prices for those commodities are determined by the marketplace  often an international marketplace  and are affected by many factors  including global and regional supply demand balances  inventory levels  refinery operations  import export balances  transportation logistics  seasonality and weather 
canadian wholesale prices in particular are largely determined by wholesale prices in adjacent us regions 
these prices and factors are continually monitored and provide input to operating decisions about which raw materials to buy  facilities to operate and products to make 
however  there are no reliable indicators of future market factors that accurately predict changes in margins from period to period 
imperial s downstream strategies are to provide customers with quality service at the lowest total cost offer  have the lowest unit costs among our competitors  ensure efficient and effective use of capital and capitalize on integration with the company s other businesses 
imperial owns and operates four refineries in canada  with distillation capacity of  barrels a day and lubricant manufacturing capacity of  barrels a day 
imperial s fuels marketing business includes retail operations across canada serving customers through more than  esso branded service stations  of which about are company owned or leased  and wholesale and industrial operations through a network of primary distribution terminals  as well as a secondary distribution network 
chemicals the north american petrochemical industry is cyclical 
the company s strategy for its chemicals business is to reduce costs and maximize value by continuing to increase the integration of its chemicals plants at sarnia and 
table of contents dartmouth with the refineries 
the company also benefits from its integration within exxonmobil s north american chemicals businesses  enabling imperial to maintain a leadership position in its key market segments 
results of operations net income in of  million or a share on a diluted basis was the best on record  exceeding the previous record achieved in of  million or a share 
earnings increased primarily due to higher crude oil commodity prices  stronger industry refining and marketing margins  favourable refinery operations and higher syncrude volumes 
gains from asset divestments were also higher in these factors were partially offset by lower expected conventional resources volumes  the negative impact of a stronger canadian dollar  higher exploration and share based compensation expenses and higher tax expense 
natural resources net income from natural resources was  million versus  million in earnings benefited from higher crude oil commodity prices totaling about million and higher syncrude volumes of about million 
higher gains from asset divestments of about million also contributed to higher earnings 
offsetting these positive factors were lower natural gas  conventional crude oil  and natural gas liquids ngls volumes totaling about million  the negative impact of a stronger canadian dollar of about million and higher exploration and other operating expenses of about million 
financial statistics millions of dollars net income operating revenues world crude oil prices  denominated in us dollars  were higher in than in the previous year 
the annual average price of brent crude oil  the most actively traded north sea crude and a common benchmark of world oil markets  was about us a barrel in  about percent higher than the average price of in 
however  the company s canadian dollar realizations for conventional crude oil increased to a lesser extent because of a stronger canadian dollar 
average realizations for conventional crude oil during the year were cdn a barrel  an increase of less than five percent from in 
average realizations for cold lake heavy oil in us dollars were about five percent higher for the year 
also mainly because of a stronger canadian dollar  the company s average realizations for cold lake heavy oil were lower by about two percent in prices for canadian natural gas in were lower than in the previous year 
the average of day spot prices for natural gas in alberta was about a thousand cubic feet in  compared with in

gross production of heavy oil at the company s wholly owned facilities at cold lake was a record  barrels a day  surpassing the previous record of  barrels in 
increased production was due to the cyclic nature of production at cold lake and increased volumes from the ongoing development drilling program 
production from the syncrude oil sands operation  in which the company has a percent interest  was higher during with increased volumes from the stage upgrader expansion 
gross production of synthetic crude oil increased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
imperial s share of average gross production increased to  barrels a day from  barrels in gross production of conventional oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in  as a result of natural decline in western canadian reservoirs and the impact of divested properties 
gross production of ngls available for sale averaged  barrels a day in  down from  barrels in  mainly due to the declining ngl content of wizard lake gas production 

table of contents gross production of natural gas decreased to million cubic feet a day from million in million 
lower production volumes were primarily due to decline  as expected  in production from the gas cap at wizard lake 
in  the company realized a gain of million primarily from the sale of the company s interests in several producing properties 
production of the company s share of these properties averaged about  oil equivalent barrels a day in in  the gain on divestment of assets was approximately million million

b diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the cold lake heavy oil to facilitate transportation to market by pipeline 
c production of natural gas includes amounts used for internal consumption with the exception of the amounts reinjected 
operating costs increased by less than three percent in higher exploration and other operating costs were partially offset by lower depreciation expenses 
on may   the company confirmed and implemented a management services agreement with syncrude canada ltd  under which syncrude will be provided operational  technical and business management services from imperial and exxon mobil corporation 
petroleum products net income from petroleum products was a record million  million higher than increased earnings were primarily due to improved refinery operations including lower refinery maintenance and project activities which contributed about million  and stronger industry refining and marketing margins totaling about million 
these positive factors were partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger canadian dollar of about million and the absence of favourable tax effects of about million

c crude oil and feedstocks sent directly to atmospheric distillation units 
one thousand litres are approximately barrels 
margins were stronger in the refining segment of the industry in compared with those in  pushed up by increased demand for refined petroleum products that stemmed from generally stronger global economic conditions 
however  the effects of stronger industry margins were reduced partially by a higher canadian dollar 
marketing margins in were slightly higher than those in refinery throughput was percent of capacity in  unchanged from the previous year percent 
refinery throughput in and was lower than in due to planned and unplanned downtime of crude processing facilities 
the company s total sales volumes  excluding those resulting from reciprocal supply agreements with other companies  were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
lower refinery production was the main reason for the decline 
operating costs in were lower than the previous year by about two percent  reflecting lower maintenance and project related expenses 
chemicals net income from chemicals operations was million  compared with million in lower earnings were primarily due to lower industry margins for polyethylene products partially offset by the positive impact of lower tax rates 
a stronger canadian dollar also negatively impacted earnings in financial statistics millions of dollars net income operating revenues sales thousands of tonnes a day a polymers and basic chemicals intermediate and others total chemicals a calculated by dividing total volumes for the year by the number of days in the year 
the average industry price of polyethylene was  a tonne in  slightly lower than  a tonne in 
sales of chemicals were  tonnes a day  compared with  tonnes a day in  tonnes primarily due to higher volumes in intermediate chemical products 
operating costs in the chemicals segment for were about three percent lower than in  reflecting lower direct operating expenses 
corporate and other net income from corporate and other was negative million  versus negative million last year 
unfavourable earnings effects were primarily due to higher share based compensation charges and the impact of tax rate changes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash millions of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year although the company issues long term debt from time to time and maintains a revolving commercial paper program  internally generated funds cover the majority of its financial requirements 
the management of cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the company s immediate needs is carefully controlled  both to optimize returns on cash balances and to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the company s cash requirements 
cash flows from operating activities are highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and product margins 
in addition  to support cash flows in future periods the company will need to continually find and develop new fields  and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields  in order to maintain or increase production 
projects are in place or underway to increase production capacity 
however  these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks  including project execution  operational outages  reservoir performance and regulatory changes 
the company s financial strength enables it to make large  long term capital expenditures 
imperial s large and diverse portfolio of development opportunities and the complementary nature of its business segments help mitigate the overall risks of the company and associated cash flow 
further  due to its financial strength  debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities  the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for its operations and fixed commitments 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  million  versus  million in  million 
higher cash flow in was primarily due to higher net income 
unfavourable impact of the timing of income tax payments was largely offset by net effects of higher commodity prices on working capital balances 
cash flow from investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million in  compared with million in million 
lower planned spending on property  plant and equipment and higher proceeds from asset sales contributed to the change 
capital and exploration expenditures total capital and exploration expenditures were million in  compared with  million in  million 
the funds were used mainly to invest in cold lake to maintain and expand production capacity  advance upstream projects  invest in environmental initiatives  and upgrade the network of esso retail outlets 
about million was spent on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of the company s operations and improving safety 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for natural resources during the five years ending december  millions of dollars heavy oil and oil sands production exploration total capital and exploration expenditures for the natural resources segment  over percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in were focused on growth opportunities 
significant expenditures during the year were made to ongoing development drilling at cold lake 
other investments included advancing the kearl oil sands and mackenzie gas projects  drilling at conventional fields in western canada  and exploration off the east coast of canada 
expenditures at syncrude were lower in primarily due to the completion of the stage upgrader project  partially offset by increased investment in other facility improvement projects and programs 

table of contents the alberta energy and utilities board and the government of canada gave conditional regulatory approval in february to the company s proposed kearl oil sands project  following a joint federal and provincial review 
the company is advancing the project including further progress in engineering work to define the project design  execution strategies and project cost estimate 
in march  the company  on behalf of the mackenzie gas project co venturers  filed updated cost and schedule information on the proposed project with the national energy board and joint review panel 
the updated project costs are billion for the gas gathering system  billion for the mackenzie valley pipeline and billion for the development of the anchor fields 
current project activities are focused on regulatory work  finalizing remaining benefits and access agreements and establishing an appropriate fiscal framework with the federal government 
all the scheduled public hearings by the joint review panel and the national energy board were concluded in late the regulatory process continues with a joint review panel report expected in followed by a national energy board decision in early drilling of an exploration well with co venturers in the orphan basin off the east coast of newfoundland was concluded in april 
exploration costs related to the well were reflected in earnings 
results from the well will be used to plan future drilling in the area 
during the year  the company  along with co venturer exxonmobil canada  successfully acquired exploration rights for a parcel in the beaufort sea 
the company s percent share of the proposed exploration spending would be about million with a minimum commitment of about million 
planned capital and exploration expenditures in natural resources are expected to be about  million in  with over percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
investments are mainly planned for development drilling at cold lake and conventional oil and gas operations in western canada  facilities improvement at syncrude  the kearl oil sands project  the mackenzie gas project  and exploration off the east coast

table of contents unrecognized tax benefits totaling million have not been included in the company s commitments table because the company does not expect there will be any cash impact from the final settlements as sufficient funds have been deposited with the canada revenue agency 
further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in note to the financial statements on page f the company was contingently liable at december   for a maximum of million relating to guarantees for purchasing operating equipment and other assets from its rural marketing associates upon expiry of the associate agreement or the resignation of the associate 
the company expects that the fair value of the operating equipment and other assets so purchased would cover the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees 
litigation and other contingencies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f  a variety of claims have been made against imperial oil limited and its subsidiaries 
based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuits against the company will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
in  the alberta government proposed changes to the oil and gas and generic oil sands royalty regime beginning in the company believes that this proposal could have an adverse effect on future company investments in alberta and the company s future financial results 
the magnitude of the potential impact will depend on the final form of enacted legislation and the future prices of oil and gas and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the syncrude joint venture owners have a crown agreement with the province of alberta that codifies the royalty rates through december  the syncrude joint venture owners are in discussions with the alberta government to determine if an amended agreement can be negotiated that would transition syncrude to the new generic oil sands royalty regime before recently issued statements of financial accounting standards fair value measurements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value when an entity is required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas must be adopted by the company no later than january  for all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value and non financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at fair value at least annually 
sfas must be adopted no later than january  for non financial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value at least annually 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include estimates that reflect management s best judgment 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model 
imperial does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements on page f hydrocarbon reserves proved oil  gas and synthetic crude oil reserve quantities are used as the basis of calculating unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the company through long standing approval guidelines 
reserve changes are made within a well established  disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals assisted by a central reserves group with significant technical experience  culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors 
notably  the company does not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation 
key features of the estimation include rigorous peer reviewed technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance information and a requirement that management make significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves prior to reporting as proved 

table of contents although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors  including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
the year end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the proved reserves tables are calculated using december prices and costs 
these reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit of production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow 
the us securities and exchange commission regulations preclude the company from showing in the financial section of this document the reserves that are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the basis that the company uses to make its investment decisions 
the use of year end prices for reserves estimation introduces short term price volatility into the process  since annual adjustments are required based on prices occurring on a single day 
the company believes that this approach is inconsistent with the long term nature of the natural resources business where production from individual projects often spans multiple decades 
the use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by the company and annual variations in reserves based on such year end prices are not of consequence in how the business is actually managed 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or revaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production data  new geologic  reservoir or production data  or changes in year end prices and costs that are used in the determination of reserves 
this category can also include changes associated with the performance of improved recovery projects and significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment facility capacity 
the quantities shown in the revisions category under heavy oil proved reserves in and on page were due mainly to the changes in year end prices and costs that were used in the determination of reserves 
the company uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities 
under this method  costs are accumulated on a field by field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred 
costs of productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method for each field 
the company uses this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of the company s exploration and production activities 
impact of reserves on depreciation the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of natural resources assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset cost are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
while the revisions the company has made in the past are an indicator of variability  they have had little impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation 
impact of reserves and prices on testing for impairment proved oil and gas properties held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  impairment analyses are based on proved reserves 
where probable reserves exist  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant decrease in current and projected prices or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected and historical and current operating losses 
in general  the company does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests 
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility 
although prices will occasionally drop precipitously  the relative growth decline in supply versus demand will determine industry prices over the long term and these cannot be accurately predicted 
accordingly  any impairment tests that the company performs make use of the company s price assumptions developed in the annual planning and budgeting process for crude oil and natural gas markets  petroleum products and chemicals 
these are the same price assumptions that are used for capital investment decisions 
volumes are based on individual field production profiles  which are also updated annually 
the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows on page is based on the year end price applied for all future years  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
future 
table of contents prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the one used in the sfas disclosure and could be lower or higher for any given year 
pension benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate of future compensation increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior management 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to changes in assumptions is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f at imperial  differences between actual returns on plan assets and the long term expected returns are not recorded in pension expense in the year the differences occur 
such differences are deferred  along with other actuarial gains and losses  and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees 
pension expense represented less than one percent of total expenses in asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives are recognized when they are incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed 
the obligations are initially measured at fair value and discounted to present value 
over time  the discounted asset retirement obligation amount will be accreted for the change in its present value  with this effect included in operating expense 
as payments to settle the obligations occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets  which can exceed years  the discount rate will be adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
for  the obligations were discounted at six percent and the accretion expense was million  before tax  which was significantly less than one percent of total expenses in the year 
there would be no material impact on the company s reported financial results if a different discount rate had been used 
asset retirement obligations are not recognized for assets with an indeterminate useful life 
asset retirement obligations for these facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled 
these obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation 
however  these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations  and as such  the fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured  since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations 
for these and non operating assets  the company accrues provisions for environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities are based on engineering estimated costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  current technology and the possible use of the location 
since these estimates are specific to the locations involved  there are many individual assumptions underlying the company s total asset retirement obligations and provision for other environmental liabilities 
while these individual assumptions can be subject to change  none of them is individually significant to the company s reported financial results 
tax contingencies the operations of the company are complex  and related tax interpretations  regulations and legislation are continually changing 
significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict 
gaap requires recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns 
the benefit of an uncertain tax position can only be recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities 
for a position that is likely to be sustained  the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized 
a reserve is established for the difference between a position taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements 
the company s unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f

in april  the government of canada announced its intent to introduce a set of regulations to limit emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants from major industrial facilities in canada beginning in  although the details of the regulations have not been finalized

the company will continue to monitor the development of legal requirements in this area 
in the province of alberta  regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial facilities came into effect july  the company does not expect ongoing compliance costs to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the recently enacted us energy independence and security act of precludes agencies of the us federal government from procuring motive fuels from non conventional petroleum sources that have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions greater than equivalent conventional fuel 
this may have implications for the company s marketing in the united states of some heavy oil and oil sands production  but the impact cannot be determined at this time 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
the company does not use derivative markets to speculate on the future direction of currency or commodity prices and does not sell forward any part of production from any business segment 
the company s size  strong financial position and the complementary nature of its natural resources  petroleum products and chemicals segments help mitigate the company s exposure to changes in these other risks 
the company s potential exposure to these types of risk is summarized in the earnings sensitivity table below  which shows the estimated annual effect  under current conditions  of certain sensitivities of the company s after tax net income 
earnings sensitivities a millions of dollars after tax nine dollars us a barrel change in crude oil prices sixty cents a thousand cubic feet change in natural gas prices one cent u 
s a litre change in sales margins for total petroleum products one cent us a pound change in sales margins for polyethylene ten cents decrease increase in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar a the amount quoted to illustrate the impact of each sensitivity represents a change of about percent in the value of the commodity or rate in question at the end of each sensitivity calculation shows the impact on net income that results from a change in one factor  after tax and royalties and holding all other factors constant 
while these sensitivities are applicable under current conditions  they may not apply proportionately to larger fluctuations 
the sensitivity of net income to changes in crude oil prices decreased from year end by about million after tax for each one us dollar difference 
an increase in the value of the canadian dollar has lessened the impact of the us dollar denominated crude oil prices on the company s revenues and earnings 
the sensitivity of net income to changes in natural gas prices decreased from year end by about million after tax for each cent change  primarily due to the company s lower natural gas production 
the sensitivity of net income to changes in the canadian dollar versus the us dollar decreased from year end by about million after tax for each one cent difference 
this was primarily due to the impact of the widening price spread between light crude oil and cold lake heavy oil
