organization of information the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements 
our md a is presented in the following sections executive summary and financial highlights results of operations operating segment results liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and other commercial commitments off balance sheet financing application of critical accounting estimates recently adopted accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs  manufactures  distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines  electric power generation systems and engine related component products  including filtration and exhaust aftertreatment  fuel systems  controls and air handling systems 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including chrysler llc  daimler ag  volvo ab  paccar inc  international truck and engine corporation navistar international corporation  cnh global nv  komatsu  scania ab  ford motor company and volkswagen 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves 
this type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and rvs  as well as various industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines  generator sets and alternators and rents power equipment for both standby and prime power uses 
the components segment includes sales of filtration products  exhaust aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets  and service parts  as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels 
our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages 
economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products 
as a worldwide business  our operations are also affected by political  economic and regulatory matters  including environmental and emissions standards  in the countries we serve 
however  our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact of any one industry and the economy of any single country upon our consolidated results 
this was effectively demonstrated in as we continued to experience strong sales and earnings despite the continued softness in the north american heavy duty truck engine market which was down approximately percent from levels 
more than half of our sales came from countries other than the united states 
the diversity of our business portfolio has contributed to the significant organic growth we have experienced over the past several years continuing into financial highlights for the last three years were as follows years ended december  consolidated results in millions  except earnings per share net sales    gross margin    investee equity  royalty and other income operating earnings   net earnings diluted earnings per share we continued our strong performance of the past three years into with a fourth straight year of record net sales and net earnings 
net earnings were million  or per diluted share  on sales of billion  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  on sales of billion 
the earnings improvement was driven by a percent increase in net sales and a percent increase in gross margin  as we benefited from improved pricing and higher demand across most of our businesses  increased market share in a number of markets and focused cost reduction efforts 
all of our segments reported sales increases for the year compared to  with particularly strong demand in power generation s commercial and alternator businesses where sales increased percent and percent  respectively  and component s emission solutions and turbocharger businesses  where sales increased percent and percent  respectively 
overall  our engine segment net sales were up million  or percent year over year benefitting from market share gains in the heavy duty on highway market 
in addition  net sales increased at our power generation segment up million  or percent  components segment up million  or percent and distribution segment up million  or percent year over year 
during  we continued our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet  investing in profitable growth around the globe and returning value to our shareholders 
key activities included financing matters the board of directors authorized a pair of two for one splits of cummins common stock in the first split was authorized on march  and was distributed on april   to shareholders of record as of march  the second split was authorized on december  and was distributed on january   to shareholders of record as of december  all share and per share amounts in this filing have been adjusted to reflect both two for one stock splits 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our previously announced share repurchase program 
in july  the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares adjusted for the impact of a two for one stock split on april  and an additional two for one stock split on january  of cummins common stock in addition to what had been acquired under previous authorizations 
during  we purchased six million shares for approximately million 
in july  the board also voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by percent to per share adjusted for the two for one stock split on january  
during  we made contributions of approximately million to our pension plans 
as of the end of  our global pension funding was more than percent of our qualified pension obligation 
we repaid million of our million debentures on february   at the election of the debt holders 
the debentures were repaid using cash generated from operations 
our level of debt at december   has decreased by million since december  and our debt to capital ratio has improved to percent at december   from percent at december  business expansion in  we made global investments of million in our unconsolidated joint ventures including million in five new joint ventures and million in additional investments to our existing joint venture businesses 
after announcing a feasibility study in the spring of  we signed an agreement in october with beiqi foton motor company beiqi foton to form a joint venture  beijing foton cummins engine company bfcec  to produce two families of cummins light duty  high performance diesel engines in beijing 
the engines will be used in light duty commercial trucks  pickup trucks  multipurpose and sport utility vehicles 
certain types of marine  small construction equipment and industrial applications will also be served by this engine family 
cummins and beiqi foton will initially invest a combined million into bfcec  which is scheduled to begin production in in october of  we received approval of the joint venture from the chinese government and we invested million during the year 
in  we made capital expenditures of million which included expenditures of million for the introduction of new products and million to increase our manufacturing capacity around the world 
business divestiture in november  we sold certain assets of our universal silencer usi subsidiary  based in stoughton  wisconsin  to stirling group  llc 
the sale closed in the fourth quarter of for approximately million and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
usi  which was part of our components segment  specializes in designing and manufacturing noise control and air filtration products for industrial equipment 
total assets of usi were approximately million at the date of the transaction and million at december   which is less than percent of our total assets at those dates 
total sales of usi were approximately million and million  for the ten months ended october  and for the year ended december   respectively  which is less than percent of our total company consolidated net sales for both periods

net sales net sales increased due to record sales in all segments 
net sales changes by segment were as follows vs 
in millions change change engine power generation components distribution engine sales were higher due to improved pricing on our emission compliant engines  strong demand in almost all on highway and off highway markets and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
increased engine sales were due to market share gains in the heavy duty on highway engine market and were partially offset by decreased demand in our north american heavy duty on highway market as a result of the change in emissions standards 
engine and parts sales to industrial markets were percent higher with increased volumes in all market segments 
power generation sales increased due to improved pricing and strong organic growth led primarily by increases in commercial generator and alternator sales 
components sales increased primarily due to organic sales growth in our emission solutions  turbocharger and filtration businesses 
distribution sales increased primarily due to increased demand for power generation products followed by increased parts and engine sales which were partially offset by the deconsolidation of one of our north american joint ventures beginning in the net sales of this joint venture were approximately million in see our operating segment results section for further details on sales by segment 
gross margin gross margins improved primarily due to new pricing and increased volumes which were partially offset by increased costs for new products  increased warranty expenses and the deconsolidation of one of our north american joint ventures 
significant drivers impacting gross margins were as follows vs 
in millions change price volume incremental production costs product mix warranty expense deconsolidation of a joint venture other total gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by percentage points as margin percentages declined in three of our segments  primarily driven by the engine and components segments 
in the engine segment  price increases for new products were offset by higher new product costs  increased warranty costs and the decreased heavy duty engine volumes 
in the components segment  two of our businesses are experiencing low margins as a result of inefficient production costs associated with meeting extremely strong demand 
warranty expense as a percent of sales increased to percent from percent in the increase in warranty expense was expected as the mix of emissions compliant engines and components increased 
as has been our practice and as described in our critical accounting estimates  new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific claims experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear claims experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in infrastructure investments  including the number of employees to provide for our growing business  higher compensation and related expenses of approximately million  which included salaries  variable compensation and fringe benefits  as a result of our improved financial performance 
other factors affecting selling and administrative expenses also included increased consulting fees and other outside services of million 
the remaining change in selling and administrative expenses is due to a combination of increases in various other miscellaneous expenses  none of which were individually significant 
overall selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined to percent in from percent in research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to higher spending on new product development and critical technologies for and beyond  including product development for emissions standards and developing products for new growth areas 
the power generation and components segments accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively  which was partially offset by a million decrease in the engine segment 
fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate 
investee equity  royalty and other income investee equity  royalty and other income increased primarily due to an increase in earnings at several of our equity investees  led by a million increase in earnings from our north american distributors as the result of organic growth  acquisitions and the deconsolidation of a north american joint venture in in addition  dcec increased million  ccec increased million and cummins mercruiser diesel increased million  while the other joint ventures had slight increases 
other operating income  net the major components of other operating income are gain or loss on sale of fixed assets and businesses and royalty income 
the increase in income over was primarily due to a million increase in gain on sale of fixed assets 
in addition  royalty income increased by approximately million in and legal expenses decreased million compared to increases in miscellaneous operating expenses slightly offset the increase in income and were not material 
interest income interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in compared to the lower average cash balances were due to significant spending for capital expenditures  repurchases of common stock and pension contributions 
interest expense interest expense decreased primarily due to a decline of million in debt balances  partially offset by higher interest rates 
other income expense  net the major components of other income expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses on translation and transactions  bank charges and other miscellaneous income and expenses 
the increase in income in  compared to  is primarily due to a net increase in foreign currency exchange gains of approximately million in as compared to million in  a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred when we repaid our million notes in december and a million increase in dividend income in partially offsetting these increases were several fluctuations in the components of miscellaneous other income and expenses  none of which were individually significant 
provision for income taxes our tax rates have been less than the percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits 
export tax benefits also reduced our tax rate prior to our effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent for the increase is in part due to the full repeal after of us export tax benefits which reduced our tax rate by percent 
our income tax provision for also included a million percent benefit for the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years offset by a million percent increase for the effect of new indiana tax legislation 
we expect our effective tax rate to be percent excluding any discrete items that may arise 
the research tax credit expired december  and has not yet been renewed by congress 
if the research credit is extended  we would anticipate the effective tax rate to drop to percent 
minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries minority interests are primarily attributable to cil  a percent owned subsidiary and wuxi holset engineering co 
ltd 
wuxi  a percent owned subsidiary 
these two subsidiaries accounted for over percent of the total minority interest in earnings at these two subsidiaries increased this year resulting in a combined increase in minority interest earnings of million for compared to these increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of cummins eastern canada llp cec  a percent owned subsidiary  on january  the remainder of the consolidated partially owned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity 
at december   we believe our liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million  million available under our revolving credit facility  million  based on eligible receivables  available under our accounts receivable program and million available under international credit facilities together with our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital  debt service obligations  capital expenditures  projected pension obligations  common stock repurchases  dividend payments and expansion in emerging markets 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our receivable sales program 
working capital summary we fund our working capital with cash from operations and short term borrowings when necessary 
various assets and liabilities  including short term debt  can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs 
as a result  working capital is a prime focus of management attention 
in millions current assets   current liabilities   working capital   current ratio days sales in receivables inventory turnover current assets increased million  primarily due to a million increase in receivables driven by the increase in net sales and a million increase in inventories 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline in cash and cash equivalents see cash flows below 
current liabilities increased million  primarily due to an increase in accounts payables of million and increases in accrued warranty  compensation and other accrued liabilities of million  million and million  respectively  all due to business expansions 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in short term borrowings of million 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during the year ended december  the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash from operations net cash provided by operating activities declined million in  compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in the deferred income tax provision  partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for working capital and a decrease in pension contributions of million 
net changes in working capital utilized million in cash during  compared to utilizing million in cash utilized for working capital tends to fluctuate from period to period based on various factors including sales and production volumes as well as timing 
the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets  market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans 
better than expected investment returns and additional voluntary contributions have improved the funded status of all plans  helping to minimize future required funding 
we continued making additional pension contributions by contributing million to our pension plans during the year 
our qualified pension plans are currently over percent funded 
we anticipate making contributions of million to million to our pension plans in and paying approximately million in claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits 
the million of pension contributions included voluntary contributions of million 
these contributions and payments include payments from company funds to either increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants 
net cash provided by operating activities improved million in  compared to  primarily due to million of higher net earnings and a million decrease in cash utilized for working capital  partially offset by an increase in pension funding of million and a decrease in cash provided by changes in long term liabilities of million 
net changes in working capital utilized million in cash during compared to utilizing million in  or a net decrease in cash utilized for working capital of million year over year 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased million in  compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in capital expenditures  a million outflow for the purchase of long term investments  an increase of million in cash used for investments in and advances to equity investees and an increased outflow of million for the acquisition of businesses  the majority of which was to acquire the remaining percent equity ownership in a joint venture 
capital expenditures for increased percent to support our growth  and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products 
our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products are accelerating across all of our businesses and are designed for future growth opportunities 
we continue to invest at least half of our capital in low cost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction and future growth opportunities 
capital expenditures for all of were million to support these initiatives 
we expect capital expenditures to total approximately million to million in in addition  we expect to invest approximately million on new and existing joint ventures in net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of million  which includes an increase in investments in internal use software of million 
net cash utilized for purchases of marketable securities in was million as we increased our short term investment holdings as opposed to when we were in a net liquidation of securities position with net cash proceeds of million 
significant sources of cash from investing activities year over year included increased proceeds from the disposal of equipment of million as well as million of proceeds from the sale of seg 
the majority of our capital spending in was primarily for new product introduction  capacity expansion  manufacturing equipment  and tooling for new products 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased million in  compared to the majority of the increase in cash outflows is due to the increase in repurchases of common stock of million and a decrease in the proceeds from borrowings of million  which was partially offset by a million decrease in payments on borrowings and capital leases 
in the first quarter of  approximately million of our million debentures were repaid on february   at the election of the debt holders 
our total debt was million as of december   compared with million at december  total debt as a percent of our total capital  including total long term debt  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  included in long term debt at december  and  was million and million  respectively  attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of fin r see notes and to the consolidated financial statements

the consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our or net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants 
we do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods 
as of december   short term and long term debt also included amounts from the fin r consolidation of cec which was deconsolidated in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the deconsolidation 
in july  the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares adjusted for the impact of a two for one stock split on april  and an additional two for one stock split on january  of cummins common stock 
in  we repurchased approximately million of common stock  at an average cost of per share adjusted for the impact of both two for one stock splits  representing approximately six million shares 
this concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in july as of december   two million shares adjusted for the impact of both two for one stock splits announced in had been purchased under the plan 
in december  the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to million worth of cummins common stock which we plan to begin purchasing in the share repurchase program is expected to be a significant use of our cash flows in and future years  however  total repurchases may vary quarter to quarter depending on other investing and financing activities  market conditions  or restrictions 
in july  the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by percent and increased cash dividends to per common share adjusted for the two for one stock split on january  in the third and fourth quarter of dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the years ended december  were as follows quarterly dividends adjusted for the two for one stock splits in and first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon earnings and liquidity position  among other factors 
net cash used in financing activities increased million in  compared to in  we repaid our million notes while in we repaid our million notes 
the other significant use of cash in financing activities when comparing to relates to repurchases of our common stock 
in  we completed our previously announced million stock repurchase and we began repurchasing stock under a new repurchase plan that began in the third quarter of year over year our stock repurchases increased million 
also contributing to the increase  to a lesser extent  was a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and an increase in dividend payments due to the percent increase in quarterly dividends that the board approved in july during the third quarter of  we extended a lease related to a portion of our rental business by six years 
the lease was set to expire on september  instead of paying a balloon payment of approximately million on september   the amount was financed over a six year term at a fixed rate 
in addition to extending this lease  we reduced the interest rate by approximately percentage points 
during the fourth quarter of  we refinanced a lease related to another portion of our rental business 
under the terms of the agreement which was effective as of january   the new lease has a six year term and the interest rate is approximately percentage points lower than the existing lease 
the total amount refinanced was approximately million 
both leases were treated as capital leases both before and after the changes 
for more information regarding our rental business and related lease agreements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  we amended and extended the lease on our corporate headquarters facility to the total rental payments to be made over the revised lease term are approximately million 
as a result of this extension  we were required to re evaluate the classification of this lease 
based on the terms of the extension  this lease is now classified as a capital lease 
as a result  our long term debt increased by approximately million 
on may   the board of directors approved our plan to redeem all of the convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in june on may   we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities 
this notification provided the holders of the preferred securities days in which to convert their securities into shares of common stock 
upon expiration of the notification period  all remaining securities not converted were redeemed for cash at a premium above liquidation value 
substantially all of the million convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock during the second quarter of as a result of the conversion  approximately million shares adjusted for the impact of a two for one stock split on april  and an additional two for one stock split on january  of common stock were issued during the second quarter which resulted in an increase of approximately million to common stock outstanding and an increase of approximately million to additional paid in capital 
since substantially all holders converted their preferred securities to common stock  the loss on extinguishment of this debt was insignificant 
in september  we announced our intention to repay the million notes in december  the first call date for the debt 
the notes were issued in november and were repaid in december using cash generated from operations 
we paid a premium of approximately million due to the early retirement of this debt 
financial covenants and credit rating a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements  such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale leaseback agreements have restrictive covenants and or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating

in july  we amended the agreement to extend the facility until july  and raised the purchase limitation from million to million 
the agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to million upon approval 
as necessary  ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables  without recourse  to the financial institution 
to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold  we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected 
receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in receivables  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr 
there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating  however  the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility 
as of december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under this program 
financing arrangements for related parties in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements  we may purchase and or sell products and components from to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties 
the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices 
certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost  some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 
we purchase significant quantities of mid range diesel and natural gas engines  components and service parts from cdc  a general partnership that was formed in with j 
i 
case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity 
cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares percent ownership in cdc 
under the terms of the agreement  cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners 
each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of cdc s actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner s purchase requirement 
the partners are each obligated  unconditionally and severally  to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc  provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced 
the transfer price of cdc s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period  including interest and financing expenses  but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement 
in addition  each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity  which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee 
to date  neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 
we are not a guarantor of any of cdc s obligations or commitments 
however  we are required as a partner to provide up to percent of cdc s base working capital as defined by the agreement 
the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required  the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc  or we may elect to fund the requirement  although we are under no obligation to do so 
to date  when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount  we have elected to provide that funding to cdc 
if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount  it is funded equally by the partners 
excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdc s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount 
any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 
under the provisions of fin r  cdc and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us are considered vies and we are deemed the primary beneficiary of these vies by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them 
as a result  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of cdc and the other engine manufacturer into our consolidated financial statements

application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
there were no accounting policies adopted during that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  accounting for income taxes  pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs  primarily base warranty and other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the time of failure 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
accounting for income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets include million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
we adopted sfas  except for the measurement date change  as required on december  we will adopt the measurement date change effective january  the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a year average market value of return 
the long term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities  fixed income  real estate and other miscellaneous investments 
the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period and our expected rate for long term expected return assumptions us plans non us plans a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and us pension plans  respectively 
under sfas  the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period and our expected expense for pension expense in millions the decrease in periodic pension expense in and is due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in and in addition  our expense is expected to decline as the amortization of prior investment losses begins to be replaced with the amortization of prior investment gains 
another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 
discount rates us plans non us plans changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in eitf d which suggests a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by standard poors for the us and iboxx for the us all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and us were high quality  non callable bonds aa or better as of november  the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to sfas and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
our model called for years of benefit payments 
for the us plans  the sum of the cash flows from the bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process 
the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio 
the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 
in developing the uk discount rate  excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years  thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed 
as a result  the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining 
we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 
due to the flat shape of the yield curve  this methodology choice impacted the discount rate by less than two basis percentage points 
the discount rate would have been slightly higher had the cash flows been allowed to reinvest 
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
impact on pension expense increase decrease millions discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets percent increase percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
our three year average rate of return has exceeded percent in each of the last three years 
as a result  based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year for us pension assets is reasonable 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and and target allocation for are as follows percentage of plan assets at december  investment description target allocation equity securities fixed income real estate other total actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of the act 
the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes 
among its many provisions  the act establishes a percent funding target for plan years beginning after december  our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate 
the table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period and our expected range of contributions for contributions in millions contributions beyond will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act 
our qualified pension plans in the us and outside the us were over funded at december   by a total of million due to our funding strategy and pension trust asset performance 
we have under funded plans of million at december   which are primarily non qualified plans in the us under sfas  the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs credits are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
reductions in these amounts increased our shareholders equity by million after tax and minority interest in the reductions resulted from strong plan asset performance and significant pension contributions in and the past several years 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses  working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period 
additionally  management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and  if less than the carrying value  a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
as of the end of the third quarter in  we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million 
changes in our projections or estimates  a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share based payment transactions 
share based payment transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
we implemented the revised standard in the first quarter of prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee awards issued after december   using the fair value method preferred by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur 
sfas r also requires prospective presentation of the excess tax benefits on stock based awards as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas  which requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements 
in addition  sfas requires companies to measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of a fiscal year rather than a date within days of the end of the fiscal year 
we adopted sfas effective december   except for the change in measurement date provisions  which are not effective until total assets  total liabilities  minority interests and total shareholders equity were impacted in the following manner 
total assets increased by approximately million  total liabilities increased by approximately million  minority interests decreased by approximately million and shareholders equity decreased by approximately million 
the adoption of sfas did not impact compliance with any of our financial covenants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements  uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the adoption of fin  effective january   did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the adoption of this standard 
accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we will adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequently unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we do not expect to elect the fair value methodology under sfas for any of our financial instruments  thus the adoption of sfas will not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas r makes significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions 
because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after january   sfas r will not impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
for cummins  the most significant impact of the standard  at adoption  will be to reclass our minority interests million at december  to be included as a part of equity  which may affect certain performance and equity ratios 
we are currently evaluating the potential additional impact that sfas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity forward contracts  currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions  we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions 
the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 
to achieve this objective  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million  due in debt from a fixed rate of to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
commodity prices we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities  we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity forward contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the forward contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note to the consolidated financial statements
