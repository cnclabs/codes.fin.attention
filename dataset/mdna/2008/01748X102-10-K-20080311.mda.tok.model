overview who we are 
we are a leisure travel company 
the focus of our business is a low cost passenger airline marketed to leisure travelers in small cities 
our business model emphasizes low operating costs  diversified revenue sources  and the transport of passengers from small cities to leisure destinations 
our route network  pricing philosophy  product offering and advertising are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services from us 
we provide service primarily to las vegas nevada  phoenix arizona  ft 
lauderdale florida  orlando florida  and tampa st 
petersburg florida  five of the most popular leisure destinations in the united states 
we have positioned our business to take advantage of current lifestyle and demographic trends in the us we believe are positive drivers for the leisure travel industry 
the most notable demographic shift occurring in the us is the aging of the baby boomer generation as they enter their peak earning years and have more time and disposable income to spend on leisure travel 
we believe a large percentage of our customers fall within the baby boomer demographic and we target these customers through the use of advertisements in more than print circulations 
our fleet 
the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us at the dates indicated december  december  december  own a lease total own a lease total own a lease total md s mds total a aircraft owned includes aircraft subject to capital leases as follows december   december   december  our markets 
our scheduled service consists of limited frequency nonstop flights into leisure destinations from small cities 
as of december   we offered scheduled service from small cities primarily into las vegas  phoenix  ft 
lauderdale  orlando  and tampa st 
petersburg  including seasonal service 
the following shows the number of destinations and small cities served as of the dates indicated as of december  destinations small cities our fiscal year 
we operate on a calendar year ending on the last day in december 
for convenience  we refer to the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  as  and  respectively 
our operating revenue our operating revenue comprises both air travel on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotels  rental cars and other travel related services 
we believe our diversified revenue streams distinguish us from other us airlines and other travel companies 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue consists of nonstop flights between our leisure destinations and small cities 
fixed fee contract revenue 
our fixed fee contract revenue consists largely of fixed flying agreements with affiliates of harrah s entertainment inc that provide for a predictable revenue stream 
we also provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis to harrah s and others 
ancillary revenue 
our ancillary revenue is generated from the sale of hotel rooms  rental cars  advance seat assignments  in flight products and other items sold in conjunction with our scheduled air service 
we recognize our ancillary revenues net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees 
other revenue 
other revenue is generated from leased out aircraft and flight equipment 
seasonality 
our business is seasonal in nature with traffic demand historically being lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter 
our operating revenue is largely driven by perceived product value  advertising and promotional activities and can be adversely impacted during periods with reduced discretionary leisure travel spending  such as the back to school season 
our operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expense line items follows 
our cost structure is highly variable as we consider our fixed costs to have represented only of our operating expense per available seat mile casm in  or of our operating expenses 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of aircraft fuel  fuel taxes  into plane fees and airport fuel flowage  storage or through put fees 
under all of our fixed fee flying agreements  we are reimbursed by our customers if fuel exceeds a pre determined cost per gallon  and these reimbursements are netted against fuel expense 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense includes wages and salaries as well as expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes 
station operations expense 
station operations expense includes the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities and fees charged by third party vendors for ground handling services and commissary expenses 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense includes all parts  materials and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
also included are fees for repairs performed by third party vendors 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense includes all advertising  promotional expenses  travel agent commissions  and credit card discount fees associated with sale of scheduled service 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense consists of the cost of leasing aircraft which are operated under operating leases with third parties 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft that we own  and amortization on aircraft that we operate under capital leases 
other expense 
other expense includes the cost of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance  and all other insurance policies except for employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes employee bonuses  travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel  facility lease expenses  professional fees  personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
trends and uncertainties affecting our business we believe our financial success is driven by variable factors that affect airlines and their markets  and by trends affecting the travel industry 
the following discussion describes certain key factors we believe may affect our future performance 
demographics and consumer behavior the airline industry is influenced by lifestyle and demographic trends  and the performance of the broader us economy 
we believe the current demographic and lifestyle trends are positive drivers of the leisure travel industry 
the aging of the baby boomers as they enter their peak earning years with more disposable income has had a positive impact on growing consumer demand for leisure travel 
aircraft fuel the airline industry is heavily dependent on the use of jet fuel and fuel costs represent a significant portion of the total operating expenses for airlines 
fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations 
fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil  gasoline and other petroleum products 
the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
in the fourth quarter of  our average cost per gallon was compared to for the third quarter of partly in response to these recent higher fuel costs  we eliminated service on eight long haul routes and reduced frequency on other long haul routes as of december  labor the airline industry is heavily unionized and the wages and benefits of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements 
conflicts between unionized airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages 
we currently have a non unionized work force and are not subject to collective bargaining agreements at the present time 
our pilots and flight attendants have formed in house associations to negotiate matters of concern with us 
further attempts are possible to unionize our flight attendants as the waiting period required by the national mediation board nmb has elapsed since the prior rejection of union representation on december  if our employees were to unionize in the future and we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement  or we were to experience wide spread employee dissatisfaction  we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
in addition  we may be subject to disruption by organized labor groups protesting our non union status 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on our future results 
competition the airline industry is highly competitive 
passenger demand and fare levels have historically been influenced by  among other things  industry capacity and pricing actions taken by other airlines 
the principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing  customer service  routes served  flight schedules  types of aircraft  safety record and reputation  code sharing relationships  and frequent flyer programs 
results of operations the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the last three fiscal years 
operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses compared to summary we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million for by comparison  in  we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million 
as of december   we had a fleet of aircraft with in service compared with a fleet of aircraft with in service as of december  the growth of our fleet enabled a increase in available seat miles asms for compared to as departures increased by and average stage length decreased by scheduled service asms in represented of total asms compared to in as scheduled service asms increased by while fixed fee contract flying asms increased by 
operating revenue our operating revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in this was driven by a increase in total system revenue passenger miles rpms and a increase in revenue per asm rasm 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in due to a increase in scheduled service rpms 
yield increased year over year in due to a shorter scheduled stage length offset by the dilutive effect of introductory pricing on new routes to las vegas  eight new routes to orlando and four new routes to tampa st 
petersburg that started during introductory pricing for routes to our two new leisure destinations of phoenix and ft 
lauderdale in the fourth quarter also impacted yield in the decrease in average stage length coupled with an increase in load factor of percentage points resulted in a increase in scheduled service rasm from to 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue increased  or million  to million in up from million in fixed fee revenues increased principally because of increased flying for harrah s entertainment inc during ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in the increase in ancillary revenue was due to a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per passenger from to due primarily to the introduction of several new products 
other revenue 
lease revenue was generated during of million related to the purchase of eight engines while on lease to another airline 
the engines were returned to us in october with no subsequent lease revenue recognized 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased by  or million  to million in compared to for in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  defined as casm  for the indicated periods 
in addition  the table presents casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel  divided by available seat miles 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors which are beyond our control 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  to million in up from million in this change was due to a increase in gallons consumed due primarily to a increase in asms and an increase in the average cost per gallon to per gallon during compared to per gallon in salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased  or million  to million in up from million in this increase is largely attributable to a increase in full time equivalent employees to support our growth 
we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees as of december   compared to full time equivalent employees as of december  station operations expense 
station operations expense increased  or million  to million in compared to million in on a casm basis  station operations has remained flat since the expense increase during was in line with our asm growth 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased by  or million  to million in up from million in the increase in maintenance and repairs expense is largely attributed to the cost from heavy maintenance checks during compared to as both years we had checks performed  along with increase in routine line maintenance from the growth of our fleet 
maintenance and repairs casm declined as certain maintenance expenses were spread over a larger base of asms 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million  to million in compared to million in the increase is a result of the advertising and credit card discount fees associated with the increase in scheduled service revenue 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased by  or million  to million in from million in on a casm basis  aircraft lease rentals expense decreased to in down from in due to an increase in the percentage of owned versus leased aircraft 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in the increase of was primarily attributable to the number of in service aircraft owned or subject to capital leases which increased from as of december  to as of december   as well as the purchase of rotable parts to support the operating fleet 
other expense 
other expense increased by to million in compared to million in due mainly to increased employee bonuses  aviation insurance  facilities and training expenses associated with our company s growth  along with additional administrative requirements resulting from being a public company 
other income expense other income expense changed from a net other expense amount of million in to a net other income amount of million in this change is primarily attributable to two factors a loss on fuel derivatives of million in compared to a gain on fuel derivatives of million in and an increase in interest income from million in to million in as a result of increased cash balances 
we recognized a million loss in on the mark to market adjustment for our open fuel derivative contracts and we recognized million in net losses for contracts settled in by contrast  we recognized a million gain in on the mark to market adjustment for our open derivative contracts and we recognized million in net gains for contracts settled in income tax expense income tax expense for was million as our effective income tax rate for the period was 
prior to our reorganization into a corporation at the time of our initial public offering on december   we did not pay corporate federal income tax at the entity level and therefore  we did not incur any federal income tax prior to the initial public offering date 
the income tax expense for was impacted by a million charge to recognize deferred tax liabilities due to the tax reorganization carried out in connection with our initial public offering 
compared to summary we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million for by comparison  in  we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million 
as of december   we had a fleet of aircraft with in service compared with a fleet of aircraft with in service as of december  the growth of our fleet enabled a increase in available seat miles for compared to as departures increased by and average stage length decreased by 
substantially all of our asm growth in compared to was in scheduled service which represented of total asms in compared to in fixed fee contract flying asms increased by  and scheduled service asms increased by 
operating revenue our operating revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in this was driven by a increase in rpms and a increase in rasm 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenues increased  or million  to million in from million in due to a increase in scheduled service rpms 
yield increased in versus due to a shorter scheduled stage length and the dilutive effect of introductory pricing on new routes to las vegas  nine new routes to orlando and new routes to tampa st 
petersburg started during the decrease in average stage length coupled with an increase in load factor of percentage points resulted in a increase in scheduled service rasm from to 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenues increased  or million  to million in up from million in revenues increased because of a short term contract running from may through august ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenues increased to million in up from million in the increase in ancillary revenue was due to a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per passenger from to due primarily to the sale of several new products 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased by  or million  to million in up from million during the same period in the following table represents our unit costs  casm  for the indicated periods year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  to million in up from million in this change was due to a increase in gallons consumed and a increase in the average cost per gallon to per gallon during compared to in salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased  or million  to million in up from million in this increase is largely attributable to a increase in full time equivalent employees to support our growth 
we employed approximately full time equivalent employees as of december   compared to full time equivalent employees as of december  station operations expense 
station operations expense increased  or million  to million in compared to million in the increase in station operations expense exceeded the increase in departures contributing to an increase of in station operation expenses on a casm basis 
the increase in unit station operations expense was driven by a large number of new station openings  particularly in the fourth quarter of  which outweighed an increase in the proportion of scheduled flying  which generally has a lower station operations expense per departure relative to fixed fee flying 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased by  or million  to million in up from million in maintenance and repairs casm increased as increased maintenance expense outpaced the increase in aircraft utilization 
the increase in maintenance and repairs expense is largely attributed to heavy maintenance checks on aircraft during versus four heavy checks during and the substantially larger fleet as of december  when compared to additionally  in we had a significant increase in the number of heavy engine overhauls over due to a significant year over year increase in the number of unplanned maintenance as a result of engine foreign object damage 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million  to million in compared to million in on a casm basis  sales and marketing expense declined primarily due to the elimination of travel agency commissions for air only sales  a decrease in credit card processing fees and an increase in the percentage of sales through our website  our lowest cost distribution channel 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense increased by  or million  to million in up from million in on a casm basis  aircraft lease rentals expense decreased to in down from in due to an increase in the percentage of owned versus leased aircraft and the benefits of higher aircraft utilization 
in  average block hours for aircraft in service increased  or hours  to hours per month compared to hours in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of as the number of in service aircraft owned or subject to capital leases increased from nine as of december  to as of december  other expense 
other expense increased by to million in compared to million in due mainly to increased aviation insurance  administrative  facilities and training expenses associated with our company s growth 
other income expense other expense increased from million in to million in this change was attributable to three factors net gain on fuel derivatives of million in compared to a loss of million in  an increase in interest expense from million in to million in relating to interest on aircraft purchased and acquired under capital leases during the period and an increase in interest income from million in to million in as a result of increased cash and short term investment balances 
our fuel derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
therefore  we recognize changes in the fair value of our derivatives when they occur  as a component of other income expense 
we recognize gain or loss from a mark to market adjustment at the end of each period  which estimates as of that date the future value of open contracts which will settle in subsequent periods 
gain or loss is also recognized as contracts settle and the amount can vary depending on the market value of fuel at that time 
we recognized a million loss in on the mark to market adjustment for our open fuel derivative contracts and we recognized million in net gains for contracts settled in by contrast  we recognized a million loss in on the mark to market adjustment for our open fuel derivative contracts and we recognized million in net losses for contracts settled in the change from an overall gain on fuel derivatives to a loss from to is due to the fact that fuel prices predominantly increased during and decreased during the second half of  along with an increase in the amounts hedged during income tax expense for all of and all but the last days of we operated as a limited liability company or subchapter s corporation 
under these structures  we did not pay federal corporate income tax for these periods 
instead  the members of the limited liability company or stockholders of the subchapter s corporation were liable for income tax on the taxable income as it affected their individual income tax returns 
accordingly  our income tax provision in reflects state taxes owed by us in certain states in which we operate 
for the last days of  we operated as a subchapter c corporation  and we expect to operate as a subchapter c corporation for the foreseeable future 
the income tax expense for was impacted by a million charge to recognize deferred tax liabilities due to the tax reorganization carried out in connection with our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are cash provided by operations and cash provided by financing activities 
our primary uses of cash are for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
historically  we have been able to fund our short term needs for capital from cash generated from operations 
our long term needs for capital are generally for the purchase of additional aircraft 
to the extent financing is not available on acceptable terms  we would apply our cash assets to the purchase of aircraft 
if we do not have sufficient cash assets available for this purpose at that time  then we would consider leasing aircraft or deferring their acquisition 
current liquidity our total cash  including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
restricted cash represents credit card deposits  escrowed funds under our fixed fee flying contracts  and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel properties for guaranteed room availability  airports and certain other parties 
short term investments represent marketable securities which are available for sale 
during and  our restricted cash balances increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of increased letters of credit issued to our hotel vendors 
under our fixed fee flying contracts  we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us 
the prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed 
prepayments are recorded as restricted cash and a corresponding amount is recorded as air traffic liability 
operating activities 
cash flows provided by operations for were million compared to million in this increase in cash flows provided by operations is primarily the result of increases in operating income and in passenger bookings for future travel 
during  cash flows provided by operations decreased from million provided in this decrease was due to changes in air traffic liability related to future travel and increased cash collateral requirements used to secure additional room capacity with our hotel partners offset by increases in net income  noncash depreciation and amortization  and deferred income taxes related to the conversion from a limited liability company to a c corporation 
investing activities 
cash used by investing activities totaled million for  compared to million in purchases of available for sale securities and capital expenditures for aircraft and equipment related to expanding our aircraft fleet constituted the primary uses of cash for investing activities 
during  we used cash of million for the purchase of property and equipment and million for the purchase of available for sale securities  net of maturities 
the property and equipment purchases in included an equipment package made up of eight engines and one airframe  two aircraft previously under operating lease  two aircraft purchased free and clear  and two other aircraft purchased with partial financing 
during  we expended million in cash for purchase of property and equipment and were provided million in cash from the maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for  compared to million in financing activities in primarily consisted of the proceeds from our secondary offering of our stock of million  offset by debt repayments related to aircraft financing and capital lease obligations 
during  we generated cash from the issuance of common stock in connection with our initial public offering of million  net of offering expenses  which was offset by debt repayments of million 
debt of the aircraft we have accepted delivery of as of december   we had secured debt financing on aircraft and capital lease financing on seven aircraft 
we financed the purchase of aircraft with notes for an aggregate initial borrowed amount of million  which are scheduled to mature between and the equipment notes bear interest at fixed rates between and with principal and interest payable monthly 
each note is secured by a first mortgage on the aircraft to which it relates 
we have a commitment to purchase two additional md aircraft with seller financing for delivery prior to the end of the second quarter of commitments and contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due in thousands total less than year years to years more than years long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     aircraft purchase obligations   total future payments on contractual obligations   long term debt obligations include scheduled interest payments 
operating lease obligations include aircraft operating leases and leases of airport station property and office space 
aircraft purchase obligations include four aircraft 
two of these aircraft are currently under operating leases with forward purchase agreements to take delivery and purchase at the end of the lease term in july also included are two other aircraft for which we have a commitment to purchase with seller financing for delivery prior to the end of the second quarter the amount of aircraft purchase obligations in the table include the entire purchase price of the aircraft 
off balance sheet arrangements we have significant obligations for aircraft that are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected on our balance sheet 
as of december   four of the aircraft in our fleet of which were in revenue service were subject to operating leases 
the operating lease terms for two of these aircraft expire in and remaining two expire in we have entered into a forward purchase agreement on the two operating leases that expire in  which expect to be effective in july and are subject to customary closing conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
revenue recognition 
scheduled service revenues consist of passenger revenue which is recognized when the travel related service or transportation is provided or when the ticket expires unused 
nonrefundable tickets expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer in advance of the intended flight 
tickets sold  but not yet used  as well as unexpired credits  are included in air traffic liability 
fixed fee contract revenues consists largely of long term agreements to provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis 
fixed fee contract revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided 
under certain of our fixed fee contracts  if fuel exceeds a predetermined cost per gallon  reimbursements are received from the customer and netted against fuel expense 
ancillary revenues are generated from the sale of hotel rooms and rental cars  advance seat assignments  in flight products and other items 
revenues from the sale of hotel rooms and rental cars are recognized at the time the room is occupied or rental car utilized 
the amount of revenues attributed to each element of a bundled sale involving hotel rooms and rental cars in addition to airfare is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the sale of hotel rooms  rental cars and other ancillary products are recorded net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees and are reported in accordance with eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenues from change fees imposed on passengers for making changes to nonrefundable tickets are recognized as they occur 
revenues from our travel protection product for unlimited changes to nonrefundable tickets are recognized at the time of purchase 
other revenue is generated from leased out aircraft and flight equipment 
lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
aircraft maintenance and repair costs 
maintenance and repair costs for flight equipment are accounted for using the direct expense method 
under this method  maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft  including major overhaul maintenance costs  are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
maintenance deposits paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities are recorded as prepaid maintenance deposits  and then recognized as maintenance expense when the underlying maintenance is performed 
these deposits are calculated based on a performance measure  such as flight hours or cycles  and are available for reimbursement to us upon the completion of the maintenance of the leased aircraft 
if there are sufficient funds on deposit to reimburse us for the invoices initially paid by us for these maintenance events  they are reimbursed to us 
if at any point we determine it is not probable we will recover amounts retained by the lessor through future maintenance events  such amounts are expensed 
the maintenance deposits paid under our lease agreements do not transfer either the obligation to maintain the aircraft or the cost risk associated with the maintenance activities to the aircraft lessor 
in addition  we maintain the right to select any third party maintenance provider 
therefore  we record these amounts as deposits on our balance sheet and then recognize maintenance expense when the underlying maintenance is performed  in accordance with our maintenance accounting policy 
maintenance deposits totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
any amounts that are not probable of being used to fund future maintenance expense would be recognized as additional aircraft lease rentals 
in determining whether it is probable that maintenance deposits will be used to fund the cost of maintenance events  we conduct the following analysis at the time of delivery of each aircraft under lease  we evaluate the aircraft s condition  including the airframe  the engines  the auxiliary power unit and the landing gear 
future usage of the aircraft is projected during the term of the lease based on our business and fleet plan 
we estimate the cost of performing all required maintenance during the lease term 
these estimates are based on the extensive experience of our management and industry available data  including historical fleet operating statistic reports published by the engine manufacturer  pratt whitney 
we review this asset the maintenance deposits for potential impairment in the preparation of our financial statements 
because there have been no material changes to the estimated cost of expected maintenance events during the remaining term of the leases  no impairment charge was recognized for the years ended december   or fuel derivatives 
we account for fuel derivatives pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
since we have not historically qualified for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts are required to be included in other income expense 
short term investments 
we maintain a liquid portfolio of investments that are available for current operations and to satisfy on going obligations 
we have classified our short term investments as available for sale and accordingly  unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
share based compensation 
we have issued common stock  restricted stock and stock options to executives and employees pursuant to our long term incentive plan and warrants to the placement agent involved in our may issuance of redeemable convertible preferred shares 
prior to january   we accounted for our share based compensation pursuant to the provisions of apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  fin no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  for equity based instruments issued to non employees  we apply the guidance in eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment as of january   which requires the recording of stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the prior pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
determining the fair value requires judgment  and we use the black scholes valuation model for equity instruments issued 
the most significant judgments required in connection with the use of the black scholes valuation model are the assumptions of volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
we determine these assumptions from a peer group of publicly traded airline companies due to our lack of historical information regarding our own stock price volatility and option exercise behavior 
before our stock was publicly traded  we measured fair value based on a variety of metrics including the share price of a peer group for both publicly traded airline companies and airline stock prices in general  consultation with third parties such as our investment advisors and outside consultants and individual attributes of our company including our then existing financial condition as well as future operating prospects 
in december  we issued  restricted shares under our long term incentive plan which were allocated as of the date of our initial public offering among our employees at the manager level or below 
as required by sfas no 
r  the fair value of the shares at the date of issuance was based on our initial offering price  and is being expensed ratably over the three year vesting period 
the total compensation expense from this restricted share grant will be per share for a total expense of million to be recognized over a three year period 
we have used our closing share price on the grant date as the fair value for all subsequent issuances of restricted stock 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position does not meet a standard of more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
the adoption of fin has not had a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for us as of january  on december   the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position no 
fas b  effective date of sfas proposed fsp 
the proposed fsp would amend sfas  to delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the proposed fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the proposed fsp 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have not determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of sfas for those items within the scope of the proposed fsp 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity prices specifically  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel expense for the years ended december  and represented approximately and of our operating expenses  respectively 
increases in fuel prices or a shortage of supply could have a material effect on our operations and operating results 
based on our fuel consumption  a hypothetical ten percent increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel would have increased fuel expense by approximately million for the year ended december  while we are not currently pursuing fuel hedging programs  in the past we entered into forward contracts or other financial products to reduce our exposure to fuel price volatility 
as of december  we had one fuel derivative contract outstanding with a fair value of less than million 
this contract settled in january interest rates we have market risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of our invested cash  which totaled million  and short term investments of million at december  we invest available cash in certificates of deposit  investment grade commercial paper  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned closely parallel short term floating interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates for the years ended december  and  would have affected interest income from cash and investments by million and million  respectively 
our long term debt consists of fixed rate notes payable and capital lease arrangements 
a hypothetical basis point change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
also  a hypothetical basis point change in market rates would not impact our earnings or cash flow associated with our fixed rate debt
