offsetting these decreases were increases of million related to sales of new designs and increased initial shipments 
gross profit gross profit increased slightly in amount  but decreased as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in gross profit dollars is due to the increased sales volume and decreased standard cost of sales offset by increased negative burden deferral  amortization and warehousing costs 
gross profit was negatively impacted in the current year by a  charge related to vinyl bibs recorded in the second quarter and acquisition related amortization expense of  in the current year compared to  in the previous year 
also  warehousing costs increased by  in the current year due to warehousing and shared services arrangements entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of the baby products line from springs global 
marketing and administrative expenses marketing and administrative expenses increased in both amount and as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year to fiscal year the company recorded  of share based compensation in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year also  the company incurred costs of  during fiscal year associated with the company s proxy contest 
additionally  the company experienced increased salaries and amortization as the company integrated the acquisition of the baby products line from springs global 
interest expense interest expense decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates primarily as a result of the refinancing of the company s debt on july  however  interest expense increased in the latter part of fiscal year due to a higher revolving line of credit and a new term loan executed in conjunction with the acquisition of the baby products line from springs global on november  gain on debt refinancing on july  the company refinanced its credit facilities 
in connection with the refinancing  non interest bearing subordinated indebtedness was reduced from million to million 
the million debt was carried on the company s books net of an unamortized discount of million immediately before the refinancing 
the new million debt was initially recorded net of an original issue discount of million 
the company recorded an approximate pre tax gain of million on the subordinated debt reduction in the second quarter of fiscal year financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended april  the change in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and inventory balances  offset by changes in accounts payable and accrued liability balances 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in the prior year 
cash provided in the current year was primarily borrowings on the revolving line of credit offset by payments on long term debt and treasury stock purchases 
cash used in the prior year was primarily due to the company s debt refinancing 
total debt outstanding increased to million at march   from million at april  the increase is primarily due to debt incurred to purchase the baby products line from springs global and borrowings on the revolving line of credit drawn down due to uncertainties in the united states credit markets 
as of march   letters of credit of million were outstanding against the million sub limit 
table of contents for letters of credit associated with the company s million revolving credit facility 
based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances as of march   the company had revolving credit availability of million 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay the interest on or to refinance its maturing indebtedness  to fund capital expenditures or to comply with its debt covenants will depend upon future performance 
the company s future performance is  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with revolving credit availability and cash on hand  will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs 
at march  and april   long term debt consisted of the following in thousands march  april  revolving line of credit term loan non interest bearing notes original issue discount capital leases less current maturities the company s credit facilities at march  include the following revolving line of credit of up to million  including a million sub limit for letters of credit  with an interest rate of prime minus at march  for base rate borrowings or libor plus at march   maturing on july  and secured by a first lien on all assets of the company 
there was a balance of million on the revolving line of credit at march   and the company had million available under the revolving line of credit based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances as of march  as of march   letters of credit of million were outstanding against the million sub limit for letters of credit 
the financing agreement for the million revolving line of credit contains usual and customary covenants for transactions of this type  including limitations on other indebtedness  liens  transfers of assets  investments and acquisitions  merger or consolidation transactions  dividends  transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of march  term loan of an original amount of million  with an interest rate of prime plus at march  and requiring equal monthly installments of principal until final maturity on november  subordinated notes of million 
the notes do not bear interest and are due in two equal installments of million each  the first of which is payable on july   and the second of which is payable on july  the original issue discount of million on this non interest bearing obligation at a market interest rate of is being amortized over the life of the notes 
the remaining unamortized balance of million is included in the consolidated balance sheet as of march  
table of contents minimum annual maturities are as follows in thousands fiscal revolver term loan sub notes other total total to reduce its exposure to credit losses and to enhance its cash flow  the company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to a commercial factor 
the company s factor approves customer accounts and credit lines and collects the company s accounts receivable balances 
under the terms of the factoring agreement  which expires in july  the factor remits payments to the company on the average due date of each group of invoices assigned 
if a customer fails to pay the factor on the due date  the company is charged interest at prime less  which was at march   until payment is received 
the factor bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved customers that are within approved credit limits 
the company bears losses resulting from returns  allowances  claims and discounts 
the company s factor may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer 
if such a termination occurs  the company must either assume the credit risks for shipments after the date of such termination or cease shipments to such customer 
management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations 
if inflation increases  the company will attempt to increase its prices to offset its increased expenses 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to adequately increase its prices in response to inflation 
critical accounting policies while the listing below is not inclusive of all of the company s accounting policies  the company s management believes that the following policies are those which are most critical and embody the most significant management judgments due to the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these critical policies are revenue recognition sales are recorded when goods are shipped to customers and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical rates 
allowances for returns  advertising allowances  warehouse allowances and volume rebates are netted against sales 
these allowances are recorded commensurate with sales activity and the cost of such allowances is netted against sales in reporting the results of operations 
shipping and handling costs  net of amounts reimbursed by customers  are relatively insignificant and are included in net sales 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates are made with respect to the allowances related to accounts receivable for customer deductions for returns  allowances and disputes 
the company has a certain amount of discontinued finished goods which necessitate the establishment of inventory reserves which are highly subjective 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowances against accounts receivable the company s allowances against accounts receivable are primarily contractually agreed upon deductions for items such as advertising and warehouse allowances and volume rebates 
these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity 
funding of the majority of the company s allowances occurs on a per invoice basis 
the allowances for customer deductions  which are netted against accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  consist of agreed upon advertising support  markdowns and warehouse and other allowances 
consistent with the guidance provided in eitf  all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales and 
table of contents such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activities 
when a customer requests deductions  the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments 
the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels 
the timing of the customer initiated funding requests for advertising support can cause the net balance in the allowance account to fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of such funding requests should have no impact on the consolidated statements of income since such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activity 
the company factors the majority of its receivables 
in the event a factored receivable becomes uncollectible due to credit worthiness  the factor bears the risk of loss 
the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectiblity of its non factored accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable at march  totaled million  net of allowances of million 
royalty payments the company has entered into agreements that provide for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales with certain minimum guaranteed amounts 
these royalty amounts are accrued based upon historical sales rates adjusted for current sales trends by customers 
total royalty expenses  net of royalty income  included in cost of sales amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and april   respectively 
inventory valuation the preparation of the company s financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company s inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company s consolidated balance sheets and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income and  therefore  has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in an accounting period 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which is the sum of expenditures and charges  both direct and indirect  incurred to bring inventory to its existing condition and location 
the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are manufactured or purchased 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company s finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
differences may result in the valuation of the company s inventories and in the amount and timing of the company s cost of goods sold and resulting net income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be used or sold within the normal operating cycles of the company s operations 
to the extent that any of these conditions is believed to exist or the market value of the inventory expected to be realized in the ordinary course of business is no longer as great as its carrying value  an allowance against the inventory valuation is established 
to the extent that this allowance is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in cost of goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may need to establish additional allowances which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
as of march   the company s inventories totaled million  net of allowances for discontinued  irregular  slow moving and obsolete inventories of million 
management believes that the company s inventory valuation results in carrying the inventory at lower of cost or market 
provisions for income taxes the provisions for income taxes include all currently payable federal  state and local taxes that are based upon the company s taxable income and the change during the fiscal year in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the company provides for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill the company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
in the event of impairment  the asset is written down to its fair market value 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are recorded at the lower of net book value or fair market value  less cost to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal  and are classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill annually and sooner if facts and circumstances suggest that the asset may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill and write downs  if any  are measured based on estimates of future cash flows 
goodwill is stated net of accumulated amortization of million at march  and april  on april   the company implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

as a result  the company discontinued amortizing goodwill but continued to amortize other long lived intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an annual impairment review of its goodwill 
with the exception of goodwill related to churchill  the company has determined that the fair value of its goodwill exceeded the recorded value at april  and april  churchill s goodwill of  was written off in june due to an impairment indicator  specifically the decline in sales volume and profitability in recent years 
churchill has since ceased operations  and its remaining assets are held for sale see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
on april   the company adopted the provisions of fin based on our recent evaluation  we have concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements 
our evaluation was performed for the years ended april   april  and april   the years which remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of march  the company s policy is to accrue interest expense and penalties as appropriate on its estimated unrecognized tax benefits as a charge to interest expense in the company s consolidated financial statements
