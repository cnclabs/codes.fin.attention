item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a clinical research organization that engages in the design and management of complex clinical trials for the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
our mission is to provide our clients with high quality  full service support for their clinical trials 
we offer therapeutic expertise  experienced team management and advanced technologies 
our headquarters is in wayne  pennsylvania and our international operations are based in espoo  finland 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
net revenue is derived principally from the design  management and monitoring of clinical research studies 
clinical research service contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years 
a portion of the contract fee is generally payable upon execution of the contract  with the balance payable in installments over the life of the contract 
several of our older contracts contain payment schedules that are weighted towards the later stages of the contract 
the majority of our net revenue is recognized from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure the performance  we compare actual direct costs incurred to estimated total contract direct costs  which we believe is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations as the costs relate to the labor hours incurred to perform the service 
contracts generally may be terminated by clients immediately or with short notice 
clinical trials may be terminated or delayed for several reasons including  among others  unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to the drug  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the drug  budget constraints of clients or decisions by the client to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial  development efforts on a particular drug or our failure to properly perform our obligations 
depending on the size of the trial in question  a client s decision to terminate or delay a trial in which we participate could have a material and adverse effect on our backlog  future revenue and results from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its judgments and estimates 
management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under 
table of contents different assumptions or conditions 
management considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition the majority of our net revenue is recognized from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance method based on assumptions regarding the estimated completion of the project 
this method is used because management considers total costs incurred to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
work is also performed under time and material contracts whereby we recognize revenue as hours are worked based on the hourly billing rate for each contract 
each month costs are accumulated on each project and compared to total estimated cost to complete to determine the degree of completion for that particular project 
this determines the percentage of completion for the project 
this percentage of completion is multiplied by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
as the work progresses  original estimates may be adjusted due to revisions in the scope of work or other factors and a contract modification may be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
our accounting policy for recognizing revenue for changes in scope is to recognize revenue when the company has reached agreement with the client  the services pursuant to the change in scope have been performed  the price has been set forth in the change of scope document and collectibility is reasonably assured based on our course of dealings with the client 
we bear the risk of cost overruns on work performed absent a signed contract modification 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is reasonably possible that the cost estimates used will change in the near term and may have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects resulting in lower gross margins on those projects 
these unanticipated additional costs occurred on several long term contracts which we completed or substantially completed during these contracts spanned a period of three to six years 
we may experience similar situations in the future although our current contracts in process are of a shorter duration and subject to less cost volatility 
should our estimated costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low in comparison to actual costs  future margins could be reduced  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
there are no standard billing and payment provisions which are present in each contract 
each contract has separate and distinct billing and payment terms which are the result of negotiation between us an the client 
billings and the related payment terms from fixed price contracts are generally determined by provisions in the contract that may include certain payment schedules and the submission of required billing detail 
the payment schedule in the contract reflects the value of services to be performed by us at the initiation of the contract 
the payment schedule may include the value of certain interim billing mechanisms as well as periodic payments which are reasonably assured at the start of the contract and which we expect to receive during the duration of the contract 
accordingly  cash receipts  including the receipt of up front payments  periodic payments and payments related to the achievement of certain billing mechanisms  do not necessarily correspond to cost incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
a contract s payment structure typically requires an upfront payment of to of the contract value at or shortly after the initiation of the contract  a series of periodic payments over the life of the contract and payments based upon the achievement of certain billing mechanisms 
the upfront payments are deferred and recognized as revenues as services are performed under the proportional performance method 
periodic payments  including payments related to the achievement of certain billing mechanisms in the contract  are invoiced pursuant to the terms of the contract once the agreed upon services criteria have been achieved 
payments based upon interim billing mechanisms are included in the value of the contract because we expect to receive them during the term of the contract 
all payments received pursuant to the contract are recognized in accordance with the proportional performance method 
in a comprehensive full service drug development program  the client would not generally purchase certain services separately but as an integrated  full service arrangement in connection with the development of the drug 
clients generally may terminate a contract on short notice which might cause unplanned periods of excess capacity and reduced revenues and earnings 
client initiated delays or cancellations for ongoing clinical trials can come suddenly and may not be foreseeable 
to offset the effects of early termination of significant contracts  we attempt to negotiate the payment of an early termination fee as part of the original contract 
generally  we have not been successful in negotiating such fees 
our contracts typically require payment to us of expenses incurred to wind down a study and fees earned to date 
therefore  revenue recognized prior to cancellation does not require a significant adjustment upon cancellation 
if we determine that a loss will result from the performance of a fixed price contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged against income in the period in which such determination is made 
our accounting policy for recognizing revenue for terminated projects requires us to perform a reconciliation of study activities versus the activities set forth in the contract 
we negotiate with the client  pursuant to the terms of the existing contract  regarding the wind up of existing study activities in order to clarify which services the client wants us to perform 
once we and the client agree on the reconciliation of study activities and the agreed upon services have been performed by us  we would record the additional revenue provided collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents our operations have experienced  and may continue to experience  period to period fluctuations in net service revenue and results from operations 
because we generate a large proportion of our revenues from services performed at hourly rates  our revenues in any period are directly related to the number of employees and the number of hours worked by those employees during that period 
our results of operations in any one quarter can fluctuate depending upon  among other things  the number of weeks in the quarter  the number and related contract value of ongoing client engagements  the commencement  postponement and termination of engagements in the quarter  the mix of revenue  the extent of cost overruns  employee hiring  employee utilization  vacation patterns  exchange rate fluctuations and other factors 
reimbursable out of pocket expenses on behalf of our clients  we pay fees to investigators and other out of pocket costs for which we are reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profit 
in connection with the required implementation on january   of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force rule no 
eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  out of pocket costs are included in operating expenses  while the reimbursements received are reported separately as reimbursement revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
as is customary in the industry  we will continue to exclude from revenue and expense in the consolidated statements of income fees paid to investigators and the associated reimbursement since we act as an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsors with regard to investigator payments  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force rule no 
eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
these investigator fees are not reflected in our net revenue  reimbursement revenue  reimbursement out of pocket expenses  and or direct expenses 
the amounts of these investigator fees were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
concentration of credit risk our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts are concentrated with a small number of companies within the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
the significant majority of this exposure is to large  well established firms 
credit losses have historically been minimal 
as of december   the total of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts was million 
of this amount  the exposure to our three largest clients was of the total  with the three largest clients representing  and of total exposure  respectively

table of contents income taxes the company eastimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established against excess net operating losses based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient operating income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
goodwill and intangible assets the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable to business combinations 
in accordance with these standards  goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium was not amortized 
however  the identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium will be amortized over their useful lives 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
if carrying value exceeds current fair value  then goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings 
the identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium are also subject to impairment testing under sfas no 
 whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
management has made an assessment of remedium s fair value as november   one year from the acquisition date  in order to determine whether the amount of goodwill and related intangible assets acquired had been impaired 
management has determined that both goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of remedium were not impaired and that no adjustment to the carrying values was necessary 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million and intangibles  net of amortization  of approximately resulting from the acquisition of remedium on november  results of operations the following table sets forth amounts for certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the following table excludes revenue and costs related to reimbursable out of pocket expenses because they are not generated by the services we provide  do not yield any gross profit to us  and do not have any impact on our net income 
we believe this information is useful to our investors because it presents the net revenue and expenses that are directly attributable to the services we provide to our clients and provides a more accurate picture of our operating results and margins

this was the first full year of operations for the combined company 
net revenue generated by remedium in europe was million or compared to million or of net revenue generated in the united states 
net revenues for generated in the us decreased by thousand to million from million for the decrease in net revenues in the us was primarily due to a decrease in the number of contracts and related contract values of active clinical studies being conducted by the company in the united states during our consolidated backlog at the end of decreased million to million compared to our backlog of million at the end of in  net revenue was adversely affected by cost increases approximating million or in the cost to complete for two legacy projects that were winding down as they entered the final stage of their development schedules 
these legacy projects experienced significant increases in their costs to complete without a corresponding increase in revenue in resulting in lower gross margins and reduced profitability on these projects 
the changes in cost estimates and related revenue adjustments for these legacy projects had a material impact on our net income for in there was no material impact on net revenue related to these legacy projects which were completed during in and  changes in cost estimates regarding our existing contracts did not materially impact our net revenues

reimbursement revenue consisted of reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our clients 
reimbursements are made at cost  without mark up or profit  and therefore have no impact on net income 
direct expenses included compensation and other expenses directly related to conducting clinical studies 
these costs increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in direct expenses resulted principally from the expenses incurred by remedium s operations in europe which totaled million for the year ended december  direct expenses in the united states totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million in  a thousand increase

sg a in the united states increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a in the united states was principally due to increases in business development and marketing activities as the company added additional personnel in this function and activities related to compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act

net interest income for the year ended december  remained relatively unchanged at thousand compared to net interest income of thousand for the year ended december  the tax benefit recognized relates primarily to the reversal of a deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of remedium oy 
the deferred tax liability represents the difference between the assigned value of the intangible assets acquired and the tax basis of these assets 
the company had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available at the end of the company recorded a full valuation allowance against the remaining available net operating loss carryforward in the united states 
in addition  the company has approximately million of state loss carryforwards for which the company recorded a full valuation allowance 
the company also has certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards available which also have been fully reserved

direct expenses included compensation and other expenses directly related to conducting clinical studies 
these costs increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in direct expenses resulted principally from an increase in the level of clinical trial studies conducted by the company during the increase in direct cost is principally due to headcount additions to meet the resource requirements of clinical studies being conducted by the company 
direct expenses as a percentage of net revenue were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of net revenue was principally due to higher staff utilization on studies being conducted by the company

depreciation and amortization expense increased to thousand for the year ended december  from thousand for the year ended december   primarily as a result of amortization of intangibles related to the remedium acquisition that was offset by a reduction in fixed asset additions during compared with loss from operations decreased by thousand to thousand  primarily for the reasons noted in the preceding paragraphs 
net interest income for the year ended december  was thousand compared to net interest income of thousand for the year ended december  this increase resulted from us having more cash on hand combined with a higher rate of interest earned on invested cash deposits 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  and was not material 
the company had  of federal net operating loss carryforwards available at the end of the company estimated that its taxable income in the united states was approximately  against which it applied the available net operating loss carryforwards

liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  acquisition related costs  capital expenditures  and facilities related expenses 
our principal source of cash is from contracts with clients 
if we are unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients and or if the level of contract cancellations increases  revenues and cash flow will be adversely affected 
absent a material adverse change in the level of the company s new business bookings or contract cancellations  we believe that our existing capital resources  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for the next twelve months 
however  if we significantly expand our business through acquisitions and or continue to incur a loss from operations we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of debt or equity securities in order to keep operating our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  if at all 
our contracts usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally made upon completion of specific billing mechanisms  or on a regularly scheduled basis  throughout the life of the contract 
several of our contracts contain payment schedules that are weighted towards the later stages of the contract 
accordingly  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized 
for terminated studies  our contracts entitle us to receive the costs and expenses of winding down the terminated project as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination 
net revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
as a result  the number of days net revenue outstanding in accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings  customer advances  and billings in excess of related costs will fluctuate due to the timing and size of billings and cash receipts 
at december   the net days revenue outstanding was days compared to days at december  compared to december   accounts receivable on a consolidated basis decreased million to million at december  of the accounts receivable balance at december   approximately of the total was over days past the due date 
compared to december   costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts decreased by thousand to million at december  the decrease is the result of achieving certain billing mechanisms contained in the contracts with our clients that the company attained and invoiced during the balance at december  primarily consisted of four clinical trials  which individually constituted   and of the 
table of contents balance 
these amounts are expected to be billed during as billing targets are met 
the liability account billings in excess of related costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased by thousand to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease resulted from recognition of revenue on contracts which we had billed and received advance payments from customers during the million decrease in customer advances to million as of december  from million as of december  resulted from payments made to third parties on behalf of our clients as well as the return of certain advances made to us on cancelled contracts 
our net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to thousand for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this change primarily resulted from decreases in billings in excess of related costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and customer advances  which was offset by decreases in our accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts net cash used by investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally due to a million reduction in the amount of cash used to complete the acquisition of remedium in compared to this was partially offset by thousand increase in the amount of property and equipment purchased in compared to purchases of property and equipment for the year ended december  included software and hardware  including host servers and computers for our corporate office and field based personnel 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  principally due to the sale of  shares of common stock in a private placement at a price of per share less applicable fees and expenses 
the company also received thousand from the exercise of employee stock options for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the year ended december  as a result of these cash flows  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million as compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the company has two significant lines of credit for its european operations 
the first credit facility amounting to thousand is with svenska handelsbanken ab with interest charged at handlesbanken avista  which at year end was approximately 
the second significant line of credit amounting to thousand is with okopankki oyj with interest charged at month euribor  which at year end was approximately 
there were no borrowings under these credit facilities at december  commitments by the banks generally expire one year from the date of the agreement and are generally renewed 
amounts were converted based on an exchange rate of eur usd the company has incurred net losses in recent years due in part to certain charges such as the amortization of intangibles  depreciation of fixed assets and share based compensation expense 
however  we believe we will be able to become a profitable business as a result of our recent acquisition of remedium oy  anticipated new business awards combined with a leaner cost structure  and a more favorable mix of future contracts 
management believes that cash on hand and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet the company s obligations for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we are not able to develop new business or existing contracts are terminated  there is a potential risk that the company will not achieve profitability and  accordingly  might not be able to meet future cash obligations 
there can be no assurance that anticipated new business will be obtained and if such business is not obtained our results of operations  financial position and cash flow could be adversely and materially affected 
off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any equity ownership interests in any variable interest entity or other minority owned ventures 
contractual obligations and commitments in august  we entered into a lease agreement for several pieces of office equipment that is being accounted for as a capital lease obligation 
this lease was recorded as an asset and in general was for peripheral office equipment 
the present value of the capital lease obligation and the corresponding asset value of the equipment acquired was thousand 
we did not enter into any capital lease obligations in or we are committed under a number of non cancelable operating leases  primarily related to office space and other office equipment 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately  for leasehold improvements  software applications  workstations  personal computer equipment and related assets 
a significant portion of our service agreement commitments  which are primarily comprised of investigator payments  are expected to be reimbursed under agreements with clients
