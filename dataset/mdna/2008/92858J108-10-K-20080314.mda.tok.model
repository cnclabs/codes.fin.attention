item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors in item a 
overview we are a leading provider of on demand software for public relations management 
our web based software suite helps organizations of all sizes fundamentally change the way they communicate with both the media and the public  optimizing their public relations and increasing their ability to measure its impact 
our on demand software addresses the critical functions of public relations including media relations  news distribution and news monitoring 
we deliver our solutions over the internet using a secure  scalable application and system architecture  which allows our customers to eliminate expensive up front hardware and software costs and to quickly deploy and adopt our on demand software 
we sell access to our on demand software primarily through our direct sales channel  and to a lesser extent through third party distributors 
as of december   we had  active subscription customers from a variety of industries  including financial and insurance  technology  healthcare and pharmaceutical and retail and consumer products  as well as government agencies  not for profit organizations and educational institutions 
we define active subscription customers as unique customer accounts that have an active subscription and have not been suspended for non payment 
additionally  we are a leading provider of online distribution of press releases 
we enable our customers to achieve visibility on the internet by distributing search engine optimized press releases directly to various news sites and the public 
we offer an on demand solution which allows our customers to widely distribute press releases containing important elements of rich media such as images  podcasts and video messages to drive internet traffic to websites and increase brand awareness 
we plan to continue the expansion of our customer base by expanding our direct and indirect distribution channels  expanding our international market penetration and selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions 
as a result  we plan to hire additional personnel  particularly in sales and professional services  and expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  increase the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and develop our operational and financial systems to manage a growing business 
we also intend to identify and acquire companies which would either expand our solution s functionality  provide access to new customers or markets  or both 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from subscription agreements and related services and from the online distribution of press releases 
our subscription agreements contain multiple service elements and deliverables  which include use of our on demand software  hosting services  content and content updates  implementation and training services and customer support 
the typical term of our subscription agreements is one year  however  our customers may purchase subscriptions with multi year terms 
we generally invoice our customers in advance of their annual subscription  with payment terms that require our customers pay us within days of invoice 
our subscription agreements are non cancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their agreements for cause if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement 
additionally  we derive revenue on a per transaction basis from the online distribution of press releases 
we generally receive payment in advance of the distribution of the press release 
professional services revenue consists primarily of data migration  training and configuration services sold separately after the initial subscription agreement 
typically  our professional service engagements are billed on a fixed fee basis with payment terms requiring our customers to pay us within days of invoice 
revenues from professional services sold separately from subscription agreements have not been material to our business 
during  professional services sold separately accounted for less than of our revenues 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of compensation for training  editorial and support personnel  hosting infrastructure  press release distribution  acquisition and amortization of content  amortization of purchased technology  amortization of capitalized software development costs  depreciation associated with computer equipment and software and allocated overhead 
we allocate overhead expenses such as employee benefits  computer supplies  depreciation for computer equipment and office supplies based on headcount 
as a result  indirect overhead expenses are included in cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
we believe content is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to broad  current and relevant information critical to their pr efforts 
we expect to continue to make investments in both our own content as well as content acquired from third parties and to continue to enhance our proprietary information database and news on demand service 
we expect that in  cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars but will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues  as we incur expenses to expand our content offerings and our capacity to support new customers 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are our largest operating expense  accounting for of our revenues 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions and incentives  marketing programs  including lead generation  events and other brand building expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time a subscription agreement is executed by the customer  and we recognize substantially all of our revenues ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur incremental sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
as our revenues increase  we plan to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase sales to our existing customers 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities in order to build brand awareness and generate additional leads for our growing sales personnel 
we expect that in  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our software application development personnel and allocated overhead 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand software 
because of our hosted  on demand model  we are able to provide all of our customers with a single  shared version of our most recent application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain legacy versions of our software  which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software business models 
we expect that in  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies  but will remain relatively consistent or increase slightly as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  administrative and management information systems personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain relatively consistent or decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortized intangible assets consist of customer relationships  a trade name and agreements not to compete acquired in business combinations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
our subscription agreements generally contain multiple service elements and deliverables 
these elements include access to our software and often specify initial services including implementation and training 
our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
our revenue recognition policy considers all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements as a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  we recognize all associated fees over the subscription period  which is typically one year 
we recognize our revenue over the subscription period because the access to our software is the last element delivered to the customer and the predominant element of our agreements 
in applying the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  we determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription to our on demand software after delivery of specified initial services 
when we sell this subscription separately from professional services the price charged varies and  therefore  we cannot objectively and reliably determine the subscription s fair value 
as a result  subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
professional services sold separately from a subscription arrangement are recognized as the services are performed 
we distribute press releases over the internet that are indexed by major search engines and distributed directly to various news sites  journalists and other key constituents 
we recognize revenue on a per transaction basis when the press releases are made available to the public 
sales commissions 
sales commissions are expensed when a subscription agreement is executed by the customer 
as a result  we incur incremental sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

our stock option awards have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date  and accordingly  any stock based compensation related to stock option grants was not material under apb no 
we applied the disclosure provisions under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related interpretations sfas no 
as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
as a result  stock based compensation expense  based upon the fair value method  was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to our financial statements for the stock based compensation awards granted after we became a public entity 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method for the unvested portion of stock based compensation awards granted after we became a public entity 
because we did not complete our initial public offering until december  we have applied the prospective method to the unvested portion of stock based compensation awards granted prior to june   the date we first filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  we have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under the prospective method  we will continue to account for stock based compensation awards granted before june  using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb no 
under the modified prospective method  stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after june   but not vested as of december   is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we used the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards granted after june  the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
in  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
we recently became a public entity  and therefore have a limited trading history 
accordingly  our expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of similar entities common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards 
the expected term of an award is based on the simplified method allowed by sab no 
 whereby the expected term is equal to the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate on us treasury zero coupon issues with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying a dividend in the foreseeable future and accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero 
changes in these assumptions can affect the estimated fair value of options granted and the related compensation expense which may significantly impact our results of operations in future periods 
stock based compensation expense recognized is based on the estimated portion of the awards that are expected to vest 
we apply estimated forfeiture rates based on analyses of historical data  including termination patterns and other factors 
as of december   we had  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation awards granted under our equity plans 
the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
business combinations 
we have completed acquisitions of businesses that have resulted in the recording of identifiable intangible assets based on the estimated fair value of those assets 
intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships  a trade name  agreements not to compete and purchased technology 
intangible assets are amortized either on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
accounting for these acquisitions requires us to make determinations about the fair value of assets acquired  including intangible assets  and liabilities assumed that involve estimates and judgments 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our intangible and other long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
an impairment charge would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset being evaluated for impairment 
any resulting impairment charge would be included in our results of operations 
impairment charges for the year ended december  were not material 
goodwill 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually on november  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of the acquired business  adverse market conditions and a variety of other circumstances 
we conducted the annual impairment test in with no resulting impairment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound sterling  because our subscription agreements from our european subsidiary are typically denominated in the british pound sterling 
revenues from subscription agreements denominated in a foreign currency were approximately  and of our total revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  exchange rate fluctuations have not significantly impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
in the future  we may utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
we do not currently have any such contracts in place  nor did we enter into any such contracts during the years ended december   or interest rate sensitivity interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
however  based on the nature and current level of our investments  which are primarily cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and debt obligations  we believe that there is no material risk of exposure
