the company s growth and the associated risks and uncertainties see item a 
risk factors made it difficult to estimate ultimate claims liabilities  and the unfavorable development occurred as the company revised previous estimates to reflect current claims data 
for  the decrease in net claims and claim adjustment expenses was primarily due to favorable development in the runoff lines which was offset to some extent with unfavorable development for the nonstandard personal automobile lines 
the following table represents the development of gaap balance sheet reserves for the years ended december  through the top line of the table shows the reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for the current and all prior years as recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
the reserves represent the estimated amount of claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in the current and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
the second portion of the following table shows the net cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year 
the third portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year  including net cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year 
for example  the liability for net claims and claim adjustment expenses of  re estimated one year later as of december  was  of which  has been paid  leaving a net reserve of  for claims and claim adjustment expenses in and prior years remaining unpaid as of december  
table of contents net cumulative deficiency redundancy represents the change in the estimate from the original balance sheet date to the date of the current estimate 
for example  the net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses indicate a  net deficiency from december  to december  one year later whereas the net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses indicate a  net redundancy from december  to december  five years later 
conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past may or may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is generally not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table

the company completes a full actuarial analysis of unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses on a quarterly basis for each of its coverage lines 
based upon this actuarial analysis and the new information that becomes available during the quarter  unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses are re estimated each quarter 
of the net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses at december  of million  is related to the company s three primary reserve coverage areas commercial general liability million  commercial auto liability million  and nonstandard personal auto million 
the remaining million relates to professional liability and miscellaneous commercial areas  which are in runoff

the selected estimates make no provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of claims or types of claims not sufficiently represented in the company s historical base or which are not yet quantifiable  and other risk factors could be identified in the future as having been a significant influence on the company s unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses

table of contents the following table presents the insurance companies claims  expense and combined ratios on a gaap basis years ended december  claims ratio expense ratio combined ratio c cae is an abbreviation for claims and claim adjustment expenses  stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the expense and combined ratios do not reflect expenses of the holding company which include interest expense on the note payable and subordinated debentures 
commissions  change in deferred acquisition costs  underwriting expenses and operating expenses insurance subsidiaries only are offset by agency revenues and are stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the holding company provides administrative and financial services for its companies and only a portion of these expenses are allocated to the insurance companies 
the allocation of the holding company s expenses solely to its insurance companies would have an impact on their results of operations and would also affect the ratios presented

rating am best is the principal rating agency of the insurance industry 
an insurance company s ability to effectively compete in the market place is in part dependent upon the rating determination of am best 
am best provides ratings of insurance companies based on comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations and expresses its rating as an opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
in december  am best affirmed the rating assignment of our insurance subsidiary of b fair with a stable outlook 
am best s assigns a b rating to companies that have  in the opinion of am best  a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders  but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions 
a b rating is the seventh out of the possible ratings 
government regulation our insurance company is subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance department of the jurisdiction in which it is domiciled or licensed to transact business 
the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
generally  an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile 
state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents  regulating premium charges and policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports  and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted 
rate regulation varies from file and use to prior approval to mandated rates 
insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards 
insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business 
insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 

table of contents insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information 
these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions  including management fees  loans  and cash advances  between regulated insurers and their affiliates 
under state insolvency and guaranty laws  regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers 
insurers are also required by many states  as a condition of doing business in the state  to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market 
these assigned risk plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks  as well as the allowable premium 
many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks 
these plans  through assessments  pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 
insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings 
although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors  including the type of business being written  the adequacy of the insurer s reserves  the quality of the insurer s assets and the identity of the regulator  the annual net premiums that an insurer may write are generally limited in relation to the insurer s total policyholders surplus 
thus  the amount of an insurer s surplus may  in certain cases  limit its ability to grow its business 
the national association of insurance commissioners the naic also has developed a risk based capital rbc program to enable regulators to carry out appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition 
the rbc program consists of a series of dynamic surplus related formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks  such as asset  credit and underwriting risks 
the company s statutory capital exceeds the benchmark capital level under the rbc formula for its insurance company 
many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  certain states limit an auto insurer s ability to cancel or non renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation or non renewal of policies and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise 
some changes may be due to economic developments  such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles  other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency 
in recent years  legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced  and in some areas adopted  which deal with use of non public consumer information  use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting  insurance rate development  rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or non renew insurance policies  reflecting concerns about consumer privacy  coverage  availability  prices and alleged discriminatory pricing 
in addition  from time to time  the us congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
in some states  the auto insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators  legislators or special interest groups to reduce  freeze  or set rates to or at a level that are not necessarily related to underlying costs  including initiatives to roll back auto and other personal lines rates 
this kind of activity has affected adversely  and in the future may affect adversely  the profitability and growth of the auto insurance business in those jurisdictions  and may limit the ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs 
adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the ability to price auto insurance adequately  or affecting the insurance operations adversely in other ways  may occur in the future 
the impact of these regulatory changes on us cannot be predicted 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed full time employees  of whom were officers and were staff and administrative personnel 
we had no part time employees 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents item a 
risk factors readers of this annual report on form k should consider the risk factors described in the following paragraphs in conjunction with the other information included herein 
see also forward looking statements appearing in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we face intense competition from other personal automobile insurance providers 
the nonstandard personal automobile insurance business is highly competitive and  except for regulatory considerations  there are relatively few barriers to entry 
we compete with both large national insurance providers and smaller regional companies 
the largest automobile insurance companies include the progressive corporation  the allstate corporation  state farm mutual automobile insurance company  geico  farmers insurance group  safeco corp  nationwide group and american international group 
our chief competitors include some of these companies as well as mercury general corporation  infinity property casualty corporation  affirmative insurance holdings  inc  united automobile insurance group  bristol west insurance group and sentry insurance group 
some of our competitors spend substantially more on advertising  have more capital  higher ratings and greater resources than we have  may offer a broader range of products  lower prices and down payments than we offer  and may pay higher commissions to agents and offer superior customer service 
some of our competitors that sell insurance policies directly to customers  rather than through agencies or brokerages as we do  may have certain competitive advantages  including increased name recognition among customers  direct relationships with policyholders and potentially lower cost structures 
in addition  it is possible that new competitors will enter the nonstandard automobile insurance market 
our loss of business to competitors could have a material impact on our growth and profitability 
further  competition could result in lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions including policy claim limits  which could reduce our underwriting margins 
we do not use credit scores in underwriting  unlike many of our competitors  which may result in additional risks in our business 
the property and casualty insurance industry has historically been characterized by cyclical periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that allow for attractive premiums and attract additional competitors 
the periods of intense price competition may adversely affect our operating results  and the overall cyclicality of the industry may cause fluctuations in our operating results and affect our ability to manage the business profitably 
our failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies 
many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately  including but not limited to the training and experience of our claims representatives  our claims organization s culture and the effectiveness of our management  our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors 
our failure to pay claims timely and accurately could lead to material litigation  undermine our reputation in the marketplace  impair our image and materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  if we do not train new claims employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims employees our claims department s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected 
in addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets  we could suffer in decreased quality of claims work  which in turn could lower our operating margins 
we have recently made significant operational changes in management of our claims administration to accelerate the recognition and resolution of claims 
these changes may result in an increase in the amount of aggregate claim settlements and cause our ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense to increase in comparison to prior periods 

table of contents we rely on information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  make claims payments and facilitate billings  collections and cancellations 
these systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development 
the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business 
because our information technology and telecommunication systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
if sustained or repeated  a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner 
this outcome could result in a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our profitability and financial condition are affected by the availability of reinsurance 
we utilize catastrophe reinsurance to transfer or cede a portion of the risks related to our nonstandard automobile insurance business through reinsurance arrangements with third parties 
the amount  availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions that are beyond our control 
these conditions affect our level of business and profitability 
we have used reinsurance to dispose of certain of our discontinued and runoff businesses 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred  it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
at december   we had approximately million in reinsurance receivables  comprised primarily of reserves for future claim payments 
approximately of these receivables were concentrated with reinsurers  all of which were companies rated a or better by am best and two companies with a b rating owed approximately of the reinsurance receivables 
six companies with a nr am best rating owed approximately of the reinsurance receivables 
the failure of reinsurers to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all would adversely affect our results of operations 
reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the risks ceded 
we are subject to credit risks with respect to the reinsurers because ceding risks to reinsurers does not relieve our insurance subsidiary s ultimate liability to its insureds 
the insolvency of any reinsurer or the inability of a reinsurer to make payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 
our business is subject to financial and operational risks resulting from our growth 
we limited our business to florida until the fourth quarter of  when we began writing nonstandard personal automobile insurance policies in texas 
in  we began writing nonstandard personal automobile insurance policies in arizona and nevada and in initiated a california program with an independent managing general agency 
we entered the south carolina market in and the new mexico market in significant growth has been realized as a result of these expansion activities  which has increased our operating leverage  claims ratio and the overall financial and operating risk profile 
we may expand to additional states in the future 

table of contents our strategy necessarily entails increased financial and operational risks and other challenges that are greater than and different from those to which we have previously been subject in writing nonstandard personal automobile insurance 
these risks and challenges include  but are not limited to  the following competitive conditions for our product have intensified recently  and further pressures on pricing are anticipated  generally  new business initially produces higher claim ratios than more seasoned in force business  and this factor is likely to be magnified to the extent that we enter multiple new states and market areas within a short period of time 
furthermore  it amplifies the importance of our ability to assess any new trends accurately and respond effectively  pricing decisions in new states and markets  involving different claims environments  distribution sources and customer demographics  must be made without the same level of experience and data that is available in existing markets  our growth has required additional personnel resources  including management and technical underwriting  claims and servicing personnel  relationships with agents and vendors with whom we have not previously done business  and additional dependence on operating systems and technology  and if we grow significantly or if adverse underwriting results occur  additional capital may be required  and such capital may not be available on favorable or acceptable terms 
our ability to maintain sufficient capital and perform successfully will be important factors in determination of our am best rating  and a reduction in that rating could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our ability to manage these risks and challenges will determine in large part whether we can operate profitably 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business 
financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and may be expected to have an effect on an insurance company s sales 
an insurance company s ability to effectively compete in the marketplace is in part dependent upon the rating determination of am best  the principal rating agency of the insurance industry 
am best provides ratings of insurance companies based on comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations and expresses its rating as an opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
in december  am best affirmed the rating assignment of our insurance subsidiary of b fair with a stable outlook 
am best assigns b and b ratings to companies that have  in the opinion of am best  a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders  but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions 
if we do not successfully implement our business plan  if the risks we describe materially and adversely affect our results or financial position or if our written premiums exceed levels deemed prudent by am best  we would face the risk of a downgrade by am best 
a downgrade in our rating may cause our independent agents to limit or stop their marketing of our products and may limit that availability and materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and the terms of capital to us 
our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 
our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for the risks we underwrite 
rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset claims  claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

table of contents our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation the availability of sufficient reliable data  our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data  our ability to recognize changes in trends in a timely manner and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  our ability to project changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable certainty  the development  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and marketing initiatives  and the success of those innovations  our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices  changing driving patterns  unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy  unanticipated changes in automobile repair costs  automobile parts prices and used car prices  and timely approval of proposed rates by regulatory agencies 
such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale  inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  we could underprice risks  which would negatively affect our margins  or we could overprice risks  which could reduce our volume and competitiveness 
in either event  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
insurance agents improper use of authority may materially affect our business 
as of december   we marketed our products and services through over  independent agency locations in arizona  florida  nevada  new mexico  south carolina and texas and one independent general agency in california that markets through approximately  insurance broker locations 
these agents have the ability to bind us with respect to insurance coverage issued on our behalf 
since the agents are independent  we have only limited ability to exercise control over these agents 
in the event that an agent exceeds its authority by binding us on a risk that does not comply with our underwriting guidelines  we are at risk for that policy until we receive the application and effect a cancellation 
this may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to comprehensive laws and regulations  and our results may be unfavorably impacted by these laws and regulations or by changes in them 
we are subject to comprehensive laws and governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than the shareholders and other investors of the insurance companies 
these regulations  administered by the department of insurance in each state in which we do business  relate to  among other things establishing mandatory minimum policy limits and coverages  approval of policy forms  rates and rating methodologies  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements developed by the national association of insurance commissioners  or the naic  and used by state insurance regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends  restrictions on transactions between the insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of operations and finances  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition to be filed  requiring reserves for unearned premium  claims and other purposes  sales plans and practices and commission structures  permitted advertising  and market conduct 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
insurance regulations and regulators have an impact on a number of factors that could affect our ability to respond to changes in our competitive environment and which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these factors include regulating our ability to exit a book of business or to exit a state in which we have been producing insurance  our ability to receive adequate premiums to achieve acceptable profitability levels  and the amount of statutory dividends from our subsidiaries which may be needed to pay expenses and dividends 
failure to maintain risk based capital at the required levels or ratios within the naic s usual range could adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to secure regulatory approvals as necessary or appropriate and would materially adversely affect their general business  ability to operate and overall financial condition 

table of contents our business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including violations of regulations 
changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
state statutes limit the aggregate amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay us  thereby limiting our funds to pay expenses and dividends 
litigation may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as a property and casualty insurance company  we are subject to various claims and litigation seeking damages and penalties  based upon  among other things  payments for claims we have denied and other monetary damages 
in some cases  plaintiffs seek to recover damages far in excess of our policy limits based on assertions of extra contractual liability due to alleged bad faith in the manner in which we have handled particular claims 
in some jurisdictions in which we operate  allegations of bad faith are frequently made and can be difficult to defend 
some litigation against us could take the form of class action complaints 
as automobile insurance industry practices and regulatory  judicial and consumer conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge  such as a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting automobile insurers in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling practices and regulatory noncompliance 
these issues can have a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or the way we are permitted to price products  limiting the factors we may consider when we underwrite risks  or by requiring us to change our claims handling procedures or our practices for charging fees  or by increasing the size of claims or resulting in other monetary damages 
the damages and penalties in these types of matters can be substantial 
the relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory  statutory and punitive damages 
the office of the new york attorney general and other state attorneys general are investigating certain insurance industry practices 
the investigations appear to center around practices by which other insurance companies paid contingent compensation to insurance brokers based on the volume or profitability of the insurance placed with the insurance company for their clients  allegedly in violation of the brokers duty to act in the best interest of their clients rather than their own undisclosed pecuniary interest 
we have not been named in these investigations and ensuing legislation  however  we may become involved at some point in the future 
the expenses and other effects of potential litigation on our business  financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted and may be material 
several of our competitors are named as defendants in a number of putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of their insurance business operations 
these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of after market parts  total loss evaluation methodology  the use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act  the methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury  personal injury protection and medical payment claims  methods of imposing finance charges on installment premiums  and policy implementation and renewal procedures  among other matters 
litigation may be filed against us and or our subsidiaries or disputes may arise in the future concerning these or other business practices 
from time to time  we also may be involved in such litigation or other disputes alleging that our business practices violate the patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  lawsuits have been filed  and other lawsuits may be filed in the future  against our competitors and other businesses  and although we are not a party to such litigation  the results of those cases may create additional risks for  and or impose additional costs and or limitations on  our subsidiaries business operations 

table of contents lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages  and we were sued in and in putative class actions similar to some of those referred to above 
moreover  as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields  a new layer of court imposed regulation could emerge  resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 
such litigation is inherently unpredictable 
we are unable to predict the effect  if any  that these pending or future lawsuits may have on the business  operations  profitability or financial condition 
an adverse resolution of the litigation pending or threatened against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and could cause our operating results in reporting periods to fluctuate significantly 
the nonstandard insurance business may become subject to adverse publicity  which may negatively impact our financial condition 
negative publicity arising from attention of consumer advocacy groups  the media or other sources may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation  which could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by competitive  regulatory or economic conditions that influence the automobile insurance industry in general 
driving patterns  inflation in the cost of automobile repairs and medical care  and increasing litigation of liability claims are some of the more important factors that affect claim trends  and other nonstandard automobile insurers are generally unable to increase premiums unless permitted by regulators  typically after the costs associated with the coverage have increased 
accordingly  profit margins generally decline in a period of increasing claim costs  and we may be unable to sustain our policies in force 
in addition  declines in economic activity may adversely affect the demand for our policies or the ability of our customers to make payments 
catastrophic losses could have a material  adverse effect on our business 
catastrophic losses could occur either as a result of insurance claims or because of interruption in our ability to conduct business efficiently 
property and casualty insurance companies are subject to claims arising from natural and man made catastrophes that may have a significant impact on their business  results of operations and financial condition 
catastrophic losses can be caused by a wide variety of events  including hurricanes  tropical storms  tornadoes  wind  hail  fires  riots  terrorism and explosions  and their incidence and severity are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of claims from a catastrophe is a function of two factors the total amount of an insurance company s exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
our policyholders are currently concentrated in geographic areas that are periodically subject to adverse weather and other conditions 
accordingly  the occurrence of a catastrophe in the states in which we operate or in which we may operate in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
separately  a catastrophic interruption of our technology systems could disrupt our operations or prevent us from providing acceptable customer service or managing other aspects of our business effectively 

table of contents our claim and claim adjustment expense may exceed our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our financial statements include claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for reported and unreported claims which represent our best estimate of what we will ultimately pay on claims and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of our financial statements 
when available  we rely heavily on our historical claim and claim adjustment experience in determining these reserves 
we may not have historical results for new markets and our relatively small size results in our having less data available than many of our competitors 
in addition  the historic development of reserves for claim and claim adjustment expense may not accurately reflect future trends 
for example  these estimates are subject to large potential errors because the ultimate disposition of claims incurred before the date of our financial statements  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred  such as jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes  subsequent damage to property  changes in the medical condition of claimants  public attitudes and economic conditions such as inflation  new classes of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in historical data are not yet identifiable  and our inability to predict future events 
our expansion into new markets and states increases the risk that our reserves do not accurately reflect the ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense that we will incur 
there may also be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of an event and the time it is reported to us 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating our reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
we have recently made significant operational changes in the claims adjustment process and in our methodology for managing and tracking claims data  and these changes increase the uncertainties which exist in the estimation process and could lead to inaccurate estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops and claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the period in which such estimates are changed 
there are significant risks and uncertainties that could result in material adverse deviation of our unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the amount of actual claim and claim adjustment expense that we pay to claimants may be substantially more than the reserves reflected in our financial statements and could therefore cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from one reporting period to another 
our debt service obligations could impede our operations  flexibility and financial performance 
our level of debt could affect our financial performance 
as of december   we had consolidated indebtedness other than trade payables and certain other short term debt of million 
in addition  borrowings under our credit agreement and the capital securities issued gainsco capital trust i and gainsco statutory trust ii  which were organized by the company  bear interest at rates that fluctuate 
the capital trust and statutory trust are not consolidated with the company 
therefore  increases in interest rates on the obligations under our credit agreement and the capital securities would adversely affect our income and cash flow that would be available for the payment of interest and principal on the loans under our credit agreement 
our net interest expense for the year ended december  was  
table of contents our level of debt could have important consequences  including the following we will need to use a portion of the money we earn to pay principal and interest on outstanding amounts due under our credit facility  which will reduce the amount of money available to us for financing our operations and other business activities  we may have a much higher level of debt than certain of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage  we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future  and we could be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we continue to expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt from our operations 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt service obligations thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  demographic and other factors  including competition 
if we do not have enough money to pay our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity 
in that event  we may not be able to refinance our debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains various operating covenants  including among other things  restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on and redeem capital stock  make other restricted payments  including investments  sell our assets and enter into consolidations  mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets 
these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that require funds in excess of those available to us 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that we will meet those ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants  ratios  tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under the credit facility 
if an event of default exists under the credit facility  the lender could elect to declare all outstanding amounts immediately due and payable 
if the lender under our credit facility accelerates the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness that would become due as a result of such acceleration 
we may need to raise additional capital 
we may need additional capital to continue growing our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital 
if we are unable to obtain required capital on favorable terms  or at all  we may be forced to change our business plan and may be unable to respond to competitive pressures in our business 
even if we are able to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of existing investors 
in addition  if we raise capital through senior credit facilities  we would experience risks typically associated with credit borrowings  such as risks of defaults that we are unable to cure  enforcement of any liens or other security interests we may grant and restrictions on our operations  including those that might be required to comply with any financial and non financial covenants 
additional capital could also be dilutive to our common shareholders and result in significantly higher interest expense and indebtedness  thereby reducing the earnings available to common shareholders 

table of contents a change in immigration policies could adversely affect our growth 
we believe that a majority of our current and potential customers is hispanic  and a key element of our growth strategy involves our continued focus on marketing our nonstandard automobile insurance in this market niche 
an important element to this strategy is our belief that a growing percentage of potential customers for personal nonstandard automobile insurance are hispanic 
in recent years  there have been a variety of legislative proposals to limit immigration to the united states or make other policy changes that may be adverse to undocumented immigrants 
if one or more proposals were to be adopted and had the effect of curtailing such immigration or imposing additional requirements on immigrants requiring insurance  this could result in decline in growth of the hispanic market  which may have an adverse effect on our abilities to achieve our growth strategies and our ability to expand our business in the markets in which we currently operate and may operate in the future 
the performance of our portfolio of fixed income and equity securities may affect our profitability  capitalization and financial performance 
we maintain an investment portfolio that currently consists primarily of fixed income securities 
the quality  market value  yield and liquidity of the portfolio may be affected by a number of factors  including the general economic and business environment  changes in the credit quality of the issuer of the fixed income securities  changes in market conditions or disruptions in particular markets  changes in interest rates  or regulatory changes 
these securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer 
factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer  a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer s industry  deterioration in the cash flows or the quality of assets of the issuer  or a change in the issuer s marketplace may adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest from the issuer 
both equity and fixed income securities have been affected over the past several years  and may be affected in the future  by significant external events 
examples of such events would include the september terrorist attacks  hurricanes  corporate accounting scandals and temporary or long term disruptions in markets 
credit rating downgrades  defaults  and impairments may result in write downs in the value of the fixed income securities held by the company 
as of december   we held million of fixed income securities  million of which were rated below bbb based on standard poor s credit ratings 
the investments our insurance company subsidiary holds are highly regulated by specific legislation in texas that governs the type  amount  and credit quality of allowable investments  and the fixed income securities in which we invest are evaluated by the naic s security valuation office the svo 
legislative changes or changes in the svo s evaluations could force us to adjust investment carrying values  with a resulting adverse effect on the level of our statutory capital 
we may use derivative instruments that are hedging in nature in order to manage our interest rate and equity market risk 
although we take precautions to minimize our exposure  our profitability may be adversely affected if a counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults in its payment 
failure to successfully resolve our remaining commercial lines claims could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
on february   we announced our decision to cease writing commercial insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
as a result  there are no commercial policies remaining in force at december  we continue to settle and reduce our inventory of commercial lines claims 
at december   there were claims associated with our runoff book outstanding  compared to at december  due to the long tail and litigious nature of these claims  we anticipate that it will take a substantial number of years to complete the adjustment and settlement process with regard to existing claims and the additional claims we expect to receive in the future from our past business writings 
most of the remaining claims are in litigation and our future results may be impacted negatively if we are unable to resolve the remaining claims and new anticipated claims within our established reserve level 

table of contents our success depends on retaining our current key personnel and attracting additional personnel 
our success will depend largely on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management  especially those of robert w 
stallings  our chairman of the board and chief strategic officer  glenn w 
anderson  our president  chief executive officer and director and james r 
reis  our executive vice president 
our business may be adversely affected if the services of these officers or any of our other key personnel become unavailable to us 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
stallings  anderson and reis 
even with these employment agreements  there is a risk that these individuals will not continue to serve for any particular period of time 
we may hire additional key employees and officers to support our business growth  our focus on the nonstandard personal automobile insurance business  our expansion into new geographic markets and the improvement and enhancement of our systems and technologies 
hiring management personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary skills  experience and understanding of our business procedures and the necessary leadership ability to guide us through the strategic development initiatives contemplated in the immediate years ahead 
in  we adopted a new long term focused system of performance based equity compensation for key personnel 
pursuant to such plan  the compensation committee  all of whose members are independent  is authorized to offer performance based incentive grants and potentially issue up to of our outstanding common stock over time based on achievement of performance targets 
as of december   there were outstanding  restricted stock units which could be earned through by the achievement of specified performance criteria 
our operating performance and recently lower stock price may affect the efficacy of the incentives 
our inability to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified personnel that our business needs may cause our business and prospects to suffer 
we cannot be certain that the net operating loss tax carryforwards will continue to be available to offset our tax liability 
as of december   we had net operating loss tax carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which we refer to as nols  of approximately  in order to utilize the nols  we must generate taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the nols will expire if not used 
the availability of nols to offset taxable income would be substantially reduced if we were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
we will be treated as having had an ownership change if  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder  there is more than a change in stock ownership during a three year testing period by shareholders 
the nols will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and we cannot assure you that we would prevail if the irs were to challenge the availability of the nols 
if the irs were successful in challenging our nols  all or some portion of the nols would not be available to offset any future consolidated income 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  and the volume of trading in our common stock is very low 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of insurance companies  including nonstandard automobile insurance companies  have been especially volatile 
such fluctuations can result from  among other things quarterly variations in operating results  changes in market valuations of other similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of new products  contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  
table of contents additions or departures of key personnel  significant sales of common stock by insiders or others or the perception that such sales could occur  general economic trends and conditions  deterioration in the trading market for our common stock  and future issuances of stock or debt securities to fund our anticipated growth 
in addition  the stock market has periodically experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall and could negatively affect an investment in our common stock regardless of our performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock  including us  have been the object of securities class action litigation 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
certain of our executives and directors own a majority of our outstanding capital stock  and therefore exercise voting control over the company 
our executive officers and directors  together with our largest shareholder  beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock as of december  
they potentially have the power to control the actions of the company with respect to items requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws  and the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
their interests in approving such actions might not be aligned with the interests of other owners of our common stock

business operations overview the company is engaged in the property and casualty insurance business through its insurance company and managing general agency subsidiaries 
insurance operations include ongoing nonstandard personal auto insurance and the runoff of the commercial lines business  which was discontinued in the principal sources of revenues for the company are premiums on nonstandard personal auto insurance  net investment income from the company s investment portfolio and fee income from insurance agency operations 
following development of a larger and more diverse franchise in and  which resulted in significant premium growth  the company encountered challenges in despite efforts to operate profitably  the emergence of a claims ratio higher than previously estimated  resulting primarily from our rapid growth  caused a loss for the year ended december  throughout  the company implemented actions to address these challenges and improve the claims and expense ratios  including the following implementation of multiple rate increases in most markets to attempt to strengthen pricing adequacy while maintaining desirable business segments  adoption of market initiatives to eliminate sources of unprofitable business  whether derived from specific markets or coverages or originated by agents with identifiable unprofitable business  upgrade of claims systems  procedures and personnel  including practices intended to accelerate the recognition and resolution of exposure throughout the claims process  from initial recording of claims to their ultimate resolution  continuing consolidation of functions and personnel in the dallas headquarters office  to reduce expenses where practicable while maintaining or improving customer service  deferral of entry into new markets  and continued settlement of runoff claims in an orderly manner 
we also sold a former subsidiary general agents  which is not utilized in the nonstandard personal automobile business  in a transaction in which the company realized a net gain of million 
net premiums earned were million and million in and  respectively  and gross premiums written were million and million in and  respectively 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared with net income of million for the year ended december  as of december   the statutory surplus was million  as compared with million as of december  the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses stood at million and million at december  and  respectively  of which unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses attributable to ongoing nonstandard personal automobile lines was million and million  respectively 

table of contents the company limited its nonstandard personal auto insurance business to florida until the fourth quarter of  when it began writing policies in texas 
the company began writing policies in arizona and nevada in  in california  with an independent managing general agency  in  and in south carolina in  and we entered new mexico in the first quarter of the company markets its policies through  independent agency locations in arizona  florida  nevada  new mexico  south carolina and texas and one general agency in california that markets through approximately  insurance broker locations 
beginning in  significant growth has been realized as a result of these expansion activities  which has increased the operating leverage  the claims ratio and the overall financial and operational risk profile of the company 
the following table presents selected financial information in thousands of dollars years ended december  gross premiums written net premiums earned net loss income before federal income taxes federal income tax expense benefit net loss income net loss income available to common shareholders gaap c cae ratio gaap expense ratio gaap combined ratio c cae is an abbreviation for claims and claim adjustment expenses  stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the expense and combined ratios do not reflect expenses of the holding company which include interest expense on the note payable and subordinated debentures 
commissions  change in deferred acquisition costs  underwriting expenses and operating expenses insurance subsidiaries only are offset by agency revenues and are stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the increase in the c cae ratio in was primarily due to unfavorable development for claims occurring in prior accident years on the nonstandard personal auto lines offset by favorable development in the run off lines 
the expense ratio declined primarily due to policy acquisition costs specifically due to decreases in commission rates  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses 
the company believes it is pursuing a strategy that has the potential to build a substantially larger  competitively distinctive and successful franchise in the nonstandard personal auto business over time and is endeavoring to manage its investments and risks to achieve this result 
these risks and other challenges  occurring in rapidly changing economic  competitive  regulatory and claims environments  are greater than and in some cases different from those to which the company has previously been subject in writing nonstandard personal auto insurance 
the company s operating and financial results vary from period to period as a result of numerous factors inherent in the insurance business  many of which are affected by such changes 
until  the company limited its growth due primarily to capital constraints 
however  capital restructuring transactions  along with key investments in operations  have permitted management to pursue a more aggressive  geographically diversified expansion plan beginning in in the first quarter of  the company issued million of year subordinated debentures  which enabled the company to redeem its outstanding series a preferred stock due in january  and provided additional capital of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company issued million of year subordinated debentures  which the company used for general corporate purposes 
see capital transaction subordinated debentures 

table of contents discontinuance of commercial lines on february   the company announced its decision to cease writing commercial insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
the discontinuance of writing commercial lines resulted in the company ceasing to be approved to write insurance in several states  however  this state action has not materially restricted the geographic expansion of the company s nonstandard personal auto lines thus far 
the company continues to settle and reduce its inventory of commercial lines claims 
at december   there were claims associated with the company s runoff book outstanding  compared to as of december  as of december   in respect of its runoff lines  the company had million in net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses c cae compared to million as of december  for the periods presented  the company has recorded favorable development in unpaid c cae from the runoff lines with the settlement and reduction in the inventory of commercial lines claims 
see results of operations claims and claim adjustment expenses 
due to the long tail and litigious nature of these claims  the company anticipates it will take a substantial number of years to complete the adjustment and settlement process with regard to existing claims and the additional claims it expects to receive in the future from its past business writings 
most of the remaining claims are in suit and the company s future results may or may not be impacted either negatively or positively based on its ability to settle the remaining claims and new anticipated claims within its established reserve level

gross premiums written in decreased as compared to as a result of rate increases and selective reduction in the agency force to reduce unprofitable business 
the following table presents gross premiums written by region in thousands of dollars for the years ending december  region southeast florida  south carolina south central texas southwest arizona  new mexico  nevada west california total each of the regions  except for southwest  recorded premium declines in from the percent of premium decrease increase by region for from is as follows southeast  south central  southwest and west 
planned rate increases and selective reduction in the agency force to reduce unprofitable business are the main reasons for the decrease in the gross written premiums  which resulted in the policies in force declining  except for the southwest region 
in the southwest region  where rates remained stable  the agency force grew and marketing efforts were increased which accounts for their increase in gross premiums written 
net premiums earned increased in over primarily as a result of the growth in gross premiums written in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of over their respective prior year quarters 

table of contents net investment income increased  in primarily due to the increase in average investments and the increase in bonds available for sale  which provide higher returns than short term investments

in november  the company completed the sale of general agents and recorded a net gain of  see significant corporate transactions sale of general agents 
variability in the timing of net realized capital gains and losses should be expected 
agency revenues increased  in primarily as a result of the increase in writings in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of over their respective prior years quarters 
agency revenues are primarily fees charged on insureds premiums due 
other income has decreased in as a result of the continued runoff of the commercial auto claims under the reserve reinsurance cover agreement 
this item is primarily comprised of recognition of the deferred reinsurance gain from the reserve reinsurance cover agreement

claims and claim adjustment expenses increased  in and the c cae ratio was in versus in the runoff lines recorded favorable development for prior accident years of approximately  and  during and  respectively 
the c cae ratio for nonstandard personal auto was and for and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to unfavorable development for claims occurring in prior accident years of approximately  which includes  for extra contractual claims  as described below 
the following presents the unfavorable development for the three major regions and includes development for defense and cost containment expenses but does not include development for adjustment and other expenses southeast region primarily florida  south central region texas  southwest region primarily arizona and nevada   of these increases is attributable to bodily injury liability coverage 
approximately  relates to the accident year 
new business and the entry into new territories and product lines  associated with the company s growth beginning in  has generally produced higher claims and greater uncertainty in determining reserves than more seasoned in force business  see item a 
risk factors 
the unfavorable development for prior accident years for nonstandard personal auto in is primarily the result of actual and projected increases in severity associated with bodily injury liability 
the company s growth and the associated risks and uncertainties see item a 
risk factors made it difficult to estimate ultimate claims liabilities  and the unfavorable development occurred as the company revised previous estimates to reflect current claims data 
the unfavorable development for prior accident years includes approximately  for relating to obligations and potential claims exposure relating to extra contractual claims  in which claimants seek to recover amounts significantly in excess of applicable policy limits 
in  the company had incurred several extra contractual claims primarily related to claims occurring in prior accident years 
see item a  risk factors litigation may affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claims for extra contractual liability arise when a claim is originally denied or the claimant asserts that a claim has been handled inappropriately  and the claimant further asserts that such denial or allegedly inappropriate response was improper or in bad faith 
in such cases  which tend to arise in cases involving serious injury or death  it is not unusual for the amount of the claim to exceed by a substantial amount the policy limits that would otherwise be applicable 
where the company becomes aware of such a potential claim  it typically consults with outside counsel and  if appropriate  seeks to settle the claim on terms as favorable as possible in light of all the relevant circumstances 
the amounts required for settlement of such claims  and the potential award if a case cannot be settled on acceptable terms  vary widely depending on the specific facts of the claim  the applicable law and other factors 

table of contents during  the company began implementing improved claim practices in each of the major regions claims departments in order to seek to ultimately decrease the average time from when a claim occurs to when it is settled 
the company believes that  over the long term  timeliness in the settlement of claims is likely to produce the most favorable claim results for the company 
however  when this practice is initially implemented  it can cause an increase in the c cae and introduce greater uncertainty into the process of setting reserves 
these operational changes may result in an increase in the amount of aggregate claim settlements and cause our ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense to increase in comparison to prior accident years 
with regard to environmental and product liability claims  the company has an immaterial amount of exposure 
the company did not provide environmental impairment coverage and excluded pollution and asbestos related coverages in its policies 
a portion of the company s remaining claims is related to construction defects 
inflation impacts the company by causing higher claim settlements than may have originally been estimated 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
policy acquisition costs include commission expense  change in deferred policy acquisition costs  premium taxes  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses 
the decrease of  in is primarily due to decreases in commission rates  marketing expenses and underwriting expenses and a premium deficiency charge  net of anticipated investment income  of  for expected underwriting losses on the south central business 
the decrease in premiums written also contributed to the decrease in policy acquisition costs 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned was and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned in was primarily due to decreases in commission rates  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses 
underwriting and operating expenses increased  in from primarily due to an increase in advertising  underwriting reports  employment fees and actuarial and information technology consulting fees as a result of enhancing marketing  underwriting and pricing functions 
underwriting and operating expenses as a percent of net premiums earned and agency revenues were for and for the increase in interest expense is primarily related to the million of subordinated debentures issued in december see capital transaction subordinated debentures

capital transactions rights offering in november  the company completed a rights offering which raised approximately million in net proceeds 
the common stock available through the rights offering  which included an over subscription privilege  was fully subscribed 
primarily as a result of this rights offering  the number of shares of common stock outstanding increased from  as of december  to  as of december

table of contents as a result of losses in prior years  as of december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes aggregating  these net operating loss carryforwards of     and  if not utilized  will expire in    and  respectively 
as of december   the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards was  which is calculated by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of against the net operating loss carryforwards of  the  that will expire in was generated in the company considers available evidence  both objective and subjective  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  management s analysis of available evidence  both objective and subjective  concluded it was more likely than not that additional portions of this asset would be used in future periods so the valuation allowance was reduced by million  producing a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of the company required both sufficient capital to support its expanded operations and cover fixed costs and evidence that business written could achieve margins comparable to those found in other property and casualty insurers before it was appropriate to reduce the valuation allowance relating to net operating loss carryforwards 
until the fourth quarter of  such evidence was not available 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the amount of the valuation allowance by  resulting in an allowance on the gross deferred tax asset of  in making this determination  the company considered all available evidence  including the fact that the company incurred a taxable loss in and had incurred  as of december   a cumulative taxable loss for the three years then ended  which was not the case as of september  the company increased the amount of the valuation allowance by  in previous quarters of as of december  and  the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance was  and  and the valuation allowance was  and  respectively

the short term investments and cash are intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without selling fixed maturity investments 
at december   the insurance subsidiary held short term investments and cash that the insurance subsidiary believes is at adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and other short term commitments 
with regard to liquidity  the average duration of the investment portfolio is approximately year 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at december  was  below amortized cost  before taxes 
unrealized losses were not material at december  see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this report

net cash used for operating activities was  for versus cash provided by operating activities of  for the increase in cash used for operating activities in was primarily attributable to the increase in c cae payments for nonstandard personal auto 
the cash provided for was primarily attributable to the growth in premium writings in investments and cash decreased in primarily as a result of cash used for operations for the payment of claims

table of contents in early  several bond insurers had their credit ratings downgraded or placed under review by the major nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
these downgrades were as a result of a perceived weakening by the rating agencies of the insurers financial strength as a result of losses these insurers incurred from mortgage backed and asset backed securities they had insured that were experiencing increased delinquencies and defaults from weakening of the economy in general and weakening within the housing market in particular 
in light of the market conditions  during  we performed a detailed review of our asset backed securities to identify the extent to which our asset values may have been impacted by direct exposure to the subprime mortgage loan disruption  as well as broader credit market events 
certain of our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by residential mortgage loans that are considered subprime 
the cost and fair value of these securities totaled  and  at december   respectively 
our practice for acquiring and monitoring subprime mortgage backed securities takes into consideration the quality of the originator  quality of the servicer  security credit rating  underlying characteristics of the mortgages  borrower characteristics  level or credit enhancement in the transaction  and bond insurer strength  where applicable 
all of our subprime securities are rated investment grade 
of this amount  has a based standard and poor s rating of aaa  and the remaining an a rating 
we have  of our securities in alt a securities  which are nonprime collateralized mortgage obligations 
the cost and fair value of these investments were  and  respectively  at december  the company expects to receive all payments on these securities in accordance with their original contractual term as the securities approach their maturity dates or sooner if market yield for such securities decline 
the company has determined that none of the subprime securities are impaired because of credit quality or because of any company or industry specific event 
based on management s evaluation and intent  none of the unrealized losses are considered other than temporary 
premiums receivable decreased due to the decrease in premium writings 
this balance is comprised primarily of premiums due from insureds 
most of the policies are written with a down payment and monthly payment terms of up to four months on six month policies 
the company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of december  and  respectively  which it considers adequate 
the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was due primarily to the decrease in writings 
ceded unpaid c cae decreased as a result of the settlement of commercial claims subject to the commercial excess casualty and quota share reinsurance agreements 
this balance represents unpaid c cae which have been ceded to reinsurers under the company s various reinsurance agreements  other than the reserve reinsurance cover agreement 
these amounts are not currently due from the reinsurers but could become due in the future when the company pays the claim and requests reimbursement from the reinsurers 
deferred policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses which are deferred 
deferred policy acquisition costs decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in writings  reduced commission rates  decreases in marketing expenses and in some underwriting expenses 
the company also recorded a premium deficiency  net of anticipated investment income  of  in against deferred policy acquisition costs for expected underwriting losses on the south central business 
deferred federal income taxes is comprised of temporary differences and the tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards less a valuation allowance that reduces the net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax asset 
the company considered it appropriate to fully reserve the valuation allowance  see liquidity and capital resources net operating loss carryforwards 
funds held by reinsured company is primarily comprised of amounts held in trust by various insurance departments for the benefit of general agents 
under the terms of the sale  general agents is obligated to return these amounts to the company when they are released by the insurance department 

table of contents unpaid c cae decreased primarily as a result of the settlement of claims in the normal course and favorable development in from the runoff lines  which were offset with unfavorable development recorded for the nonstandard personal automobile lines 
as of december   the company had  in net unpaid c cae unpaid c cae of  less ceded unpaid c cae of 
this amount represents management s best estimate of the ultimate liabilities 
the significant operational changes we have recently made in the nonstandard personal auto claims adjustment process and changing claims trends increase the uncertainties which exist in the estimation process and could lead to inaccurate estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense 
the reserve estimates were made each quarter by our in house actuarial staff and reviewed by an independent actuarial firm 
we do not rely upon the review by the independent actuarial firm to determine the amount of our gaap reserves 
however  the analysis provided by the independent actuarial firm was used to corroborate the reserve selections made by the in house actuarial staff 
our independent actuarial firm also provides annual opinions related to adequacy of the statutory reserves for the insurance company subsidiary 
as of december  and  in respect of its runoff lines  the company had  and  respectively  in net unpaid c cae 
historically  the company has experienced significant volatility in its reserve projections for its commercial lines 
this volatility has been primarily attributable to its commercial automobile and general liability product lines 
on february   the company announced it had decided to discontinue writing commercial lines insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
the company has been settling and reducing its remaining inventory of commercial claims 
see business operations discontinuance of commercial lines 
as of december   runoff claims remained versus at december  the average runoff claim reserve was approximately  per claim and  per claim at december  and december   respectively 
unearned premiums decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in premium writings  mentioned previously 
premiums payable  commissions payable and reinsurance balances payable all decreased primarily due to a reinsurance fronting arrangement that was reducing throughout retained deficit increased as a result of net loss 
the company s statutory capital exceeds the benchmark capital level under the risk based capital formula for its insurance company 
risk based capital is a method for establishing the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 

table of contents investments bonds available for sale are stated at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
short term investments are stated at cost 
the specific identification method is used to determine costs of investments sold 
provisions for possible losses are recorded only when the values have experienced impairment considered other than temporary by a charge to realized losses resulting in a new cost basis of the investment 
the company regularly monitors its portfolio for pricing changes  which might indicate potential impairments  and performs reviews of securities with unrealized losses 
in such cases  changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer  such as financial conditions  business prospects or other factors  or ii market related factors  such as interest rates 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of variability of estimates 
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses which are deferred 
policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing expenses  some underwriting expenses and the change in deferred policy acquisition costs that are charged to operations over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
the company utilizes investment income when assessing recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected claims and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
at december   a premium deficiency  net of anticipated investment income  was recognized of approximately  against deferred policy acquisition costs for expected underwriting losses on the south central business 
at december   there was no premium deficiency 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
the goodwill recorded is related to the acquisition of the lalande group 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but rather is subject to an annual impairment test  or earlier if certain factors are present  based on its estimated fair value 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in future periods 
these procedures require gan to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  compare the results to its carrying value and record the amount of any shortfall as an impairment charge 
gan performed this test as of december  and  using a variety of methods  including estimates of future discounted cash flows 
the test results indicated that there was no impairment loss at december  or unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses an insurance company generally makes claims payments as a result of accidents involving the risks insured under the insurance policies it issues 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an accident  reporting of the accident to the insurer and payment of the claim 
insurers record a liability for estimates of claims that will be paid for accidents reported to them  which are referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported promptly upon occurrence and because the assessment of existing known claims may change over time with the development of new facts  circumstances and conditions  insurers estimate liabilities for such items  which are referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 

table of contents we maintain reserves for the payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses for both case and ibnr under policies written by the insurance company subsidiary 
these claims reserves are estimates  at a given point in time  of amounts that we expect to pay on incurred claims based on facts and circumstances then known 
the amount of case claims reserves is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of claim 
the amount of ibnr claims reserves is estimated on the basis of historical information and anticipated future conditions by lines of insurance and actuarial review 
reserves for claim adjustment expenses are intended to cover the ultimate costs of settling claims  including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
the process of establishing claims reserves is imprecise and reflects significant judgmental factors 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured claim and the settlement of the claim 
the actual emergence of claims and claim adjustment expenses may vary  perhaps materially  from the company s estimates thereof  because a estimates of liabilities are subject to large potential revisions  as the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the financial statement date  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred eg  jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes even after coverage is written and reserves are initially set that broaden liability and policy definitions and increase the severity of claims obligations  changes in the medical condition of claimants  public attitudes and social economic conditions such as inflation  b estimates of claims do not make provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of claims or types of claims not sufficiently represented in the company s historical data base or which are not yet quantifiable  and c estimates of future costs are subject to the inherent limitation on the ability to predict the aggregate results of future events 
in addition to the factors described above that are generally applicable to property and casualty insurers  our ability to estimate claims reserves accurately is subject to risks and uncertainties arising out of the recent history and growth of the company 
these factors are discussed in more detail in item a of this report  risk factors 
the following are particularly significant factors that limit our ability  as compared with a more mature insurer with a larger and more stable book of business  to estimate claims reserves accurately our growth strategy necessarily entails increased financial and operational risks and other challenges that are greater than and different from those to which we have previously been subject as the nature of our business has changed and grown 
generally  new business initially produces higher claim ratios than more seasoned in force business  and this factor is likely to be magnified to the extent that we enter multiple new states and market areas within a short period of time 
furthermore  it amplifies the importance of our ability to assess any new trends timely and accurately and respond effectively 
pricing decisions in new states and markets  involving different claims environments  distribution sources and customer demographics  must necessarily be made without the same level of experience and data that is available in existing markets 
our growth requires additional personnel resources  including management and technical underwriting  claims and servicing personnel  relationships with agents and vendors with whom we have not previously done business  and additional dependence on operating systems and technology 
as a result  we often do not have as much reliable historical information about costs and trends in claims as would an insurer with more experience in the markets in which we grown 

table of contents we may not have historical results for new markets  or the historic development of reserves for claim and claim adjustment expense may not accurately reflect future trends 
for example  these estimates are subject to new classes or types of losses not sufficiently represented in historical data or not discernible from the data available to us  and our inability to predict or recognize future events 
we have recently made significant operational changes in management of our claims administration to accelerate the recognition and resolution of claims 
these changes may result in an increase in the amount of aggregate claim settlements and cause our ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense to increase in comparison to prior periods 
in addition  changing claims trends increase the uncertainties which exist in the estimation process and could lead to inaccurate estimates of claim and claims adjustment expense 
ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves 
the company monitors reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques which are discussed below 
the company does not discount to present value that portion of its claims reserves expected to be paid in future periods 
the following table discloses the amount of the gross unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense for each year presented and separately identifies the amount of ibnr for each material line of business 
gross unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for the years ending december  amounts in thousands case personal auto run off incurred but not reported personal auto run off total reserves key assumptions the following discussion provides information regarding the most important assumptions we use in estimating claims reserves in the nonstandard personal automobile insurance business 
these assumptions were also important historically in estimating claims reserves in the runoff business but  as discussed below  the decline in the number of remaining runoff claims has made conventional actuarial methods less useful and has resulted in our basing such estimates primarily on case by case evaluations of individual claim files 

table of contents we rely on several key assumptions regarding the existence of consistency or a discernible trend in the following factors historical information used to prepare prior expected loss ratios the rate at which claims are settled or closed historical information regarding claims frequency the level of case reserve adequacy the actuarial staff monitors accident quarter data  seeking to identify whether these assumptions have remained consistent and  if deviations are identified  to adjust reserves to take them into account by making qualitative and quantitative modifications to reflect such deviations 
this process necessarily involves the exercise of judgment in assessing the impact of changes from the patterns indicated by the assumptions noted above 
the key assumptions identified above are in turn based on additional underlying assumptions regarding numerous internal and external factors  which often vary for different states  programs and coverage groups  for different accident periods and for different actuarial estimation methodologies 
internal factors include  but are not limited to  the experience level of our claims department personnel  changes in claims department processes  and changes in underwriting standards and rules 
external factors include  but are not limited to  claim severity  claim frequency  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services  legislative activities  regulatory changes  judicial changes  and litigation trends 
in analyzing claims data for the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that the underlying accident quarter data reflected variances from historical patterns and required further analysis 
based on that analysis  we made adjustments to account for these variances  as follows assumption change from prior periods and nature of adjustment historical information regarding claim frequency during the fourth quarter of  we analyzed the time from loss date that it took to record a claim in our system 
we noticed a significant reduction in the number of days from loss date to the date recorded  starting during late second quarter  with major acceleration occurring during the fourth quarter of  which we believe is the result of changes we have made in our claim practices 
this speed up in exposure recognition implies future development patterns will be different from historical patterns which are used to estimate ultimate liabilities 
we attempted to take this into consideration in our estimate of reserves through various adjustments to our loss development factors and utilizing actuarial judgment 

table of contents the rate at which claims are settled or closed during the fourth quarter of  we analyzed the time from report date to close date for all of our closed claims 
we noticed a significant reduction in the number of days our claims department was taking to close claims  starting during the third quarter of  which we believe is the result of changes we have made in our claim practices 
this speed up in claim closure rate implies future development patterns will be different from historical patterns which are used to estimate ultimate liabilities 
we attempted to take this into consideration in our estimate of reserves by utilizing a berquist sherman adjustment  adjusting selected loss development factors  and utilizing actuarial judgment 
historical information used to prepare a priori expected loss ratios  historical information regarding claims frequency  the level of case reserve adequacy during  we greatly expanded our writings  diversifying both into other states  and  within states  into different geographical areas 
we also expanded into various other driver classes  namely into the internationally licensed segment 
expanding into different geographical segments meant writing more business in jurisdictions with different judicial systems and negligence laws  including areas that may be more susceptible to insurance fraud 
these changes can affect development patterns  so that historical patterns may not be reflective of future patterns 
although no adjustments were recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of changes in these assumptions  they are closely monitored as we seek to identify any deviations from existing patterns 
all of the key assumptions referred to above since we experienced rapid growth during  the credibility associated with each accident quarter gradually increased over time 
changes in credibility over time affect development patterns in that past development patterns are less stable than future patterns based on more credible data 
however  the fact that the company has continued to enter new markets results in limits on credibility for the foreseeable future 
no adjustments were recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of these changes  but they are closely monitored as we seek to identify any deviations from existing patterns 
when we reviewed claims data to make estimates for the fourth quarter of  some of the same variances were found 
based on the analysis of these variances  we made the following adjustments assumption change from prior periods and nature of adjustment the rate at which claims are settled or closed the trend that had been identified in continued and accelerated in  and we made adjustments to take this into account 
we attempted to take the acceleration of claims settlement rates into consideration by utilizing a berquist sherman adjustment  selection of loss development factors and use of actuarial judgment 

table of contents historical information used to prepare a priori expected loss ratios  historical information regarding claims frequency during  we continued to expand our writings and to diversify further 
we also expanded into various other driver classes  namely into the internationally licensed segment 
expanding into different geographical segments meant writing more business in jurisdictions with different judicial systems and negligence laws  including areas that may be more susceptible to insurance fraud 
these changes can affect development patterns  so that historical patterns may not be reflective of future patterns 
we attempted to take these changes into consideration in our estimate of reserves by the selection of loss development factors and use of actuarial judgment 
case reserve adequacy during our review of data for the fourth quarter of  we noticed that the average case reserve per claimant in bodily injury coverages had increased for our texas loss experience 
we attempted to take the increase in case reserves into consideration by utilizing a berquist sherman adjustment  selection of loss development factors and use of actuarial judgment 
all of the key assumptions referred to above as the trend first observed in continued  the credibility associated with each accident quarter gradually increased over time 
changes in credibility over time affect development patterns in that past development patterns are less stable than future patterns based on more credible data 
however  the fact that the company has continued to enter new markets results in limits on credibility for the foreseeable future 
we attempted to take this into consideration in our estimates by selection of loss development factors and use of actuarial judgment 
the law of large numbers applies to selecting development patterns  ie the confidence of a point estimate is improved by increasing the amount of data used to develop the estimate  however  the data must be reasonably homogeneous  and exhibit little variation over time 
changes associated with the assumptions listed above affect the homogeneity of our data  and the variance associated with the loss development factors derived from the data 
this implies that the variance around our point estimate has increased over time  or that the confidence interval around our point estimate has widened over time 
this in turn implies there is greater volatility associated with our point estimate and we attempted to take this uncertainty into consideration with our estimates for the fourth quarter of and for methodologies we utilize somewhat different processes for the estimation of reserves in the runoff line and in the nonstandard personal automobile business 
we consider our commercial runoff business which consists primarily of commercial auto and general liability coverages to be long tailed 
for most of this business  we use the same methods employed for our personal lines business  namely the paid loss method and the incurred loss method  as well as other methods not utilized for personal lines 
for our specialty and umbrella lines  for which we have fewer years of experience  we use an expected loss ratio method and test the results with a bornheutter ferguson method 
for our runoff lines  however  the remaining number of claims has declined to the point that these conventional actuarial methods are of less utility than during the period in which the number of active claims provided more complete statistical data 
accordingly  in recent reporting periods the aggregate case and ibnr reserve estimates for runoff claims have been based primarily on evaluations of individual claim files 
this methodology is not used for our personal lines business 

table of contents in both personal lines and commercial runoff business  we utilize the same procedures for estimating reserves on a quarterly basis as we do annually 
historically  the independent actuarial consulting firm that we retain had the responsibility for making the reserve estimate used in our financial statements 
however  we changed our procedures beginning with the financial statements for the third quarter of and subsequent quarterly and annual periods 
in our revised procedures  the reserve estimates are made for each period by our in house actuarial staff  and we do not rely upon the review by the independent actuarial firm to estimate the amount of our gaap reserves 
however  the analysis provided by the independent actuarial firm is used to corroborate the reserve selections made by the in house actuarial staff  and that firm also provides additional analysis as requested 
our independent actuarial consulting firm has also provided annual opinions related to adequacy of the statutory reserves for the insurance company subsidiary 
the actuarial procedures we follow are described in detail below 
the reserve estimates are developed based on review and analysis of accident quarter data 
once the reserve levels have been estimated  management makes appropriate entries 
these estimates were set forth in a detailed presentation to the audit committee of the board of directors  together with underlying statistical information on which the estimates are based 
the audit committee met each quarter with management and a representative of the independent actuarial consulting firm and engaged in a detailed discussion regarding the reserve selections and underlying statistical data 
specific methodologies runoff lines within runoff commercial business  the different lines of business each have somewhat different development characteristics  which we take into account in making reserve estimates  as follows commercial auto most states in which we wrote policies have two year statutes of limitation 
because we ceased writing new business in  no new claims are expected to be incurred 
general liability generally  new claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
however  we continue to receive new claims for alleged construction defects  even though we have included an exclusion for such liability in general liability policies since we respond to any claims that are asserted 
specialty lines all policies we wrote are on a claims made basis  so we do not expect any additional claims 
personal umbrella because coverage is related to the resolution of claims in underlying insurance policies  development tends to occur over a relatively long time period 
we do not expect additional claims 
however  as noted above  in recent reporting periods the estimates for all runoff claims have been based primarily on case by case evaluations of individual claim files as the number of claims has fallen to the point that conventional actuarial methods have become less useful 

table of contents specific methodologies nonstandard personal automobile insurance for private passenger auto business  all coverages are considered short tailed  as we primarily write minimum limits business primarily six month policies  and approximately two thirds of our ultimate liabilities are realized within months 
for this business  we analyze development patterns separately by state for each state in which we write business  and within each state  by each separate line of coverage we offer in that particular state 
we further analyze patterns for each accident quarter to ascertain whether development patterns are changing over time 
analyzing our data in this way allows us to group data in homogeneous sets  while maximizing the degree of credibility for each data set where limited data are available 
for states and or coverages where the data are limited  we also consider development patterns from other markets in which we write business that have more credible amounts of data and which have similar policy limits 
we employ various statistical processes to estimate our unpaid claims and cae 
our actuarial staff performs quarterly analyses on multiple unique  homogenous data subsets to produce estimates of the aggregate unpaid claims and cae 
we analyze the data separately for each of the states in which we write business  for each type of coverage group written  and by accident quarter 
we apply the actuarial methodologies outlined below with respect to each of these data subsets to establish separate point estimates for ibnr claims 
we then aggregate all of the separate point estimates to develop our best estimate of our overall unpaid claims and cae 
development patterns in the personal auto business are somewhat unique by state  since each state has varying policy limits  laws establishing liability  and litigation environments 
development patterns also vary by line of coverage  as liability claims traditionally take longer to settle than physical damage claims 
finally  development patterns can vary by accident quarter as changes have occurred and are expected to continue within our claims department 
we believe that these changes resulted in an acceleration of exposure recognition and in ultimate claim settlement 
our expansion into different geographical areas within each state has caused our mix of business to change  and the credibility associated with data for each accident quarter has changed over time 
as a result  our development patterns exhibit a greater variance than the development patterns for a stable  larger and more mature book of business  and we recognize this volatility in our analysis of the data 
for private passenger auto business  incurred but not reported reserves include provisions in the aggregate for the following claims that have occurred  but have not been reported to us 
claims that have been reported to us  but have not been recorded on our system  and a case reserve has not been established yet 
claims that are closed  but may be re opened for payment additional payments at a future date 
claims that are known and recorded in our system  but may have development beyond the case reserve established when the claim was first reported 

table of contents we compute unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense excluding claims department expense ibnr for the above four provisions on a combined basis  by first estimating ultimate claims and claim adjustment expense cae amounts for each accident quarter  and then subtracting from these amounts the cumulative paid and case reserves on known claims for each accident quarter 
there are several methods we utilize to estimate ultimate loss and lae amounts paid loss development method incurred loss development method bornheutter ferguson paid method bornheutter ferguson incurred method in addition  ultimate claim counts are estimated using closed and reported claim count data 
ultimate claims and cae estimates are divided by ultimate claim count estimates to determine an ultimate claim severity  which provides a reasonability check for our ultimate loss and alae amounts 
if severities are in line with expectations  we have an additional degree of confidence in our estimates 
the methods listed above assume that the influences that affect the development patterns for each accident quarter will remain constant over time 
because of this  selection of development patterns that will apply to current open claims and claims incurred but not reported must consider several factors 
these include  but are not limited to  the impact of inflation on claim costs and changes in the rate of inflation  the rate and level at which our claims adjusters make payments and settle claims and any changes in this rate or level  changes in the adequacy or method used to establish case reserves  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in judicial decisions  legislation changes  and other factors 
changes in any of these factors imply that development patterns are not remaining constant over time one key assumption in the methods used to estimate ultimate liability 
when the rate at which adjusters make payments and settle claims has accelerated over time  ultimate loss estimates developed using the methods employed above may overstate true projected ultimate liabilities  thus adjustments that take these changes in to consideration are utilized 
various methods are used to adjust for these changes including  but not limited to  adjustments that take into consideration changes in exposure recognition  the rate of claims closure and changes in case reserve adequacy as well as tail factor analysis and actuarial judgment 
unpaid claims department expenses are estimated using a cost per claim approach 
under this approach historical paid claims department expense data are divided by the historical number of claim activity transactions 
it is assumed that the expense associated with settling a liability claim is twice that of settling a physical damage claim  since liability claims are typically more complex 
it is also assumed that there are two activities creating expenses associated with pure ibnr claims the cost to open the claim and the cost to settle and close the claim  while only one activity is associated with claims already open the cost to settle and close the claim 
the cost per activity is multiplied by the total estimated future activities to arrive at an estimate of future claims department expense for all claims that have occurred prior to the evaluation date 
variability of claims reserves traditionally  use of multiple methodologies produces a cluster of estimates with modest dispersion in the indicated possible outcomes 
however  due to the changes the company has experienced as outlined above  use of the methodologies cited above produced conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes 
such bands do not necessarily constitute a range of outcomes  nor do we calculate a range of outcomes 
if there is a significant variation in the results generated by different actuarial methodologies  our actuarial staff further analyzes the data using additional techniques 
these processes may include making adjustments to the key assumptions underlying the methodologies  using additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies  and applying actuarial judgment 

table of contents in arriving at each individual point estimate of reserves for ibnr claims and cae in each separate data subset  our actuarial staff considers the likely predictive value of the various methodologies employed in light of internal and external variables that may impact the reserves 
for each data subset in each accident quarter  the point estimate selected is not necessarily one of the points produced by any particular methodology utilized  but may be another point that takes into consideration each of the points produced by the several loss methodologies used and is based on actuarial judgment 
for example  the current accident quarter may not have enough paid claims data to rely upon  leading our actuarial staff to conclude that an incurred development methodology provides a better estimate than a paid development methodology 
in such a case  more weight would be given to an incurred methodology for that particular accident quarter 
as noted above in the discussion of the methodologies we use in setting reserves for our runoff business  the decline in the number of outstanding claims has made traditional actuarial techniques less useful in determining our estimated liabilities  and the estimates for runoff claims have been based primarily on case by case evaluations by the claims department of developments in individual claim files 
accordingly  we generally do not depend on assumptions about historical claims development in making these estimates  and it would not be feasible to devise any means of testing the sensitivity of our estimates 
in determining our reserve estimates for nonstandard personal automobile insurance  for each financial reporting date we record our best estimate  which is a point estimate  of our overall unpaid claims and cae for both current and prior accident years 
because the underlying processes require the use of estimates and professional actuarial judgment  establishing claims reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
as our experience develops and we learn new information  our quarterly reserving process may produce revisions to our previously reported claims reserves  which we refer to as development  and such changes may be material 
we recognize favorable development when we decrease our previous estimate of ultimate losses  which results in an increase in net income in the period recognized 
we recognize unfavorable development when we increase our previous estimate of ultimate losses  which results in a decrease in net income in the period recognized 
accordingly  while we record our best estimate  our claims reserves are subject to potential variability 
we believe it is reasonably likely that our loss costs could increase or decrease by from current estimates  as remaining claims are recorded and resolved 
loss costs reflect the incurred loss per unit of exposure and are the product of frequency and severity 
a increase or decrease in our loss costs would result in unfavorable or favorable development of million assuming the size of the company remains constant 
this estimate of sensitivity is informational only  is not a projection of future results and does not take into account possible effects of extraordinary litigation events such as class action claims 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred income tax items are accounted for under the asset and liability method which provides for temporary differences between the reporting of earnings for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes  primarily deferred policy acquisition costs  the discount on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  net operating loss carry forwards and the nondeductible portion of the change in unearned premiums 
the company considers available evidence  both objective and subjective  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  management s analysis of available evidence  both objective and subjective  concluded it was more likely than not that additional portions of this asset would be used in future periods so the valuation allowance was reduced by million  producing a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of the company required both sufficient capital to support its expanded operations and cover fixed costs and evidence that business written could achieve margins comparable to those found in other property and casualty insurers before it was appropriate to begin reducing the valuation allowance relating to net operating loss carryforwards 
until the fourth quarter of  such evidence was not available 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  the company increased the amount of the valuation allowance by  resulting in an allowance on the gross deferred tax asset of  in making this determination  the company considered all available evidence  including the fact that the company incurred a taxable loss in and had incurred  as of december   a cumulative taxable loss for the three years then ended  which was not the case as of september  the company increased the amount of the valuation allowance by  in previous quarters of as of december  and  the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance was  and  and the valuation allowance was  and  respectively
