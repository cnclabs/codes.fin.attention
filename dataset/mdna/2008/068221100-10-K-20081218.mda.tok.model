item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the consolidated balance sheets of barnwell industries  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as barnwell  we  our  us or the company as of september  and  and the related consolidated statements of earnings  stockholders equity and comprehensive income  and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of barnwell to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates management believes the accounting policies that are most critical in assisting financial statement readers in understanding and evaluating our results due to their subjective judgments are those related to the full cost ceiling calculation and depletion of our oil and natural gas properties  income taxes and asset retirement obligation 
we continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations 
oil and natural gas properties full cost ceiling calculation and depletion policy description we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties  under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling limitation is the sum of the discounted present value at  using prices as of the end of each reporting period on a constant basis  of barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance sheet  plus the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion  less related income tax effects 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is expensed unless subsequent market price changes eliminate or reduce the indicated write down in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin topic d 
judgments and assumptions the estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  historical data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
our reserve estimates are prepared annually by independent petroleum engineers and quarterly by internal personnel 
the passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the past three fiscal years  annual revisions to our reserve volume estimates have averaged of the previous year s estimate 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  such revisions could result in a write down of oil and natural gas properties 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by at the end of fiscal  the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately  this decrease would not have resulted in a write down in fiscal in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling  estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense 
the lower the estimated reserves  the higher the depletion rate per unit of production 
conversely  the higher the estimated reserves  the lower the depletion rate per unit of production 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by as of the beginning of fiscal  depletion for fiscal would have increased by approximately  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that a discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely which results in a value that is not necessarily indicative of the fair market value of the reserves 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
rather  they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each period for which the ceiling calculation is performed 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
therefore  oil and natural gas property write downs that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in prices as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
income taxes policy description income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
judgments and assumptions we make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period 
significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods 
we are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is provided 
changes in the assumptions regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could result in an increase or decrease in our income tax provision 
furthermore  changes in our business performance could require a valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods 
the impact of any of these changes could be material 
historically  our current income tax estimates have not materially differed from our income tax returns filed with taxing authorities 
however  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
barnwell has established a valuation allowance primarily for the us tax effect of deferred canadian taxes  accrued liabilities  bad debt allowances and state of hawaii net operating loss carryforwards which may not be realizable in future years as there can be no assurance of any specific level of earnings  that the timing of us taxable income will coincide with the payment of canadian taxes to enable canadian taxes to be fully deducted or recoverable for us tax purposes  or that canadian deferred tax assets will provide any incremental benefit for us tax purposes over the amount of benefit for canadian tax purposes 
canadian deferred tax assets related to liabilities accrued for book purposes but not for tax purposes are estimated to be realized through future canadian income tax deductions against future canadian oil and natural gas earnings 
us deferred tax assets related to liabilities accrued for book purposes but not for tax purposes and the excess of the cost basis of investment in land and residential real estate for tax purposes over the cost basis of investment in land and residential real estate for book purposes are estimated to be realized from deductions against future us earnings from sales of interests in leasehold land  land development rights and residential real estate 
foreign tax credit carryforwards are estimated to be utilized when us federal income taxes otherwise due on canadian source income in a given year exceed the foreign tax credit generated in that year 
barnwell has incurred higher us tax liabilities on canadian source earnings than canadian tax liabilities on such earnings in recent years 
as such  barnwell has utilized its foreign tax credit carryforwards in recent years and barnwell estimates that it will fully utilize its remaining foreign tax credit carryforward 
the amount of deferred income tax assets considered realizable may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
in addition  barnwell operates within the us and canada and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
barnwell records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities in the evaluation required pursuant to fasb interpretation fin no 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
management believes that barnwell s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect barnwell s current and deferred income tax amounts 
asset retirement obligation policy description barnwell accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related reserves 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating expense 
if an obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  barnwell will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
judgments and assumptions the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred along with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
barnwell has estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash outflows required to settle abandonment and restoration liabilities 
the present value calculation includes numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities  the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability  what constitutes adequate restoration  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and consideration of changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
abandonment and restoration cost estimates are determined in conjunction with barnwell s reserve engineers based on historical information regarding costs incurred to abandon and restore similar well sites  information regarding current market conditions and costs  and knowledge of subject well sites and properties 
the process of estimating the asset retirement obligation requires substantial judgment and use of estimates  resulting in imprecise determinations 
following the implementation of sfas no 
 actual asset retirement obligations through the end of fiscal have not materially differed from our estimates 
however  because of the inherent imprecision of estimates as described above  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
a increase in accretion and depletion related to the asset retirement obligation would have increased barnwell s fiscal expenses before taxes by approximately contractual obligations disclosure is not required as barnwell qualifies as a smaller reporting company 
overview barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business exploring for  developing  producing and selling oil and natural gas in canada oil and natural gas segment  investing in leasehold land and other real estate interests in hawaii land investment segment  acquiring property for investment and development of homes for sale in hawaii residential real estate segment  established january  and drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in hawaii contract drilling segment 
oil and natural gas segment barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short term contracts with marketers of oil 
natural gas sold by barnwell is generally sold under both long term and short term contracts with prices indexed to market prices 
the price of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers 
oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control 
market prices for petroleum products are dependent upon factors such as  but not limited to  changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  changes in weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  and output 
petroleum and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly 
natural gas prices tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand  although this trend has become less pronounced due to the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning in the summer and increased natural gas storage capacity in north america 
oil and natural gas exploration  development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices  thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploration  development and operation of oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well 
barnwell s oil and natural gas operations make capital expenditures in the exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas 
cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary  however  a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves 
due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development  significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort 
land investment segment barnwell owns a controlling interest in kaupulehu developments  a hawaii general partnership which owns interests in leasehold land and development rights for property located approximately six miles north of the kona international airport in the north kona district of the island of hawaii  within and adjacent to hualalai resort at historic ka upulehu  between the queen kaahumanu highway and the pacific ocean 
a director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures and his affiliated entities own a direct financial interest in of kaupulehu developments 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
kaupulehu developments interests are discussed below 
kaupulehu developments interests include the following development rights for residentially zoned leasehold land within and adjacent to the hualalai golf club which are under option to a developer 
as of september   the development rights are under option for  comprised of the balance of  due on december  and two payments of  due on december  and december  the right to receive varying percentages of the gross sales from the sale of lots within approximately acres in the kaupulehu area by another developer 
approximately  acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation in the kaupulehu area located adjacent to the acres described above 
kaupulehu developments has an agreement which provides a potential developer with the exclusive right to negotiate with kaupulehu developments with respect to these  acres 
this right expires in june or  if the developer completes any and all environmental assessments and surveys reasonably required to support a petition to the hawaii state land use commission for reclassification and rezoning of the aforementioned land  in june kaupulehu mauka investors  llc  a limited liability company wholly owned by barnwell  holds lot acquisition rights as to lots within approximately  acres of agricultural zoned leasehold land in the upland area of kaupulehu mauka lands situated between the queen kaahumanu highway and the mamalahoa highway at kaupulehu  north kona  island and state of hawaii 
the lot acquisition rights give barnwell the right to acquire residential lots  each of which is currently estimated to be two to five acres in size  which may be developed on the mauka lands 
these lands are currently classified as agricultural by the state of hawaii and  accordingly  the developer of these lands will need to pursue both state and county of hawaii approvals for reclassification and rezoning to permit a residential subdivision and negotiate development terms 
residential real estate segment barnwell owns an controlling interest in kaupulehu  lllp kaupulehu  a hawaii limited liability limited partnership  which acquires house lots for investment and constructs turnkey single family homes for future sale 
a director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures and his affiliates have a interest in kaupulehu refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion on related party interests 
contract drilling segment barnwell drills water  water monitoring and geothermal wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in hawaii 
contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity  dollar value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and can fluctuate significantly 
business environment our primary operations are concentrated in the state of hawaii and in canada 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by macro economic conditions in those areas  as well as general economic conditions of the us domestic and world economies 
recent uncertainty arising from the global credit crisis  steep declines in the stock market  collapses of financial institutions and subsequent government bail outs are evidence that the us and global economies are weakening 
oil and natural gas segment historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile  are difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly 
oil and natural gas prices hit historic high levels in recent years and during the latter half of fiscal since then prices have fallen sharply from the recent record levels and may continue to decline 
natural gas prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages during the three years ended september   have ranged from a low of per thousand cubic feet to a high of per thousand cubic feet 
during the quarter ended june   the quarterly average price for natural gas was per thousand cubic feet 
this average price was the highest since the quarter ended december  when prices had been affected by the effects of hurricane katrina  which interrupted oil production in the gulf area resulting in a significant effect on fuel prices 
oil prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages for the period discussed above  ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel the average price for the quarter ended june  beginning in the quarter ended september  through the date of this filing  oil and natural gas prices have experienced a significant decline 
if prices continue to decline  we may be required to write off any excess of unamortized capitalized costs over the related cost ceiling and reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures  possibly to a significant degree 
land investment and residential real estate segments according to the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism s dbedt th quarter quarterly statistical economic report  virtually no growth is projected in hawaii s economy for fiscal factors contributing to the slowing of hawaii s economy include falling tourism and falling residential investment 
tightening credit markets  increased unemployment rates and reduced visitor counts suggest a slowing economy 
for the past few years  hawaii s economy has experienced positive growth and the south kohala north kona area of the island of hawaii  the area in which kaupulehu developments leasehold interests are located and kaupulehu is building homes  has experienced strong demand for residential real estate 
however beginning in fiscal  the weakened economy coupled with the softening real estate markets caused sales within the kaupulehu area to be lower than original expectations 
due to the softening of the real estate market  future revenues from real estate sales will likely be lower than in recent years 
if future market demand for luxury real estate is less than current expectations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 
barnwell anticipates the two turnkey homes currently under construction will be completed within the next six months 
our ability to sell the completed residences and or lots held for investment is contingent upon the strength of the real estate market 
however  due to the softening of the real estate market  the demand for luxury homes is anticipated to decrease in the near future 
contract drilling segment demand for water well drilling and or pump installation services is volatile and dependent upon land development activities within the state of hawaii 
according to the dbedt th quarter quarterly statistical economic report  the dollar value of private building authorizations and government contracts awarded decreased during as compared to furthermore during the quarter ended september   for the first time since early  construction jobs showed a decline from the previous year s comparable quarter 
major indicators of construction activity suggest slower construction activity into results of operations summary barnwell generated net earnings of  in fiscal  an  increase from net earnings of  in fiscal this increase was largely due to the following items operating profits before income taxes increased  primarily due to higher prices received for all petroleum products  partially offset by a  increase  before income taxes  in general and administrative expenses net of minority interest  and bad debt expense of  before income taxes  principally related to oil and natural gas segment receivables  and the current year period included a deferred income tax benefit of  as a result of a decrease in canadian federal income tax rates as compared to a benefit of  in the prior year period 
barnwell generated net earnings of  in fiscal  an  decrease from net earnings of  in fiscal net earnings for fiscal decreased as net earnings of fiscal included the receipt of a closing payment from the sale of increment ii of kaupulehu developments leasehold land interests  which generated a  operating profit  after minority interest and before taxes  and proceeds from real estate consulting services rendered 
there was no closing payment or real estate consulting proceeds received in fiscal also contributing to the decrease was the recognition of  of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards and  of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction of canadian income tax rates during fiscal there was no reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in fiscal the decrease was further attributable to lower prices received by barnwell for natural gas and natural gas liquids in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in net earnings was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses in fiscal due primarily to reduced bonus expense and a decrease in costs associated with regulatory compliance efforts 
general in addition to us operations  barnwell conducts foreign operations in canada 
consequently  barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar decreased at september   as compared to september  accordingly  the assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and revenues and expenses of barnwell s subsidiaries operating in canada have been adjusted to reflect the change in the exchange rates 
barnwell s canadian dollar assets are greater than its canadian dollar liabilities  therefore  increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar generate other comprehensive income or losses  respectively 
the fiscal year average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased at september   as compared to september  other comprehensive income and losses are not included in net earnings 
the other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  for fiscal was  a  decrease from other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  of  in fiscal foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal  and and are reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the impact of fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar may be material from period to period 
barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between the canadian and us dollars 
oil and natural gas revenues selected operating statistics the following tables set forth barnwell s annual net production and annual average price per unit of production for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and fiscal as compared to fiscal production amounts reported are net of royalties and the alberta royalty tax credit  where applicable 
as discussed in further detail below  the alberta royalty tax credit was discontinued effective january  fiscal fiscal annual net production increase decrease units natural gas mcf oil bbls liquids bbls annual average price per unit increase natural gas mcf oil bbls liquids bbls fiscal fiscal annual net production increase decrease units natural gas mcf oil bbls liquids bbls annual average price per unit increase decrease natural gas mcf oil bbls liquids bbls mcf  cubic feet 
natural gas price per unit is net of pipeline charges 
bbl s stock tank barrel equivalent to us gallons oil and natural gas revenues increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to significant increases in oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  which increased  and  respectively  as compared to prices in fiscal net natural gas production decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to natural declines in production from both older and newer properties 
at dunvegan  barnwell s principal oil and natural gas property  net natural gas production at dunvegan decreased  mcf 
net oil production increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to production from new oil wells 
the increase was partially offset by natural declines in production from older properties 
oil and natural gas prices have experienced a decline in october and november  thus barnwell estimates that oil and natural gas revenues for the first quarter of fiscal will be negatively impacted as compared to the same period in fiscal however  oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control  have been historically volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and natural gas prices 
the alberta royalty tax credit artc program was discontinued by the alberta government  effective january  accordingly  no artc credits were received during fiscal barnwell received  and  under the artc program in fiscal years and  respectively 
credits received by barnwell under the artc program through december  were recorded as a credit against oil and natural gas royalties and reported in oil and natural gas revenues 
oil and natural gas revenues decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due primarily to decreases in prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids 
oil prices in fiscal were essentially equivalent to oil prices in fiscal net natural gas production in fiscal was essentially unchanged from that of fiscal gross natural gas production decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to natural declines in production from older properties and declines at certain newer properties due to various operational issues 
the impact of the decreases in gross production was largely offset by lower royalties as a percentage of revenues  due in part to lower prices  which reduced the royalty owners share of gas production 
at dunvegan  barnwell s principal oil and natural gas property  gross natural gas production decreased  mcf due to natural declines from older wells  whereas net natural gas production at dunvegan increased  mcf due to a decrease in royalties as a percentage of revenues  due in part to lower prices 
oil and natural gas operating expenses operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal oil and natural gas operating expenses increased due to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase  however  was partially offset by lower workover activity and repairs at certain older properties 
operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal operating expenses increased due to higher utility costs  industry wide cost pressures which resulted in higher oilfield services costs  and higher than usual workover activity which resulted in higher repairs and maintenance costs 
the increase was also due to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses  in fiscal as compared to fiscal sale of development rights  sale of interest in leasehold land  and minority interest in earnings kaupulehu developments holds development rights for residentially zoned leasehold land within and adjacent to the hualalai golf club 
the development rights are under option to hualalai investors  an entity in which barnwell acquired a passive minority interest through an owned joint venture in fiscal hualalai investors is the owner and current developer of hualalai resort 
revenues  minority interest in earnings and operating profit related to sales of development rights under option for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows year ended september  sale of development rights under option proceeds fees revenues sale of development rights  net minority interest in earnings operating profit sale of development rights  net fiscal proceeds from the sale of development rights of  include  of proceeds received for the development rights option that was due on december  as well as  of proceeds related to the development rights option due on december  the total amount of remaining future option receipts  if all options are fully exercised  is  as of september   comprised of  representing the balance of the option due on december   and two payments of  due on december  and december  if any annual option payment is not made  the then remaining development right options will expire 
there is no assurance that any portion of the remaining options will be exercised 
all capitalized costs associated with kaupulehu developments development rights were expensed in previous years 
the development rights option revenues  net of related fees  are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings as sale of development rights  net

wb is not affiliated with barnwell  kaupulehu developments or kaupulehu percentage of sales revenues resulting from kaupulehu s lot purchases were previously not eliminated 
in the three months ended september   barnwell concluded that its share of all such revenues should be eliminated  resulting in a  non cash reduction in revenues reported as sale of interest in leasehold land  net in the consolidated statements of earnings  with corresponding  and  reductions in the carrying value of residential lots under development and investment in residential parcels  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet at september  impacts on all periods affected were not material 
in june  kaupulehu developments entered into an agreement with wb and wb kd acquisition ii  llc wbkd  under which kaupulehu developments sold its interest in increment ii to wbkd increment ii agreement 
increment ii represents a portion of approximately acres of leasehold land zoned for single family and multi family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse in the kaupulehu area 
there is no affiliation between kaupulehu developments and wb or wbkd 
wb and wbkd are both affiliates of rp hualalai investors  llc and westbrook partners 
pursuant to the increment ii agreement  kaupulehu developments received a  closing payment and is entitled to receive future payments from wbkd based on a percentage of the sales prices of the residential lots  ranging from to  to be determined in the future depending upon a number of variables  including whether the lots are sold prior to improvement 
no increment ii payments were received in fiscal or fiscal revenues from percentage of sales payments and the increment ii closing payment  net of related costs  are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended september   and  respectively  as sale of interest in leasehold land  net 
there is no assurance that any future payments will be received

contract drilling contract drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump installation  replacement and repair in hawaii 
contract drilling revenues increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the contract drilling segment generated a  operating profit before general and administrative expenses during fiscal  an increase of  as compared to an operating profit before general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to increases in well drilling and pump installation activity  higher values and margins of contracts performed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and lower well drilling operating profit in fiscal due to higher drilling costs incurred on contracts performed 
at september   there was a backlog of six well drilling contracts and five pump installation and repair contracts  of which four well drilling and three pump installation and repair were in progress as of september  the backlog of contract drilling revenues as of november  was approximately  all of the contracts in backlog at november  are expected to be completed within fiscal year contract drilling revenues increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal operating profit before general and administrative expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to higher drilling costs incurred on certain contracts 
contract drilling revenues and costs are not seasonal in nature but can fluctuate significantly based on the awarding and timing of contracts  which are determined by contract drilling customer demand 
gas processing and other income gas processing and other income increased  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase is primarily due to current year gains of  from the sale of lot purchase rights see further discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item and  representing insurance proceeds received on the involuntary conversion of an incapacitated drill rig that had been fully depreciated 
gas processing and other income was relatively unchanged increased  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal gain on sale of drill rig barnwell sold a drill rig in fiscal for  net of costs associated with the sale  and recognized a pre tax gain of  there was no such sale in fiscal years or the drill rig was identical to one of barnwell s other drill rigs and was originally purchased to drill geothermal wells 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to i a  increase in current compensation costs  ii a  increase in professional services  primarily due to regulatory compliance efforts  and iii a  increase due to increases in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was principally attributable to i decreased personnel costs of  largely due to decreased bonus expense and incentive compensation costs  ii decreased professional services costs of  primarily related to regulatory compliance costs incurred in fiscal  and iii increased administrative expense reimbursements from oil and natural gas joint venture partners of  this decrease was partially offset by general inflationary increases 
bad debt expense during fiscal  barnwell recorded a  bad debt reserve principally due to the bankruptcy of semgroup  lp in july  semgroup  lp announced it had filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code as well as an application for creditor protection under the companies creditors arrangement act in canada 
a subsidiary of semgroup  lp was a significant marketer of barnwell s oil and natural gas 
as a result of the semgroup  lp bankruptcy filings  barnwell recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense during the year ended september  for production sold to the semgroup  lp subsidiary in june and july august and subsequent production was moved to a different marketer 
no bad debt reserves were recorded during fiscal or depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a increase in the depletion rate and a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in production 
the higher depletion rate is due to increases in barnwell s costs of finding and developing proven reserves 
barnwell s cost of finding and developing proven reserves has increased due to the costs of oil and natural gas exploration and development having increased along with product prices and the drilling of unsuccessful wells 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a increase in the depletion rate and a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
interest expense interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to higher average loan balances  partially offset by lower average interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal on barnwell s borrowings from royal bank of canada decreased to  as compared to in fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings under the real estate credit facility increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal from borrowings on the real estate credit facility decreased to  as compared to in fiscal of the interest amounts incurred   was capitalized in fiscal as compared to  during fiscal interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to higher average loan balances and  to a lesser degree  higher average interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal the average interest rate incurred during fiscal on barnwell s borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  as compared to in fiscal the weighted average balance of outstanding borrowings from royal bank of canada increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was also due in part to interest on borrowings under a  credit facility obtained during the latter half of fiscal on which barnwell incurred interest at an average rate of   of which was capitalized  barnwell did not have such a loan during fiscal interest costs for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows year ended september  interest costs incurred less interest costs capitalized on residential lots under development interest expense the majority of barnwell s debt is denominated in us dollars 
therefore  the increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar had a minimal impact on interest expense 
barnwell anticipates the two turnkey homes currently being built will be completed within the next six months 
upon such completion  barnwell will no longer capitalize interest incurred on borrowings pertaining to the two lots under development and construction costs 
additionally  barnwell estimates that  due to the current credit crisis  the interest rates on the company s facility with the royal bank of canada will increase upon renewal in april therefore  we anticipate interest expense starting in the third quarter of fiscal will increase accordingly 
income taxes during the first quarter of fiscal  the canadian government enacted reductions in the corporate tax rate from    and in calendar years    and  respectively  to    and  respectively 
this reduction in canadian federal tax rates resulted in a  reduction of the net deferred tax liability during fiscal a minor reduction in canadian federal tax rates in fiscal resulted in a  reduction in net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal barnwell s effective consolidated income tax rate for the year ended september   excluding the aforementioned  impact of the reduction in canadian income tax rates  was approximately  and the effective consolidated income tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately 
as barnwell establishes a valuation allowance for the us tax effect of deferred canadian taxes which may not be realizable in future years as there can be no assurance of any specific level of earnings or that the timing of us taxable income will coincide with the payment of canadian taxes to enable canadian taxes to be fully deducted or recoverable for us tax purposes  a relative increase in canadian deferred income taxes increases barnwell s consolidated effective income tax rate  and a relative decrease in such taxes decreases barnwell s consolidated effective income tax rate 
in fiscal  canadian deferred taxes  before the impact of the canadian income tax rate reduction discussed above  decreased 
in fiscal  canadian deferred taxes increased 
accordingly  the effective tax rate in fiscal  before the impact of the canadian income tax rate reduction  decreased in fiscal relative to fiscal partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was an increase due to the impact of a  canadian income tax provision for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  in fiscal included in the provision for income taxes for fiscal is a canadian deferred tax benefit of  resulting from reductions in canadian tax rates 
also included in the provision for income taxes for fiscal is the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of  due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards 
there were no reductions in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in fiscal or the effective tax rate  before the impact of the canadian tax rate reductions and benefit from the reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards  was approximately in fiscal due to a relatively high amount of canadian deferred taxes in that year that did not provide a corresponding benefit for us tax purposes 
equity in earnings of real estate affiliate in fiscal  barnwell entered into an agreement with nearco  inc nearco  to form mauka k  llc mauka k  for the purpose of providing real estate consulting services and investing in real estate 
barnwell and nearco each have a voting interest in mauka k 
nearco is a company controlled by a director of barnwell and minority interest owner in certain of barnwell s business ventures see further discussion on related party interests in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
barnwell does not have a controlling interest in mauka k and thus accounts for its investment utilizing the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  barnwell s proportionate share of its affiliate s income is included in equity in earnings of real estate affiliate 
in fiscal barnwell received net proceeds of  representing its share of real estate consulting revenues  less related expenses 
the net proceeds are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended september  as equity in earnings of real estate affiliate  net of tax 
there was essentially no activity in mauka k during fiscal years and environmental matters federal  state  and canadian governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply  particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of barnwell and could have a material adverse effect upon the earnings or competitive position of barnwell 
although barnwell s experience has been to the contrary  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case 
inflation the effect of inflation on barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations  interest cost as a substantial portion of barnwell s debt is at variable short term rates of interest which tend to increase as inflation increases  general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas prices realized by barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western canadian midwestern us prices for natural gas

liquidity and capital resources cash flows  debt and available credit cash flows provided by operations totaled  for fiscal  an increase of  as compared to  of cash flows provided by operations for the same period in the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in operating profit generated by barnwell s oil and natural gas segment 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal cash outflows for investing activities decreased primarily due to investments made in fiscal that were not made in fiscal these investments include a passive minority interest in three joint ventures  lot acquisition rights  a residential parcel held for investment  and deposits to acquire residential parcels 
the decrease in cash outflows from investing activities was partially offset by increased capital expenditure payments  primarily associated with barnwell s oil and natural gas segment  during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  barnwell acquired a residential lot for investment   of which was directly financed by a bank and thus is reflected as a non cash investing activity 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled  for fiscal as compared to  of cash flows provided by financing activities for fiscal this increase in cash outflows was primarily due to increases in long term debt repayments and barnwell stock repurchases in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  financing activities in the prior year included a greater amount of proceeds from long term debt borrowings and larger capital contributions received from a minority interest partner as compared to fiscal cash outflows from financing activities were partially offset by decreased dividend payments made during the current year as compared to the prior year

barnwell believes its current cash balances  future cash flows from operations  land investment segment proceeds from the sale of development rights and percentage of sales payments  and available credit will be sufficient to fund its estimated capital expenditures and operations for the next months  fund scheduled debt repayments and interest  and settle incentive compensation liabilities in cash if necessary 
however  oil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segment percentage of sales proceeds are unpredictable  sporadic  and not under barnwell s control 
development rights proceeds  on the other hand  are scheduled but there is no assurance that future monies will be received 
if estimated cash inflows do not occur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations  and or if barnwell s canadian revolving credit facility is reduced below the current level of borrowings under the facility after the april review or is reduced because of significant decreases in the currency exchange rate  or if the real estate revolving credit facility s loan advance limitation is reduced below borrowed amounts as a result of a decrease in appraised values of the underlying security  barnwell may be required to reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures and other expenditures  possibly significantly  and seek alternative sources of financing or liquidate investments and or operating assets to make any required cash outflows 
barnwell anticipates the two turnkey homes currently being built will be completed within the next six months 
the real estate revolving credit facility pertaining to the two turnkey homes and two lots held for investment is due on december  if barnwell is unable to sell the homes and lots held for investment within a reasonable timeframe  barnwell will be required to refinance the loan or seek alternative financing  or barnwell may be required to reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures to make any required cash outflows
