per share on the company s common stock for an indicative dividend for the full year of of per share  subject to the normal quarterly review by the board 
business environment the company conducts its business primarily within the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry  which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations 
many competitive factors may significantly affect the company s sales of its products  including product efficacy  safety  price and cost effectiveness  marketing effectiveness  product labeling  quality control and quality assurance of its manufacturing operations  and research and development of new products 
to successfully compete for business in the health care industry  the company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits  as well as cost advantages 
currently  most of the company s new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category  in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future 
the company manufactures branded products  which are priced higher than generic products 
generic competition is one of the company s leading challenges globally 
in the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry  the majority of an innovative product s commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity 
when a product loses exclusivity  it is no longer protected by a patent and is 
table of contents subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands 
upon exclusivity loss  the company can lose a major portion of that product s sales in a short period of time 
currently  generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under us law 
however  the law could change in the future 
even in the absence of new legislation  the us food and drug administration fda is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics 
competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data  and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing  which involves more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
both in the us and internationally  the health care industry is subject to various government imposed regulations that authorize prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on the company s sales 
in the us  congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
driven in part by budget concerns  medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others 
in addition  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the us this legislation has had a modest favorable impact on the company  as a result of an increase in the number of seniors with drug coverage 
there continues to be a potential negative impact on the us pharmaceutical business that could result from pricing pressures or controls 
in many markets outside the us  the company operates in environments of government mandated  cost containment programs  or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing 
pricing freedom is limited in the united kingdom uk  for instance  by the operation of a profit control plan and in germany by the operation of a reference price system 
companies also face significant delays in market access for new products and more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some national markets 
the growth of managed care organizations mcos in the us has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the health care industry 
mcos seek to reduce health care expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers 
because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants  marketing prescription drugs to mcos has become an important part of the company s strategy 
companies compete for inclusion in a mco formulary and the company has generally been successful in having its major products included 
the company believes that developments in the managed care industry  including continued consolidation  have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices 
pharmaceutical biotechnology production processes are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product 
shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals 
biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
as biologics become more important to the company s product portfolio  the company will continue to make arrangements with third party manufacturers  and to make substantial investments to increase its internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale 
one such investment is the building of a new state of the art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in devens  massachusetts  the construction of which began in may the company has maintained a competitive position in the market and strives to uphold this position  which is dependent on its success in discovering and developing innovative  cost effective products that serve unmet medical need 
recently  several of the company s competitors have announced cost reduction programs in an effort to reduce their respective cost bases and increase their productivity and competitiveness 
the company has also announced a three year pti to reduce costs  streamline operations and rationalize global manufacturing as part of its efforts to become a more productive and competitive biopharmaceutical company 
the company and its subsidiaries are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits  claims  proceedings and investigations 
it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these investigations or litigations
