critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
identified below are some of the more significant accounting policies followed by the company in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see note description of company and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in general  the company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met  which typically is when evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided or goods have been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues for services are recorded in the period the services are rendered 
revenues for products are recorded in the period delivered based on rental or sales prices established with the client or its insurer prior to delivery 
net patient service revenues are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by the customers and third party payers 
a provision for contractual adjustments is recorded as a reduction to net patient services revenues and consists of a the difference between the payer s allowable amount and the customary billing rate  and b services for which payment is denied by governmental or third party payors or otherwise deemed non billable 
the company records the provision for contractual adjustments based on a percentage of revenue using historical data 
due to the complexity of many third party billing arrangements  adjustments are sometimes made to amounts originally recorded 
these adjustments are typically identified and recorded upon cash receipts or claim denial 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the company reviews its accounts receivable balances on a periodic basis 
the provision for contractual allowances is the difference between the fee charged and the amount expected to be paid by the patient or the applicable third party payor 
management bases its estimates for the contractual allowance on the reimbursement rates established by the payor  the contracted rate with other third party payors or the historical experience when a specific contracted rates is not available 
provisions for doubtful accounts are primarily based on historical analysis of its records 
the analysis is based on patient and institutional client payment histories  the aging of the accounts receivable  and specific review of patient and institutional client records 
as actual collection experience changes  revisions to the allowance may be required 
any unanticipated change in customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from customers could have a material effect on the results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the reserves for estimated contractual allowances and doubtful accounts noted above 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has acquired several entities resulting in the recording of intangible assets  including goodwill  which represents the 
table of contents excess of the purchase price over the over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances  by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we assess goodwill related to reporting units for impairment and write down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
as of march   we have five distinct reporting units as follows services  hhe  hhe catalog  pharmacy and pharmacy software 
each reporting unit represents a distinct business unit that offers different products and services 
segment management monitors each unit separately 
sfas no 
requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings for comparable companies 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we are required to perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
sfas no 
also requires that the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the estimated economic benefit method over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the income approach  which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets  is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized currently for the future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as for tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred tax asset 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and review the amount of such allowance periodically 
when we determine certain deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be utilized  we will reduce our valuation allowance accordingly 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
internal revenue code section rules limit the utilization of net operating losses following a change in control of a company 
it has been determined that a change in control of the company took place at the time of the reverse merger in therefore  the company s ability to utilize certain net operating losses generated by critical home care will be subject to severe limitations in future periods  which could have an effect of eliminating substantially all the future income tax benefits of the respective net operating losses 
tax benefits from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded at such time as they are considered more likely than not to be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our cash balances and cash equivalents are held primarily in highly liquid commercial bank accounts 
the company utilizes lines of credit to fund operational cash needs 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our cash equivalents and our borrowings 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
all revenues since inception have been in the us and in us dollars  therefore  management has not yet adopted a strategy for foreign currency rate exposure as it is not anticipated that foreign revenues are likely to occur in the near future
