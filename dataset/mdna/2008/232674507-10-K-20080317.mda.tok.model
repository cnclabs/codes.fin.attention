item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products and personalized medicine laboratory services that allow physicians to serve unmet medical needs 
we are developing milnacipran for fibromyalgia fm and with our recent acquisition of proprius pharmaceuticals  inc  or proprius  a formerly privately held company and now a subsidiary of ours  we have expanded our strategy to include providing personalized medicine laboratory services to rheumatologists 
personalized medicine laboratory services are laboratory developed tests which are validated analytically and clinically to provide physicians with actionable information to help manage their patients care  including predicting the likelihood of developing disease or optimizing therapy 
we also intend to build a sales force to launch the personalized medicine laboratory services around late we have exercised the right granted by our partner  forest laboratories  inc  or forest laboratories  to co promote our leading product for fm  milnacipran  and intend to detail it to rheumatologists  pain centers  and physical and rehabilitation medicine specialists 
offering integrated diagnostic and therapeutic services through the same sales organization could facilitate physician access and improve the quality of the sales call  as well as help establish cypress as a leader targeting these specific specialists 
we also have a number of proof of concept poc stage opportunities in development  including two early clinical stage pharmaceutical candidates acquired from proprius  a product to treat pain and a product to treat rheumatoid arthritis  and intend to pursue these opportunities on an ongoing basis 
we continue to evaluate various other potential strategic transactions  including the acquisition of products  product candidates  technologies and companies  and other alternatives 
one of our goals is to be one of the leading companies to commercialize a product approved in the united states for the treatment of fm 
milnacipran has been approved for a non pain condition in over countries  with commercial experience outside the us since we obtained an exclusive license for milnacipran from pierre fabre medicament  or pierre fabre  in in december  we completed a phase ii trial evaluating milnacipran for the treatment of fm 
in our phase ii trial  milnacipran was shown to improve pain and fatigue symptoms among patients with fm 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  a leading marketer of central nervous system  or cns  drugs with a strong franchise in the primary care and psychiatric markets 
as part of this collaboration with forest laboratories  we sublicensed our rights to milnacipran to forest laboratories for the united states  with an option to extend the territory to include canada  which was exercised in july as part of our agreements with both forest laboratories and pierre fabre  we have licensed any patents that may issue from our patent applications related to fm and milnacipran to forest laboratories and pierre fabre 
in september  we announced the top line results from the first phase iii trial with milnacipran  an patient randomized  six month  double blind  placebo controlled pivotal study 
although our pre specified primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance at the p level  we believed that the preliminary results supported continuation of the development program 
in may  we announced top line results from our second phase iii trial for milnacipran  which was a  patient randomized  three month  double blind  placebo controlled pivotal phase iii study 
the results demonstrated statistically significant therapeutic effects of milnacipran as a treatment for fm 
in this study  patients were randomized to receive either mg per day of milnacipran  mg per day of milnacipran or placebo 
the pre defined primary endpoints of this trial were composite responder assessments  which had previously been agreed to with the fda 
this composite responder analysis approach  which requires a clinically meaningful improvement in multiple domains  captures in one endpoint improvement in numerous symptoms which comprise fm 

table of contents in december  cypress and forest laboratories announced that we had recently submitted the milnacipran nda to the fda 
in february  the fda accepted for review the nda for milnacipran for the treatment of fm 
with a standard month review timeline  the fda pdufa target action date is the end of october additional information on our ongoing clinical development program for milnacipran can be found at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
in march  we announced the closing of the acquisition of proprius that included an upfront payment of approximately million in cash  as well as an additional million in potential milestone related payments associated with the development of proprius early clinical stage therapeutic candidates  which include a product to treat pain and a product to treat ra 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement with forest laboratories of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues under our collaborative agreement is due to a million milestone payment received from forest laboratories in june as a consequence of the results of our second phase iii trial for milnacipran and a million milestone payment received from forest laboratories in december upon nda filing 
the increase in revenues under our collaborative agreement was partially offset by a decrease in sponsored development reimbursements during for costs incurred in connection with the extension trial to our first phase iii trial  which was completed during the fourth quarter of  and the third phase iii trial  which was initiated during the first quarter of the revenues recorded during and consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  entered into in january  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  an additional million license payment received from forest laboratories in july to extend the territory to include canada recognized on a straight line basis over the remainder of the year amortization period  sponsored development reimbursements  funding received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran and milestone payments received from forest laboratories during the second and fourth quarters of we currently are not generating any revenues from milnacipran product sales 
unless and until we generate revenues from product or service sales  we expect our revenues to consist of the continued recognition on a straight line basis of the upfront payment of million and million license payment to extend the territory to include canada  sponsored development reimbursements and funding for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran 
we may also recognize future milestone payments under our agreement with forest laboratories  which are contingent upon the 
table of contents achievement of agreed upon objectives and which are not guaranteed payments 
in connection with our arrangement with forest laboratories regarding cost sharing arrangements for the second phase iii trial only  the amount of funding that we received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees was eliminated as of the fourth quarter in and resumed with the initiation of the third phase iii trial in the first quarter of additionally  the amount of sponsored development reimbursements from forest laboratories may change periodically based on the level of development activity 
our collaboration agreement is subject to early termination by forest laboratories upon specified events  including breach of the agreement 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year december  the decrease in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the completion of our extension trial to our first phase iii trial during the fourth quarter of  a decrease in costs incurred during in connection with the second phase iii trial  which was completed in the second quarter of  the discontinuation of our osa program during the second quarter of and funding provided during the first quarter of as an unrestricted grant to a university 
this decrease in research and development expenses was partially offset by costs incurred during in connection with the preparation of our nda  the initiation of proof of concept studies during for new compounds and increased wages expense associated with bonuses earned during and an increase in headcount 
during the year ended december   we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million during the year ended december  the costs for the extension trial to the first phase iii trial and the third phase iii clinical trial are being reimbursed by forest laboratories as noted below 
effective january   pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
this funding received from forest laboratories for sponsored development reimbursements is included as a component of our revenue under the collaborative agreement on the statement of operations 
we agreed upon an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only 
in connection with this arrangement  we paid for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest laboratories reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased wages expense associated with bonuses earned during and an increase in headcount  as well as higher legal fees during due to increased patent filing activity  increased nasdaq fees for the listing of additional shares issued in connection with our secondary offering completed in june and increased share based compensation expense related to options granted during interest income interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in is primarily due to an increase in our cash and investment balances during due to proceeds received from our secondary offering completed in june 
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues under our collaborative agreement was primarily due to a decrease in sponsored development reimbursements during for costs incurred in connection with the first phase iii trial  which was completed during the second half of  and the extension trial to our first phase iii trial  which achieved full enrollment during the second quarter of this decrease in revenues under our collaborative agreement was partially offset by funding received from forest laboratories during for certain of our employees assisting with the conduct of the third phase iii clinical trial  which was initiated during the first quarter of the revenues recorded during and consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  entered into in january  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  sponsored development reimbursements and funding received from forest laboratories during for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs incurred during due to the completion of our first phase iii trial during the second half of and full enrollment of the extension trial to our first phase iii trial during the second quarter of and a decrease in costs incurred during in connection with our osa program  which was discontinued during the second quarter of also contributing to the decrease were license fees of million including a warrant valued at million to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of issued to organon in connection with the licensing agreement incurred during related to our prior osa program 
the decrease in research and development expenses during was partially offset by an increase in costs incurred during in connection with the second phase iii trial  which was increased in size in january  the initiation of our third phase iii trial during the first quarter of and the recognition of stock based compensation expense for employee stock options in connection with the adoption of fas r on january  during the year ended december   we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million during the year ended december  the costs for the first phase iii clinical trial  the extension trial and the third phase iii clinical trial are being reimbursed by forest laboratories as noted above 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense of million for employee stock options in connection with the adoption of fas r on january  this increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a success based fee paid to advisors during the second quarter of in connection with the closing of our licensing agreement with organon 

table of contents in addition  as discussed below in compensation benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of million related to general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compensation benefit variable stock options in june  we implemented an option cancel and re grant program  which prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r on january  resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb accordingly  during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined due to a decrease in our stock price during the period  we recognized a compensation benefit of million related to general and administrative expenses 
upon the adoption of fas r in fiscal  as variable accounting for stock options ceased and all options outstanding pursuant to the option cancel and re grant program were fully vested prior to january   no additional compensation expense for such options was recognized during the year ended december  interest income interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in was primarily due to a general increase in interest rates and related yields experienced during compared to liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in high quality marketable debt instruments of governmental agencies  commercial paper and certificates of deposit  which are within federally insured limits 
we have established guidelines relating to our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
on march   we completed the acquisition of proprius for consideration totaling million in cash 
net cash provided by operating activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash from operations during the year ended december  was the million in aggregate milestone payments received from forest laboratories and the million license payment received from forest laboratories to extend the territory to include canada  offset by cash used in operations of approximately million and million for changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary use of cash during the year ended december  were actual expenditures to fund our operating activities during the period 
net cash used in investing activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the fluctuation in net cash from investing activities during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily a result of a net increase in the purchases of short term securities during the year ended december  due to additional cash available from proceeds received from our public offering completed in june 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities as disclosed in our statement of cash flows was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during compared to was primarily the result of net proceeds of approximately million from the completion of our secondary offering of common stock during june and proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options during compared to proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options during the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations at december  less than year years years more than total years operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services  including consulting services  that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
this includes contracts that are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude accrued liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  other commercial and contractual commitments include potential milestone payments of up to million to pierre fabre and sublicense payments to pierre fabre based on of any upfront and milestone payments received from forest laboratories  milestone payments up to million associated with the development of proprius therapeutic candidates  milestone payments of up to million to alpharx  milestone payments of up to million to collegium pharmaceutical  inc in connection with the reformulation and new product agreement entered into with collegium  milestone payments up to approximately million in connection with license agreements related to our poc programs and milestone payments up to million in connection with license agreements related to certain personalized medicine laboratory services 
in the event we move forward with development of a product or service under any of these arrangments  in most instances  we would also be obligated to make royalty payments 
on march   we completed the acquisition of proprius for consideration totaling million in cash  plus additional payments up to an aggregate of million in the event certain milestones associated with the development of proprius therapeutic candidates are achieved 
contractual obligations for which we will be reimbursed by forest laboratories are not included in the table above 
additionally  our current lease agreement for our executive and administrative offices was extended to july and is reflected in the table above  and we are currently searching for new office space due to the recent acquisition of proprius 
unless and until we can consistently generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities  from revenue under our collaboration agreement with forest and  if available to us  cash from financings 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share resulting in proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting and offering costs 

table of contents our current expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the development of milnacipran and certain personalized medicine laboratory services  including the early ra prediction algorithm and mtx polyglutamates test  establishment of a commercial infrastructure  and general research  working capital and other general corporate purposes and the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products and services 
in addition to the amounts payable under our merger agreement with proprius and our agreements with pierre fabre  alpharx  collegium and various licensors under our poc trials and personalized medicine laboratory services business and the costs of in licensing or acquiring additional compounds or companies and funding clinical development for any product other than our fm product and our ongoing poc trials that we may in license or acquire  we estimate that based on our current business plan  we will require approximately million to fund our operations for the year  which includes funding of operations related to proprius 
in addition  one of our ongoing goals is to continue to identify and in license new products and product candidates 
in the event we acquire  license or develop any new products or product candidates  or begin any new poc  the amount to fund our operations for would increase  possibly materially 
our net losses will continue for at least the next several years as we seek to acquire  license or develop additional products  product candidates and services 
such losses may fluctuate  and the fluctuations may be substantial 
based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  are sufficient to fund operations through at least however  we are actively continuing to evaluate various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  product candidates and companies  and other alternatives 
in order to acquire or develop additional products and product candidates  we will require additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many forward looking factors that could significantly increase our capital requirements  including the following the costs and timing of development and regulatory approvals for milnacipran and the products and services we acquired in connection with the proprius acquisition  the costs of establishing a commercial infrastructure  the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  product candidates and businesses  the costs of in licensing drug candidates  the ability of forest laboratories and us to reach milestones  and other events or developments under our collaboration agreement  and the costs of commercialization of any future products and services 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
unless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of product and service revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future capital needs through public or private debt or equity offerings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as interest income earned on cash balances 
we do not currently have any commitments or specific plans for future external funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development of existing or future product candidates and personalized medicine laboratory services 

table of contents to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received for upfront license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period such arrangements require on going services or performance 
accordingly  the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories is being recognized over a period of years  which represents the estimated period of significant on going services and performance  including the development period  under our agreement with forest laboratories 
additionally  the million license payment received from forest laboratories in july to extend the territory to include canada is being recognized over the remainder of the year amortization period related to original upfront payment 
amounts received for sponsored development activities  including funding received for certain of our employees  are recognized as research costs are incurred over the period specified in the related agreement or as the services are performed 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  which requires substantive effort and was not readily assured at the inception of the agreement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for our research and development personnel  fees paid to external service providers to conduct clinical trials  patient enrollment costs  fees and milestone payments under our license and development agreements and costs for facilities  supplies  materials and equipment 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on completion of patient studies and other events 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
historically  adjustments have not resulted in material changes to research and development expenses  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected term of employee stock options  the expected volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the output derived under the simplified method  as allowed under sab we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant using our historical price volatility based on our assessment that this approach is the most representative of future stock price trends 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we have very few employees and our historical turnover has been minimal 
therefore  we have not estimated forfeitures and instead adjust our stock based compensation expense as forfeitures occur 
we believe that the impact on share based compensation between estimating forfeitures and recording the impact as the forfeitures occur would not be material 

table of contents for options granted before january  and on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
as noted above  in order to calculate the compensation expense that we must recognize  we must make a variety of assumptions  all of which are based on our beliefs  expectations and assumptions at the time the assumptions are made 
these beliefs  expectations and assumptions may vary over time and we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
 which includes an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  permits entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are in the process of determining the impact that sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
the consensus requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties and recognize the expense over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
eitf issue no 
is effective for new contracts entered into in fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf issue no 
is effective for collaborative arrangements in place at the beginning of the annual period beginning after december  we are in the process of determining the impact that eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which replaces sfas no the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our results of operations and cash flows will depend on the terms and timing of future acquisitions  if any 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and will apply prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retroactively 
we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have invested our excess cash in united states government securities  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve over a three month period would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
