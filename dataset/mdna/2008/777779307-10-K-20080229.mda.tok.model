a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the terms of our indebtedness  including the financial covenants and obligations associated with the lawsuit under our credit facilities  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders for our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to us  and they and the lenders of our second lien term loan could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness 
in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral securing the facilities 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 
properties we acquire may not produce as expected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 
we continually review opportunities to acquire producing properties  undeveloped acreage and drilling prospects  however  such reviews are not capable of identifying all potential conditions 
generally  it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition 
ordinarily  we will focus our review efforts on higher value properties or properties with known adverse conditions and will sample the remainder 
however  even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their condition  any deficiencies  and development potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as ground water contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  which are common in the gulf of mexico during certain times of the year  compliance with governmental regulations  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  and 
table of contents limitations in the market for oil and natural gas 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
numerous uncertainties are inherent in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and our estimated reserve quantities and present value calculations may not be accurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
as noted above  the estimated reserve quantities and present value calculations exclude the estimates attributable to interests in certain leases and wells being a portion of the non consent properties specified in the purchase agreement 
the estimated reserve quantities and present value calculations include properties subject to additional documentation  or completion of documentation  including ministerial actions by federal or state agencies for which we believe calpine is contractually obligated to assist in resolving  along with certain other leases  concerning which calpine has asserted an ownership interest under its section motion and order in the bankruptcy court 
the estimated reserve quantities and present value calculations may be impacted depending on the outcome of the lawsuit and whether calpine assumes or rejects the purchase agreement 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our engineers control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  expenditures for future development and exploration activities  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas 
as an example  netherland sewell s reserve report for year end includes the downward revision for certain proved undeveloped reserves located in south texas due to the actual production performance history for wells we have drilled in this area since the acquisition 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses  underlying information  quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information set forth herein 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on fixed prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
in addition  discounted future net cash flows are estimated assuming royalties to the mms  royalty owners and other state and federal regulatory agencies with respect to our affected properties  and will be paid or suspended during the life of the properties based upon oil and natural gas prices as of the date of the estimate 
since actual future prices fluctuate over time  royalties may be required to be paid for various portions of the life of the properties and suspended for other portions of the life of the properties 
the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with the sec s rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at an accurate net present value of future net cash flows 
we are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation which may result in a write down of our estimated net reserves 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
however  the associated hedge adjusted market prices of oil and gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a write down if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a write down might otherwise be required 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period 

table of contents for the year ended december   there was no write down recorded 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  should natural gas prices decline in the future  it is possible that a write down could occur 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies and estimates for further information 
government laws and regulations can change 
our activities are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations 
extensive laws  regulations and rules relate to activities and operations in the oil and gas industry 
some of the laws  regulations and rules contain provisions for significant fines and penalties for non compliance 
changes in laws and regulations could affect our costs of operations and our profitability 
changes in laws and regulations could also affect production levels  royalty obligations  price levels  environmental requirements  and other matters affecting our business 
we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations or additions to laws and regulations 
such changes could significantly impact our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
our business requires a sufficient level of staff with technical expertise  specialized knowledge and training and a high degree of management experience 
our success is largely dependent our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and experience required for our business 
an inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with critical skills could have a negative effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 
our results are subject to commodity price fluctuations related to seasonal and market conditions and reservoir and production risks 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and could be negatively impacted in the future as a result of a number of factors  including seasonal variations in oil and natural gas prices  variations in levels of production  and the completion of exploration and production projects 
the ultimate outcome of the legal proceedings relating to our activities cannot be predicted 
any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
operation of our properties has generated various litigation matters arising out of the normal course of business 
in connection with the transfer and assumption agreement with calpine  we generally assumed liabilities arising from our activities from and after the acquisition  including defense of future litigation and claims involving calpine s domestic oil and natural gas reserve properties conveyed in the acquisition  other than certain litigation that calpine and its subsidiaries retained liability or agreed to indemnify the company by agreement 
calpine s bankruptcy may affect its obligations for the retained liabilities and claims 
the ultimate outcome of claims and litigation relating to our activities cannot presently be determined  nor can the liability that may potentially result from a negative outcome be reasonably estimated at this time for every case 
the liability we may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued with respect to such matters and  as a result  these matters may potentially be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing and transportation or the remote location of certain of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
in the gulf of mexico operations  the availability of a ready market depends on the proximity of and our ability to tie into existing production platforms owned or operated by others and the ability to negotiate commercially satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators 
under interruptible or short term transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system or for other reasons specified by the particular agreements 
we may be required to shut in natural gas wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity 
when that occurs  we are unable to realize revenue from those wells until the production can be tied to a gathering system 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization of revenues 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
many of our competitors  major and large independent oil and natural gas companies  possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
as a result of increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas  the demand for oilfield services has risen  and the costs of these services are increasing  while the quality of these services may suffer 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in texas and california  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in those areas 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  hurricanes  tropical storms  earthquakes  mud slides  and flooding  pollution  and releases of toxic gas 
the occurrence of one of the above may result in injury  loss of life  property damage  suspension of operations  environmental damage and remediation and or governmental investigations and penalties 
in addition  our operations in california are especially susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as earthquakes and fires and involve increased risks of personal injury  property damage and marketing interruptions 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition  or could result in a loss of our properties 
our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
for example  we are not fully insured against earthquake risk in california because of high premium costs 
insurance covering earthquakes or other risks may not be available at premium levels that justify its purchase in the future  if at all 
in addition  we are subject to energy package insurance coverage limitations related to any single named windstorm 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
insurance costs are expected to continue to increase over the next few years and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur a liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  then our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
because of the expense of the associated premiums and the perception of risk  we do not have any insurance coverage for any loss of production as may be associated with these operating hazards 

table of contents environmental matters and costs can be significant 
the oil and natural gas business is subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
such laws and regulations may impose liability on us for pollution clean up  remediation  restoration and other liabilities arising from or related to our operations 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
the cost of future compliance is uncertain and is subject to various factors  including future changes to laws and regulations 
we have no assurance that future changes in or additions to the environmental laws and regulations will not have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and future growth 
our acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes acquiring oil and natural gas businesses and properties if favorable economics and strategic objectives can be served 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including division of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from the acquired businesses and properties or realize other anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating in the gulf of mexico 
our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by unique conditions in the gulf of mexico because we explore and produce extensively in that area 
as a result of this activity  we are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating in the gulf of mexico  including those relating to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  oil field service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  remediation and other costs resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials  and failure of equipment or facilities 

table of contents further  production of reserves from reservoirs in the gulf of mexico generally decline more rapidly than from fields in many other producing regions of the world 
this results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the gulf of mexico during the initial years of production  and as a result  our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater there than for our operations elsewhere 
also  our revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
we have entered into natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a significant portion of our expected production through such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 
we have also entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the change in the variable interest rates associated with our debt under our credit facility 
if interest rates should fall below the rate established in the hedge  we could be exposed to losses associated with these hedges 
the historical financial results of the domestic oil and natural gas business of calpine may not be representative of our results as a separate company 
the combined historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
the costs and expenses reflect charges from calpine for centralized corporate services and infrastructure costs 
the allocations were determined based on calpine s methodologies 
this combined historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be in the future 
our prior and continuing relationship with calpine exposes us to risks attributable to calpine s businesses and credit worthiness 
we acquired a business that previously was integrated within calpine and is subject to liabilities and risk for activities of businesses of calpine other than the acquired business 
in connection with our separation from calpine  calpine and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed to retain and indemnify us for certain liabilities 
third parties may seek to hold us responsible for some or all of those retained liabilities 
any claims made against us that are properly attributable to calpine and certain of its subsidiaries will require us to exercise our rights under the indemnification provisions of the purchase agreement to obtain payment from them 
we are exposed to the risk that  in these circumstances and in light of the lawsuit  any or all of calpine and certain of its subsidiaries cannot or will not make the required payment 
if this were to occur  our business and results of operations  financial position or cash flow could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain governmental approvals arising from the acquisition and the ptra  we may not acquire all of calpine s domestic oil and gas business 
the consummation of the acquisition required various approvals  filings and recordings with governmental entities to transfer existing contracts and arrangements as well as all of calpine s domestic oil and gas properties to us 
in addition  all government issued permits and licenses that are important to our business  including permits issued by the city of rio vista and counties of sacramento  solano and contra costa  california  may require reapplication or application by us and reissuance or issuance in our name 
some of the required permits  licenses and approvals have been obtained or received  but certain others remain outstanding 
in connection with the ptra  we have submitted the required documents and are waiting for ministerial approvals from the mms 
if we are unable to obtain a reissuance or issuance of any contract  license or permit being transferred or the required approvals as operator and or lessee  as to certain oil and gas properties  our business and results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the sec informal inquiry relating to the downward revision of the estimate of continuing proved reserves  while owned by calpine  could have a material adverse effect on the presentation of our predecessor financial statements 
in april  the staff of the division of enforcement of the sec commenced an informal inquiry into the facts and circumstances relating to the downward revision of the estimate of continuing proved natural gas reserves at december   while the domestic oil and natural gas properties were owned by calpine 
calpine has advised us that it is fully cooperating with this informal inquiry which also involved two other non oil and natural gas related matters  and we have separately agreed with calpine that we will also fully cooperate 
calpine has not advised us of any change in the inactive status of the sec s informal inquiry in this regard 
our understanding is that calpine has not had any further response or inquiry from the sec staff in regard to this matter since july and that the ultimate outcome of this inquiry cannot presently be determined 
however  it is possible that the staff of the sec could conclude that the estimate of continuing proved reserves as of december   as revised  requires further downward revision  which could have a material adverse effect on the presentation of our predecessor financial statements 

table of contents future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline  which could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock 
stock sales and purchases by institutional investors or stockholders with significant holdings could have significant influence over our stock volatility and our corresponding ability to raise capital through debt or equity offerings 
because institutional investors have the ability to trade in large volumes of shares of our common stock  the price of our common stock could be subject to significant volatility  which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock as well as limit our ability to raise capital or issue additional equity in the future 
you may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common and preferred stock

we are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of  shares of capital stock consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors 
as of december    shares of common stock were issued  including  shares of restricted stock issued to certain employees and directors 
the majority of these shares vest over a three year period 
of the restricted stock that has been granted   shares had vested as of december  and the remaining shares will vest no later than pursuant to our long term incentive plan  we have reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance as restricted stock  stock options and or other equity based grants to employees and directors 
in addition  we have issued  options to purchase common stock issued to certain employees and directors  of which  have been exercised as of december  the potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock

unresolved staff comments none item properties a description of our properties is located in item business and is incorporated herein by reference 
our headquarters are located at texas  suite  houston  texas  where we sublease two floors of office space from calpine 
we also maintain a division office in denver  colorado  where we were assigned a lease by calpine and consequently deal directly with the landlord 
we also have field offices in laredo  texas  rio vista  california and magnolia  arkansas 
all leases were negotiated at market prices applicable to their respective location 

table of contents title to properties our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions as well as mortgage liens on at least of our proved reserves in accordance with our credit facilities 
we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interferes with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 
except as noted below in the open issues regarding legal title to certain properties section in item legal proceedings  we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties 
as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties 
we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets 
although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 
calpine s lawsuit and its possible rejection of the purchase agreement may delay or frustrate our ability to complete additional transfers of properties for which legal title was not obtained or secure curative documentation to correct possible clouds on title as of july  see item legal proceedings for further information concerning the lawsuit and calpine s possible rejection of the purchase agreement  and the effect of possible losses in connection with open issues regarding legal title to certain properties 
item legal proceedings we are party to various oil and natural gas litigation matters arising out of the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
calpine bankruptcy on december   calpine and certain of its subsidiaries filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws in the united states bankruptcy court of the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court 
on december   the bankruptcy court approved calpine s plan of reorganization 
on january   calpine and certain of its subsidiaries emerged from bankruptcy 
calpine s lawsuit against rosetta on june   calpine filed an adversary proceeding against us in the bankruptcy court the lawsuit 
the complaint alleges that the purchase by rosetta of the domestic oil and natural gas business owned by calpine the assets in july for billion  prior to calpine filing for bankruptcy  was completed when calpine was insolvent and was for less than a reasonably equivalent value 
through the lawsuit  calpine is seeking i monetary damages for the alleged shortfall in value it received for these assets which it estimates to be at least approximately million plus interest  or ii in the alternative  return of the assets from us 
we believe that the allegations in the lawsuit are without merit  and we continue to believe that it is unlikely that this challenge by calpine to the fairness of the acquisition will be successful upon the ultimate disposition of this litigation in the bankruptcy court  or if necessary  in the appellate courts 
the official committee of equity security holders and the official committee of the unsecured creditors both intervened in the lawsuit for the stated purpose of monitoring the proceedings because the committees claimed to have an interest in the lawsuit  which we dispute because we believe creditors may be paid in full under calpine s plan of reorganization without regard to the lawsuit and equity holders have no interest in fraudulent conveyance actions 
under calpine s plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court on december   the official committee of equity security holders was dissolved as of the january  effective date and no longer has any interest in the lawsuit 
while the unsecured creditors committee also was officially dissolved as of the same effective date  there are provisions under the approved plan of reorganization that will allow it to remain involved in lawsuits to which it is a party  which may include this lawsuit 
on september   we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit or in the alternative  to stay the lawsuit 
the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing upon our motion on october  following the hearing  the bankruptcy court denied our motion on the basis that certain issues we raised in our motion were premature as the bankruptcy process had not yet established how much calpine s creditors would receive 
on november   we filed our answer  affirmative defenses and counterclaims with respect to the lawsuit  denying the allegations set forth in both counts of the lawsuit  and asserting affirmative defenses to calpine s claims as well as affirmative counterclaims against calpine related to the acquisition for i breach of covenant of solvency  ii fraud and fraud in a real estate transaction  iii breach of contract  iv conversion  v civil theft and vi setoff 
the parties are currently in agreement that discovery may continue in the lawsuit until april the bankruptcy court has not set a trial date for the lawsuit 

table of contents remaining issues with respect to the acquisition separate from the calpine lawsuit  calpine has taken the position that the purchase and sale agreement and interrelated agreements concurrently executed therewith  dated july   by and among calpine  us  and various other signatories thereto collectively  the purchase agreement are executory contracts  which calpine may assume or reject 
following the july  closing of the acquisition and as of the date of calpine s bankruptcy filing  there were open issues regarding legal title to certain properties included in the purchase agreement 
on september   the bankruptcy court approved calpine s disclosure statement accompanying its proposed plan of reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code  in which calpine revealed it had not yet made a decision as to whether to assume or reject its remaining duties and obligations under the purchase agreement 
we may contend that the purchase agreement is not an executory contract which calpine may choose to reject 
if the court were to determine that the purchase agreement is an executory contract  we may contend the various agreements entered into as part of the transaction constitute a single contract for purposes of assumption or rejection under the bankruptcy code  and we may argue that calpine cannot choose to assume certain of the agreements and to reject others 
this issue may be contested by calpine 
if the purchase agreement is held to be executory  the deadline by when calpine must exercise its decision to assume or reject the purchase agreement and the further duties and obligations required therein would normally have been the date on which calpine s plan of reorganization was confirmed  however  in order to address certain issues  we and calpine have agreed to extend this deadline until fifteen days following the entry of a final  unappealable order in the lawsuit  and the parties set forth this agreement in the proposed plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court on december  open issues regarding legal title to certain properties under the purchase agreement  calpine is required to resolve the open issues regarding legal title to interests in certain properties 
at the closing of the acquisition on july   we retained approximately million of the purchase price in respect to leases and wells identified by calpine as requiring third party consents or waivers of preferential rights to purchase that were not received by the parties before closing non consent properties 
the interests in the non consent properties were not included in the conveyances delivered at the closing 
subsequent analysis determined that a significant portion of the non consent properties did not require consents or waivers 
for that portion of the non consent properties for which third party consents were in fact required and for which either us or calpine obtained the required consents or waivers  as well as for all non consent properties that did not require consents or waivers  we contend calpine was and is obligated to have transferred to us the record title  free of any mortgages and other liens 
the approximate allocated value under the purchase agreement for the portion of the non consent properties subject to a third party s preferential right to purchase is million 
we have retained million of the purchase price under the purchase agreement for the non consent properties subject to the third party preferential right  and  in addition  a post closing adjustment is required to credit us for approximately million for a property which was transferred to us but  if necessary  will be transferred to the appropriate third party under its exercised preferential purchase right upon calpine s performance of its obligations under the purchase agreement 
we believe all conditions precedent for our receipt of record title  free of any mortgages or other liens  for substantially all of the non consent properties excluding that portion of these properties subject to the third party preferential right were satisfied earlier  and certainly no later  than december   when we tendered the amounts necessary to conclude the settlement of the non consent properties 
we believe we are the equitable owner of each of the non consent properties for which calpine was and is obligated to have transferred the record title and that such properties are not part of calpine s bankruptcy estate 
upon our receipt from calpine of record title  free of any mortgages or other liens  to these non consent properties excluding that portion of these properties subject to a validly exercised third party s preferential right to purchase and further assurances required to eliminate any open issues on title to the remaining properties discussed below  we have been prepared to conclude the remaining aspects of the acquisition 
we have not included in our statement of operations for the years ended december  and and six months ended december   estimated net revenues and related estimated production from interests in certain leases and wells being a portion of the non consent properties  including those properties subject to preferential rights 
on september   the bankruptcy court entered an order approving that certain partial transfer and release agreement ptra negotiated by and between us and calpine which  among other things  resolves issues in regard to title of certain of the other oil and natural gas properties we purchased from calpine in the acquisition and for which payment was made to calpine on july   and we entered into a new marketing and services agreement msa with calpine producer services  lp cps for a two year period commencing on july  but which is subject to earlier termination by us on the occurrence of certain events 
the additional documentation received from calpine under the ptra eliminates any open issues in our title and resolves any issues as to the clarity of our ownership in certain properties located in the gulf of mexico  california  and wyoming the ptra properties  including all oil and gas properties requiring ministerial approvals  such as leases with the us minerals management service mms  california state lands commission cslc and us bureau of land management blm 
however  the ptra was executed without prejudice to calpine s fraudulent conveyance action or its right  if any  to reject the purchase agreement  and without prejudice to our rights and legal arguments in relation thereto  including our various counterclaims 
the ptra did not otherwise address or resolve issues with respect to the non consent properties and certain other properties 

table of contents we recorded the conveyances of those ptra properties in california not requiring governmental agency approval 
on october   the cslc approved the assignment of the state of california leases and rights of way to us from calpine and resolved open issues under an audit the state of california had conducted as to these properties 
while the documentation has been filed with the mms  we are still awaiting its ministerial approval for the assignment of calpine s interests in mms federal offshore leases for south pelto and south timalier to us 
notwithstanding the ptra  as a result of calpine s bankruptcy filing  it remains uncertain as to whether calpine will respond cooperatively as to the remaining outstanding issues under the purchase agreement 
if calpine does not fulfill its contractual obligations as a result of rejection of the purchase agreement or otherwise and does not complete the documentation necessary to resolve these remaining issues whether under the purchase agreement or the ptra  we will pursue all available remedies  including but not limited to a declaratory judgment to enforce our rights and actions to quiet title 
after pursuing these matters  if we experience a loss of ownership with respect to these properties without receiving adequate consideration for any resulting loss to us  an outcome our management considers to be unlikely upon ultimate disposition  including appeals  if any  then we could experience losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  statement of operations or cash flows 
sale of natural gas to calpine in addition to the issues involving legal title to certain properties  we executed  as part of the interrelated agreements that constitute the purchase agreement  certain natural gas sales agreements with calpine energy services  lp ces  which also filed for bankruptcy on december  during the period following calpine s filing for bankruptcy  ces has continued to make the required deposits into our margin account and to timely pay for natural gas production it purchases from our subsidiaries under these various natural gas sales agreements 
although calpine has indicated in a supplement to its recently proposed plan of reorganization that it intends to assume the ces natural gas sales agreements with us  we disagree that calpine may assume anything less than the entire purchase agreement and intend to oppose any effort by calpine to do less 
calpine s marketing of the company s production as part of the ptra  we entered into the msa with cps  effective july   which was approved by the bankruptcy court on september  under the msa  cps provides marketing and related services in relation to the sales of our natural gas production and charges us a fee 
this msa extends cps obligations to provide such services until june  the msa is subject to early termination by us upon the occurrence of certain events 
events within calpine s bankruptcy case on june   calpine filed a motion in connection with its pending bankruptcy proceeding in the bankruptcy court seeking the entry of an order authorizing calpine to assume certain oil and natural gas leases that calpine had previously sold or agreed to sell to us in the acquisition  to the extent those leases constitute unexpired leases of non residential real property and were not fully transferred to us at the time of calpine s filing for bankruptcy 
the oil and gas leases identified in calpine s motion are  in large part  those properties with open issues in regards to their legal title in certain oil and natural gas leases which calpine contends it may possess some legal interest 
according to this motion  calpine filed its pending bankruptcy proceeding in order to avoid the automatic forfeiture of any interest it may have in these leases by operation of a bankruptcy code deadline 
calpine s motion did not request that the bankruptcy court determine whether these properties belong to us or calpine  but we understand calpine s motion was meant to allow calpine to preserve and avoid forfeiture under the bankruptcy code of whatever interest calpine may possess  if any  in these oil and natural gas leases 
we dispute calpine s contention that it may have an interest in any significant portion of these oil and natural gas leases and intend to take the necessary steps to protect all of the our rights and interest in and to the leases 
certain of these properties have been subsequently addressed under the ptra discussed above 
on july   we filed an objection in response to calpine s motion  wherein we asserted that oil and natural gas leases constitute interests in real property that are not subject to assumption under the bankruptcy code 
in the objection  we also requested that a the bankruptcy court eliminate from the order certain federal offshore leases from the calpine motion because these properties were fully conveyed to us in july  and the mms has subsequently recognized us as owner and operator of all but two of these properties  two other leases of offshore properties having expired  and b any order entered by the bankruptcy court be without prejudice to  and fully preserve our rights  claims and legal arguments regarding the characterization and ultimate disposition of the remaining described oil and natural gas properties 
in our objection  we also urged the bankruptcy court to require the parties to promptly address and resolve any remaining issues under the pre bankruptcy definitive agreements with calpine and proposed to the bankruptcy court that the parties could seek mediation to complete the following 
table of contents calpine s conveyance of its retained interest in the non consent properties to us  calpine s execution of all documents and performance of all tasks required under further assurances provisions of the purchase agreement with respect to certain of the oil and natural gas properties for which we have already paid calpine  and resolution of the final amounts we are to pay calpine 
at a hearing held on july   the bankruptcy court took the following steps in response to an objection filed by the department of justice and asserted by the cslc that the debtors motion to assume non residential leases and set cure amounts the motion  did not allow adequate time for an appropriate response  calpine withdrew from the list of oil and gas leases that were the subject of the motion those leases issued by the united states and managed by the mms the mms oil and gas leases and the state of california and managed by the cslc the cslc leases 
calpine  the department of justice and the state of california agreed to an extension of the existing deadline to november  to assume or reject the mms oil and gas leases and cslc leases under section of the bankruptcy code  to the extent the mms oil and gas leases and cslc leases are leases subject to section the effect of these actions was to render our objection inapplicable at that time  and the bankruptcy court also encouraged calpine and us to arrive at a business solution to all remaining issues including approximately million payable to calpine for conveyance of the non consent properties excluding the properties subject to third party s preferential right 
on august   we filed a number of proofs of claim in the calpine bankruptcy asserting claims against a variety of calpine debtors seeking recovery of million in liquidated amounts  as well as unliquidated damages in amounts that have not presently been determined 
in the event that calpine elects to reject the purchase agreement or otherwise refuses to perform its remaining obligations therein  we anticipate we will be allowed to amend our proofs of claim to assert any additional damages we suffer as a result of the ultimate impact of calpine s refusal or failure to perform under the purchase agreement 
in the bankruptcy  calpine may elect to contest or dispute the amount of damages we seek in our proofs of claim 
we will assert all right to offset any of our damages against any funds we possess that may be owed to calpine 
until the allowed amount of our claims are finally established and the bankruptcy court issues its rulings with respect to calpine s approved plan of reorganization  we can not predict what amounts we may recover from the calpine bankruptcy should calpine reject or refuse to perform under the purchase agreement 
with respect to the stipulations between calpine and mms and calpine and cslc extending the deadline to assume or reject the mms oil and gas leases and the cslc leases respectively  these parties further extended this deadline by stipulation 
the deadline was first extended to january   was further extended to april  with respect to the mms oil and gas leases and april  with respect to the cslc leases  was further extended again to september  with respect to the mms oil and gas leases and july  and more recently  october  with respect to the cslc leases 
the bankruptcy court entered orders related to the mms oil and gas leases and cslc leases which included appropriate language that we negotiated with calpine for our protection in this regard 
the mms oil and gas leases and cslc leases were included in the ptra that was approved by the bankruptcy court on september   with the result that there is no further need for the parties to contest whether the mms oil and gas leases and the clsc leases are appropriate for inclusion in calpine s motion 
the ptra approved by the bankruptcy court  among other things  resolves open issues in regard to our title to ownership of all of the unexpired mms oil and gas leases and the clsc leases 
however  the ptra was executed without prejudice to calpine s fraudulent conveyance action or its rights  if any  to reject the purchase agreement and our rights and legal arguments in relation thereto 
on june   calpine filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
calpine had indicated in its filings with the court that it believed substantial payments in the form of cash or newly issued stock  or some combination thereof  would be made to unsecured creditors under its proposed plan of reorganization that could conceivably result in payment of of allowed claims and possibly provide some payment to its equity holders 
the amounts any plan ultimately distributes to its various claimants of the calpine estate  including unsecured creditors  will depend on the amount of allowed claims that remain following the objection process 
the bankruptcy court approved calpine s plan of reorganization on december   overruling our objection to the releases granted by this plan to prior and current directors and officers of calpine and certain of its law firms and other professional advisors 
on august   we executed the ptra  resolving certain open issues without prejudice to calpine s avoidance action and  if the court concludes the purchase agreement is executory  calpine s ability to assume or reject the purchase agreement 
the principal terms are as follows 
table of contents we entered into a new msa with cps through and until june   effective july  this agreement is subject to earlier termination right by us upon the occurrence of certain events  calpine delivers to us documents that resolve title issues pertaining to the properties defined as certain previously purchased oil and gas properties located in the gulf of mexico  california and wyoming  we assume all calpine s rights and obligations for an audit by the california state lands commission on part of the properties  and we assume all rights and obligations for the properties  including all plugging and abandonment liabilities 
on september   the bankruptcy court approved the ptra 
the ptra did not resolve the open issues on the non consent properties and certain other properties 
notwithstanding the ptra  as a result of calpine s bankruptcy  there remains the possibility that there will be issues between us and calpine that could amount to material contingencies in relation to the litigation filed by calpine against us or the purchase agreement  including unasserted claims and assessments with respect to i the still pending purchase agreement and the amounts that will be payable in connection therewith  ii whether or not calpine and its affiliated debtors will  in fact  perform their remaining obligations in connection with the purchase agreement and ptra  and iii the issues pertaining to the non consent properties 
arbitration between calpine rosetta and pogo producing company on september   calpine and calpine natural gas lp sold their new mexico oil and natural gas assets to pogo producing company pogo 
during the course of that sale  pogo made three title defect claims on properties sold by calpine valued at approximately million in the aggregate  subject to a million deductible assuming no reconveyance claiming that certain leases subject to the sale had expired because of lack of production 
with rosetta s assistance  calpine had undertaken without success to resolve this matter by obtaining ratifications of a majority of the questionable leases 
calpine filed for bankruptcy protection before pogo filed arbitration against it 
even though this is a retained liability of calpine  calpine had earlier declined to accept the company s tender of defense and indemnity when pogo filed for arbitration against us 
we filed a motion to stay this arbitration under the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code which motion was granted by the bankruptcy court on april  we intend to cooperate with calpine in defending against pogo s claim should it resume  however  it is too early for management to determine whether this matter will affect us  and if so  in what amount 
this is due  but not limited to uncertainity concerning whether or not pogo s proofs of claim will be fully satisfied by calpine under its approved plan of reorganization  and whether and if so  the extent to which  calpine may reimburse us for our claim for our defense costs and any arbitration award regarding the pogo claim

includes a million pre tax impairment charge for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of natural gas and oil properties in the united states 
we were formed as a delaware corporation in june in july  we acquired the oil and natural gas business of calpine corporation and affiliates 
we own producing and non producing oil and natural gas properties in the sacramento basin of california  the rocky mountains  the lobo and perdido trends in south texas  the state waters of texas and the gulf of mexico and other properties located in various geographical areas in the united states 
in this section  we refer to rosetta as successor and to the domestic oil and natural gas properties acquired from calpine as predecessor 
in accounting for the oil and natural gas exploration and production business  the predecessor used the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities 
however  in connection with our separation from calpine  we adopted the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties  see critical accounting policies and estimates oil and gas activities below for further discussion of the differences on the consolidated combined financial statements of the two accounting methods 
we plan our activities and budget based on conservative sales price assumptions given the inherent volatility of oil and natural gas prices that are influenced by many factors beyond our control 
we focus our efforts on increasing oil and natural gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our overall cost structure to a level that allows for profitable production 
our future earnings will also be impacted by the changes in the fair market value of hedges we executed to mitigate the volatility in the changes of oil and natural gas prices in future periods 
these instruments meet the criteria to be accounted for as cash flow hedges  and until settlement  the changes in fair market value of our hedges will be included as a component of stockholder s equity to the extent effective 
in periods of rising prices  these transactions will mitigate future earnings and in periods of declining prices will increase future earnings in the respective period the positions are settled 
in addition  we have also entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the change in variable interest rates associated with our debt under our credit facility 
in periods where interest rates rise  these hedges will mitigate losses to future earnings 
in periods of falling interest rates  these hedges will expose us to losses in future earnings 

table of contents like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
as initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil and natural gas production from a given well naturally decreases 
thus  an oil and natural gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or natural gas it produces 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling and acquiring more reserves than we produce 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production 
we will maintain our focus on adding reserves through drilling and acquisitions  while placing a clear priority on lowering the company s cost of replacing reserves 
consistent with our stated strategies  we will emphasize building a high quality inventory of future drilling projects while also focusing on improving our capital and cost efficiency 
we have several efforts underway to address this challenge 
we have set a goal to fully assess our existing asset portfolio during we will implement a formal capital performance lookback process to monitor where value is being created 
in addition  we will form technical teams to study the resource potential of our current assets  many of which we believe may yield significant future drilling inventory through down spacing programs  deeper or shallower programs or close extensions 
the combination of more inventory and calibration on our programs from the lookback exercise should allow us to deliver better performance on our future capital spending 
we also expect to launch several of significant resource assessments in basins  trends  or plays where significant inventory can be identified 
we are considering several areas where we have technical expertise that could be applied to new or extension opportunities 
this effort will service existing asset optimization as well as our merger and acquisition efforts 
finally  we will undertake to improve our capital and cost efficiency on an ongoing business 
we will look for opportunities to attract additional experienced personnel with successful track records  streamline or improve processes and organize for profitable growth 
in addition to the capital lookback process  we expect to bolster several other core analytic functions  including reserve engineering  business analysis and planning 
financial highlights our consolidated financial statements reflect total revenue of million on total volumes of bcfe for the year ended december  successor 
operating income was million  or of total revenue  and included lease operating expense of million and million of compensation expense for stock based compensation granted to employees 
total net other income was comprised of interest expense net of capitalized interest on our long term debt offset by interest income on short term cash investments 
overall  our net income for the year ended december  successor was million  or of total revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments for our financial statements and those of our predecessor 
we believe these accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the financial statements 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies
