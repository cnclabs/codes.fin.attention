item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
marketing and sales our marketing strategy is based upon the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential 
our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing professionally designed  creative and cost effective advertising and promotional programs 
after we acquire a brand  we implement a brand building strategy that uses the brand s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides a vehicle to drive growth through product innovation 
this brand building process involves the evaluation and enhancement of the existing brand name  the development and introduction of innovative new products and the execution of professionally designed support programs 
recognizing that financial resources are limited  we allocate our resources to focus on those brands that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success 
brand priorities vary from year to year and generally revolve around new product introductions 
customers our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long standing relationships with our top domestic customers  which accounted for approximately of our combined gross sales for and and for and  respectively 
our sales management team consists of people and is expected to grow in order to focus on our key customer relationships 
we also contract with third party sales management enterprises that interface directly with our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team 
we enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels  including mass merchandisers  drug  food  dollar and club stores 
the following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales across our five major distribution channels during the three year period ended march  percentage of gross sales channel of distribution mass food drug dollar club other includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel 
due to the diversity of our product line  we believe that each of these channels is important to our business and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel 
our principal customer relationships include wal mart  walgreens  cvs  target and dollar general 
gross sales to our top five and ten customers account for and  respectively  in compared with approximately and  respectively  in and approximately and  respectively  in no single customer other than wal mart accounted for more than of our gross sales in any of those years and none of our other top five customers accounted for less than of our gross sales in any those years 
our top ten customers each purchase products from essentially all of our major brands 
our strong customer relationships and product recognition provide us with a number of important benefits including i minimization of slotting fees  ii maximization of new product introductions  iii maximization of shelf space prominence and iv minimization of cash collection days 
we believe that management s emphasis on strong customer relationships  speed and flexibility  leading sales technology capabilities  including i electronic data interchange  ii e mail  iii the internet  iv integrated retail coverage  v consistent marketing support programs and vi ongoing product innovation will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment 
the following table sets forth a list of our primary distribution channels and our principal customers for each channel distribution channel customers distribution channel customers mass kmart drug cvs meijer rite aid target walgreens wal mart dollar dollar general food ahold dollar tree kroger family dollar publix safeway club bj s wholesale club supervalu costco sam s club outsourcing and manufacturing in order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources  third party manufacturers fulfill all of our manufacturing needs 
we have found that contract manufacturing maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures 
we select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value  including factors such as i depth of services  ii professionalism and integrity of the management team  iii manufacturing flexibility  iv regulatory compliance and v competitive pricing 
we also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer s facilities  quality standards  capacity and financial stability 
we generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers 
our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods 
they are responsible for such matters as i production planning  ii product research and development  iii procurement  iv production  v quality testing  and vi almost all capital expenditures 
in most instances  we provide our contract manufacturers with guidance in the areas of i product development  ii performance criteria  iii regulatory guidance  iv sourcing of packaging materials and v monthly master production schedules 
this management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow  which is reinvested to support our marketing initiatives  used to fund brand acquisitions or to repay outstanding indebtedness 
we have relationships with over third party manufacturers 
of those  our top manufacturers produce items that accounted for of our sales for compared to in we do not have long term contracts with the manufacturers of products of approximately of our gross sales in the lack of manufacturing agreements for these products exposes us to the risk that the manufacturer could stop producing our products at any time  for any reason or fail to provide us with the level of products we need to meet our customers demands 
should one or more of our manufacturers stop producing product on our behalf  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
at march   suppliers for our key brands included i procter gamble  ii access business group  iii kolmar canada and iv altaire pharmaceuticals  inc we enter into manufacturing agreements for a majority of our products by sales volume  each of which vary based on the capabilities of the third party manufacturer and the products being supplied 
these agreements explicitly outline the manufacturer s obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced 
the purchase price of products under these agreements is subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in raw material  packaging and labor costs 
all of our other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis which is generally based on batch sizes and result in no long term obligations or commitments 
warehousing and distribution we receive orders from retailers and or brokers primarily by electronic data interchange  which automatically enters each order into our computer systems and then routes the order to our distribution center 
the distribution center will  in turn  send a confirmation that the order was received  fill the order and ship the order to the customer  while sending a shipment confirmation to us 
upon receipt of the confirmation  we send an invoice to the customer 
we manage product distribution in the mainland united states primarily through one facility located in st 
louis  owned and operated by the jacobson companies jacobson 
jacobson handles all finished goods storage  as well as the receipt and disposition of customer returns 
in addition  jacobson provides warehouse services  including without limitation  storage  handling and shipping with respect to our full line of products  as well as transportation services  including without limitation  i complete management services  ii claims administration  iii proof of delivery  iv procurement  v report generation  and vi automation and freight payment services with respect to our full line of products 
if jacobson abruptly stopped providing warehousing or transportation services to us  our business operations could suffer a temporary disruption while new service providers are engaged 
we believe this process could be completed quickly and any temporary disruption resulting therefrom would not be likely to have a significant effect on our operating results and financial condition 
however  a serious disruption  such as a flood or fire  to our distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost 
we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our customers during the time required to reopen or replace our distribution center 
as a result  any such serious or prolonged disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
competition the business of selling brand name consumer products in the over the counter healthcare  household cleaning and personal care categories is highly competitive 
these markets include numerous national and global manufacturers  distributors  marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers business both in the united states and abroad 
many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do  and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on advertising and marketing and research and development  and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
if this were to occur  our sales  operating results and profitability could be adversely affected 
our principal competitors vary by industry category 
competitors in the over the counter healthcare category include johnson johnson  maker of visine  which competes with our clear eyes and murine brands  mcneil ppc  maker of tylenol sore throat  procter gamble  maker of vicks  and combe incorporated  maker of cepacol  each of which compete with our chloraseptic brand 
other competitors in the over the counter healthcare category include schering plough  maker of dr 
scholl s  which competes with our compound w and wartner brands  johnson johnson  maker of band aid brand liquid bandage  which competes with our new skin brand  glaxosmithkline  maker of debrox  which competes with our murine ear care brand  sunstar america  inc  maker of gum line of oral care products  as well as dentek oral care  inc  power products  inc 
and ranir llc  each of which markets a dental protector for nighttime teeth grinding  which competes with the doctor s nightguard dental protector 
competitors in the household cleaning category include henkel  maker of soft scrub  and clorox  maker of tilex  each of which competes with our comet brand 
additionally  clorox s pine sol and procter gamble s mr 
clean compete with our spic and span brand while m  maker of scotch brite and o cel o  and clorox s sos  compete with our chore boy brand 
competitors in the personal care category include johnson johnson  maker of t gel shampoo  and chattem  maker of selsun blue  which compete with our denorex brand  as well as coty  inc  maker of sally hansen  which competes with our cutex brand 
we compete on the basis of numerous factors  including brand recognition  product quality  performance  price and product availability at the retail level 
advertising  promotion  merchandising and packaging  the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers buying decisions and  as a result  on our sales 
the structure and quality of our sales force  as well as sell through of our products  affects in store position  wall display space and inventory levels in retail outlets 
if we are unable to maintain the inventory levels and in store positioning of our products in retail stores  our sales and operating results will be adversely affected 
our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
an increase in the amount of product introductions by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
regulation product regulation the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including the fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission cpsc  the environmental protection agency epa  and by various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed and sold 
our regulatory team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate legal and regulatory experience 
our regulatory and operations teams work closely with our third party manufacturers on quality related matters while we monitor their compliance with fda regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure such compliance 
this continual evaluation process ensures that our manufacturing processes and products are of the highest quality and in compliance with all known regulatory requirements 
when and if the fda chooses to audit a particular manufacturing facility  we are required to be notified immediately and updated on the progress of the audit as it proceeds 
if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue the sale of the non compliant product  which could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
all of our over the counter drug products are regulated pursuant to the fda s monograph system 
the monographs  both tentative and final  set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of over the counter drug products 
when the fda has finalized a particular monograph  it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded 
a tentative final monograph indicates that the fda has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses 
however  unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue  the fda typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published 
products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre market approval from the fda 
the company s over the counter healthcare products that contain a medical device are regulated by fda through a system which usually involves pre market clearance 
during the review process  the fda makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions  cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question 
in accordance with the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdc act and fda regulations  the manufacturing processes of our third party drug and device manufacturers must also comply with the fda s current good manufacturing processes cgmps 
the fda inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine that both the company and our third party manufacturers are complying with cgmps 
in october  we removed two medicated pediatric cough and cold products marketed under the little remedies brand from the marketplace 
this action was part of an industry wide voluntary withdrawal of these items pending the final recommendations of an fda advisory board meeting to review the safety and efficacy of these products 
we are planning to reintroduce those products into the marketplace with revised packaging  labeling  directions and warnings that we believe will be in compliance with the fda s regulatory requirements 
we anticipate that fda will provide guidance on the labeling no later than the end of june other regulations we are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets  including regulations pertaining to import export regulations and antitrust issues 
to the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries  we may be required to obtain an approval  license or certification from the country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country 
government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction  or require the reformulation or withdrawal  of some of our products 
our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market  either temporarily or permanently 
in addition  we are subject to ftc and state regulations  as well as foreign regulations  relating to our product claims and advertising 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
certain of our household cleaning products are considered pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra 
generally speaking  any substance intended for preventing  destroying  repelling  or mitigating any pest which includes bacteria is considered to be a pesticide under fifra 
we market and distribute certain products under our comet and spic and span brands which make antibacterial and or disinfectant claims 
due to the antibacterial and or disinfectant claims on certain of the comet and spic and span products  such products are considered to be pesticides under fifra and are required to be registered with the epa and contain certain disclosures on the product labels 
in addition  the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the epa 
our comet and spic and span products that make antibacterial and or disinfectant claims are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of any foreign jurisdictions in which these products are sold 
intellectual property we own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the united states  canada and other foreign countries 
the following are some of the most important registered trademarks we own in the united states and or canada chloraseptic  chore boy  clear eyes  cinch  cloverine  comet  compound w  freeze off  compoz  cutex  the doctor s brushpicks  denorex  dermoplast  essential care  freezone  kerodex  little remedies  longlast  momentum  mosco  murine  new skin  outgro  oxipor vhc  percogesic  prell  sleep eze  spic and span  wartner  vacuum grip and zincon 
in addition  we have exclusive royalty bearing licenses to use the ezo and earigate trademarks in the united states which expire on december  and november   respectively 
while we own the us trademark registration for kerodex  we have an obligation to pay royalties to unilever scientific with respect to the manufacture and sale of barrier creams sold in the united states under the kerodex trademark 
this royalty obligation will continue as long as we make  use or sell products utilizing the kerodex trademark in the united states 
our trademarks and trade names are how we convey that the products we sell are brand name products 
our ownership of these trademarks and trade names is very important to our business as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks 
we may also license others to use these marks 
additionally  we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology 
such patents evidence the unique nature of our products  provide us with exclusivity and afford us protection from the encroachment of others 
enforcing our rights represented by these trademarks  trade names and patents is critical to our business  but is expensive 
if we are not able to effectively enforce our rights  others may be able to dilute our trademarks  trade names and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other intellectual property rights were acquired from procter gamble and abbott laboratories when we acquired the trademarks related to the comet  chloraseptic  clear eyes  murine and prell product lines  however  we did not in all cases obtain title to all of the intellectual property used to manufacture and sell those products 
therefore  we are dependent upon procter gamble and other third parties for intellectual property used in the manufacture and sale of certain of our products 
we have licensed to procter gamble the right to use the comet  spic and span and chlorinol trademarks in the commercial institutional industrial segment in the united states and canada until we have also licensed to procter gamble the comet and chlorinol brands in russia and specified eastern european countries until seasonality the first quarter of our fiscal year typically has the lowest level of revenue due to the seasonal nature of certain of our brands relative to the summer and winter months 
in addition  the first quarter is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and promotional spending to support those brands with a summer selling season  such as compound w  wartner and new skin 
the increased level of advertising and promotional campaigns in the third quarter influence sales of chloraseptic products during the fourth quarter cough cold winter months 
additionally  the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and promotional spending as a percent of revenue

item a 
risk factors the high level of competition in our industry  much of which comes from competitors with greater resources  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the business of selling brand name consumer products in the over the counter healthcare  household cleaning and personal care categories is highly competitive 
these markets include numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers business both in the united states and abroad 
many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development  advertising and marketing  and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
if this were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
certain of our product lines that account for a large percentage of our sales have a small market share relative to our competitors 
for example  while clear eyes has a number two market share position of within the allergy redness eye drop segment  its top competitor  visine  has a market share of 
in contrast  certain of our brands with number two market positions have a similar market share relative to our competitors 
for example  compound w has a number two market position of and its top competitor  dr 
scholl s clear away and freeze away  have a market position of 
also  while cutex is the number one brand name nail polish remover with a market share of  non branded  private label nail polish removers account  in the aggregate  for of the market 
finally  while our new skin liquid bandage product has a number one market position of  the size of the liquid bandage market is relatively small  particularly when compared to the much larger bandage category 
see item business section on page of this document for information regarding market share calculations 
we compete for customers attention based on a number of factors  including brand recognition  product quality  performance  price and product availability at the retail level 
advertising  promotion  merchandising and packaging  the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on consumer buying decisions and  as a result  on our sales 
the structure and quality of our sales force  as well as sell through of our products affects in store position  wall display space and inventory levels in retail stores 
if we are unable to maintain the inventory levels and in store positioning of our products in retail stores  our sales and operating results will be adversely affected 
our markets also are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
an increase in the number of product innovations by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us 
competitive pricing may require us to reduce prices which may result in lost sales or a reduction of our profit margins 
future price adjustments  product changes or new product introductions by our competitors or our inability to react with price adjustments  product changes or new product introductions of our own could result in a loss of market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we depend on a limited number of customers with whom we have no long term agreements for a large portion of our gross sales and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce our gross sales and therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for  our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our sales  compared with approximately and and and during and  respectively 
wal mart  which itself accounted for approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively  is our only customer that accounted for or more of our sales 
we expect that for future periods  our top five and ten customers  including wal mart  will  in the aggregate  continue to account for a large portion of our sales 
the loss of one or more of our top customers  any significant decrease in sales to these customers  or a significant decrease in our retail display space in any of these customers stores  could reduce our sales  and therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders 
we typically do not enter into long term contracts with our customers 
accordingly  our customers could cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason 
the fact that we do not have long term contracts with our customers means that we have no recourse in the event a customer no longer wants to purchase products from us 
if a significant number of our smaller customers  or any of our significant customers  elect not to purchase products from us  our business  financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on third party manufacturers to produce the products we sell 
if we are unable to maintain these manufacturing relationships or fail to enter into additional relationships  as necessary  we may be unable to meet customer demand and our sales and profitability could suffer as a result 
all of our products are produced by third party manufacturers 
our ability to retain our current manufacturing relationships and engage in and successfully transition to new relationships is critical to our ability to deliver quality products to our customers in a timely manner 
without adequate supplies of quality merchandise  sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer 
in the event that our primary third party manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner  we would have to rely on secondary manufacturing relationships or identify and qualify new manufacturing relationships 
we might not be able to identify or qualify such manufacturers for existing or new products in a timely manner and such manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order that we may meet our commitments to customers 
in addition  identifying alternative manufacturers without adequate lead times can compromise required product validation and stability protocol  which may involve additional manufacturing expense  delay in production or product disadvantage in the marketplace 
the consequences of not securing adequate and timely supplies of merchandise would negatively impact inventory levels  sales and gross margins  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  even if our current manufacturers continue to manufacture our products  they may not maintain adequate quality controls  and therefore  may not be able to continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or applicable regulatory requirements 
if we are forced to rely on products of inferior quality  then our brand recognition and customer satisfaction would likely suffer  leading to a reduction in sales 
this sales reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
these manufacturers may also increase the cost of the products we purchase which could adversely affect our margins in the event we are unable to pass along these increased costs to our customers 
a situation such as this could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
at march   we had relationships with over third party manufacturers 
of those  our top manufacturers produced items that accounted for of our sales for we do not have long term contracts with the manufacturers of products that accounted for approximately of our sales for the fact that we do not have long term contracts with these manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing these products at any time and for any reason  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
disruption in our st 
louis distribution center may prevent us from meeting customer demand and our sales and profitability may suffer as a result 
we manage our product distribution in the continental united states through one primary distribution center in st 
louis  missouri 
a serious disruption  such as a flood or fire  to our primary distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost 
we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times during the time required to reopen or replace our primary distribution center 
as a result  any serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
achievement of our strategic objectives requires the acquisition  or potentially the disposition  of certain brands or product lines 
efforts to effect and integrate such acquisitions or dispositions may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations 
heretofore  the majority of our growth has been driven by acquiring other brands and companies 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions that are intended to enhance our product portfolio  enable us to realize cost savings and further diversify our category  customer and channel focus 
our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisition candidates and to obtain any necessary financing 
these efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties achieving  or an inability to achieve  our expected returns  difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage the business  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer or shareholder reaction to the acquisition 
in addition  an acquisition could adversely affect our operating results as a result of higher interest costs from the acquisition related debt and higher amortization expenses related to the acquired intangible assets 
the diversion of management s attention to pursue acquisitions  or our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in the event that we decide to sell a brand or product line  we may encounter difficulty finding  or be unable to find  a buyer on acceptable terms in a timely manner 
this could cause a delay in our efforts to achieve our strategic objectives 
our risks associated with doing business internationally increases as we expand our international footprint 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues were attributable to our international business 
we operate in several regions and countries where we have little or no experience  and generally rely on brokers and distributors for the sale of our products 
in addition to the risks associated with political instability  changes in the outlook for economic prosperity in these countries could adversely affect the sales of our products in these countries 
other risks of doing business internationally include changes in the legislative or regulatory requirements of the countries or regions where we do business  currency controls which restrict or prohibit the repatriation of earnings to the united states or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates resulting in unfavorable increases in the price of our products or cause increases in the cost of certain products purchased from our foreign third party manufacturers  regulatory oversight and its impact on our ability to get products registered for sale in certain markets  potential trade restrictions and exchange controls  inability to protect our intellectual property rights in these markets  and increased costs of compliance with general business and tax regulations in these countries or regions 
regulatory matters governing our industry could have a significant negative effect on our sales and operating costs 
in both our us and foreign markets  we are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints 
such laws  regulations and other constraints exist at the federal  state or local levels in the united states and at analogous levels of government in foreign jurisdictions 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including i the fda  ii the ftc  iii the cpsc  iv the epa  and by v various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed  stored and sold 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with those regulations  we could become subject to enforcement actions  significant penalties or claims  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or the cessation of product sales and may adversely affect the marketing of our products  resulting in a significant loss of revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the fdc act and fda regulations require that the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers must also comply with the fda s cgmps 
the fda inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine if we and our third party manufacturers are complying with cgmps 
a history of past compliance is not a guarantee that future cgmps will not mandate other compliance steps and associated expense 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with federal  state or foreign regulations  we could be required to suspend manufacturing operations  modify product formulations or processes  suspend the sale of products with non complying specifications  initiate product recalls  or change product labeling  packaging or advertising or take other corrective action 
any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  our failure to comply with ftc or any other federal and state regulations  or with similar regulations in foreign markets  that cover our product claims and advertising  including direct claims and advertising by us  may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise materially adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
product liability claims and related negative publicity could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
we may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by our products 
from time to time we have been and may again be subjected to various product liability claims 
claims could be based on allegations that  among other things  our products contain contaminants  include inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
for example  denorex products contain coal tar which the state of california has determined allegedly causes cancer 
consequently  in order to comply with california law and to mitigate our risks  the denorex packaging contains a warning to that effect 
any product liability claims may result in negative publicity that may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
also  if one of our products is found to be defective we may be required to recall it 
this may result in substantial costs and negative publicity which may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
although we maintain  and require our suppliers and third party manufacturers to maintain  product liability insurance coverage  potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or potential product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our ability to compete effectively in the market for our products could be negatively impacted 
the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks  trade names and patents 
our trademarks and trade names convey that the products we sell are brand name products 
we believe consumers ascribe value to our brands  some of which are over years old 
we own or license the material trademark  trade names and patents used in connection with the packaging  marketing and sale of our products 
these rights prevent our competitors or new entrants to the market from using our valuable brand names and technologies 
therefore  trademark  trade name and patent protection is critical to our business 
although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the united states and in applicable foreign countries  we may not be successful in asserting protection 
if we were to lose the exclusive right to use one or more of our intellectual property rights  the loss of such exclusive right could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace 
brand dilution or the introduction of competitive brands could cause confusion in the marketplace and adversely affect the value that consumers associate with our brands  and thereby negatively impact our sales 
any such infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources  financial or otherwise  to protect these rights through litigation or other means 
in addition  third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve those claims causing us to lose our ability to use our intellectual property that is the subject of those claims 
such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
furthermore  from time to time  we may be involved in litigation in which we are enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights which could require us to incur substantial fees and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
virtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles 
as our financial statements indicate  virtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles  principally the trademarks  trade names and patents that we have acquired 
in the event that the value of those assets became impaired or our business is materially adversely affected in any way  we would not have tangible assets that could be sold to repay our liabilities 
as a result  our creditors and investors may not be able to recoup the amount of the indebtedness that they have extended to us or the amount they have invested in us 
we depend on third parties for intellectual property relating to some of the products we sell  and our inability to maintain or enter into future license agreements may result in our failure to meet customer demand  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have licenses or manufacturing agreements with third parties that own intellectual property eg  formulae  copyrights  trademarks  trade dress  patents and other technology used in the manufacture and sale of certain of our products 
in the event that any such license or manufacturing agreement expires or is otherwise terminated  we will lose the right to use the intellectual property covered by such license or agreement and will have to develop or obtain rights to use other intellectual property 
similarly  our rights could be reduced if the applicable licensor or third party manufacturer fails to maintain the licensed intellectual property because  in such event  our competitors could obtain the right to use the intellectual property without restriction 
if this were to occur  we might not be able to develop or obtain replacement intellectual property in a timely manner 
additionally  any modified products may not be well received by customers 
the consequences of losing the right to use or having reduced rights to such intellectual property could negatively impact our sales due to our failure to meet consumer demand for the affected products or require us to incur costs for development of new or different intellectual property  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  development of replacement products may be time consuming and ultimately may not be feasible 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
we may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify  hire and integrate new personnel 
while we believe we have developed depth and experience among our key personnel  our business may be adversely affected if one or more of these key individuals were to leave 
we do not maintain any key man or similar insurance policies covering any of our senior management or key personnel 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and the significant amount of cash we need to service our debt will not be available to reinvest in our business 
at march   our total indebtedness  including current maturities  is approximately million 
additionally  we have the ability to borrow up to million pursuant to our senior credit facility and million pursuant to our revolving credit facility 
however  our substantial indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations toward repayment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior credit facility allow us to issue and incur additional debt upon satisfaction of conditions set forth in the respective agreements 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the related risks described above could increase 
our operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose restrictions that could impede our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions  as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things borrow money or issue guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase stock from or make other restricted payments to stockholders  make investments or acquisitions  use assets as security in other transactions  sell assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell stock in our subsidiaries  and direct our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to our company 
our ability to engage in these types of transactions is generally limited by the terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  even if we believe that a specific transaction would positively contribute to our future growth  operating results or profitability 
however  if we are able to enter into these types of transactions under the terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture  or if we obtain a waiver with respect to any specific transaction  that transaction may cause our indebtedness to increase  may not result in the benefits we anticipate or may cause us to incur greater costs or suffer greater disruptions in our business than we anticipate  and could therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the senior credit facility requires us to maintain certain leverage  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
although we believe we can continue to meet and or maintain the financial ratios contained in our credit agreement  our ability to do so may be affected by events outside our control 
covenants in our senior credit facility also require us to use of the proceeds we receive from debt issuances to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 
any failure by us to comply with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain cross default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain provisions that allow the respective creditors to declare all outstanding borrowings under one agreement to be immediately due and payable as a result of a default under the other agreement 
consequently  under the senior credit facility  failure to make a payment required by the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  among other things  may lead to an event of default under the senior credit facility 
similarly  an event of default or failure to make a required payment at maturity under the senior credit facility  among other things  may lead to an event of default under the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes 
if the debt under the senior credit facility and indenture governing the senior subordinated notes were to both be accelerated  the aggregate amount immediately due and payable as of march  would have been approximately million 
we presently do not have sufficient liquidity to repay these borrowings in the event they were to be accelerated  and we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to do so 
additionally  we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance the indebtedness 
at march   the book value of our current assets was million 
although the book value of our total assets was  million  approximately million was in the form of intangible assets  including goodwill of million  a significant portion of which is illiquid and may not be available to satisfy our creditors in the event our debt is accelerated 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of the senior credit facility  the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default 
such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt  as well as any other debt to which the cross acceleration or cross default provisions apply 
in addition  the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with additional funding 
as a result  any default by us under our credit agreement  indenture governing the senior subordinated notes or any other financing agreement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees  consumers  suppliers  stockholders or others through private actions  class actions  administrative proceedings  regulatory actions or other litigation 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions  is difficult to assess or quantify 
plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts  and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant 
there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our products  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 
conversely  we may be required to initiate litigation against others to protect the value of our intellectual property and the goodwill associated therewith 
these matters are extremely time consuming and expensive  but absolutely necessary to maintain enterprise value and safeguard our future 
as a result  litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including i general stock market volatility  ii variations in our quarterly operating results  iii our leveraged financial position  iv potential sales of additional shares of our common stock  v general trends in the consumer products industry  vi changes by securities analysts in their estimates or investment ratings  vii the relative illiquidity of our common stock  viii voluntary withdrawal or recall of products and ix news regarding litigation in which we are or become involved 
our principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence our business  which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
entities affiliated with gtcr collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions 
subject to applicable law  under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  the gtcr entities and non employee directors will not have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do 
in the event that any gtcr entity or non employee director  as the case may be  acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and us  the gtcr entity or non employee director  as the case may be  will not have any duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us and may pursue such corporate opportunity for itself or direct such corporate opportunity to another person 
this concentration of stock ownership also may make it difficult for stockholders to replace management 
in addition  this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with stockholders who own significant blocks of stock 
this concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of our officers  directors and principal stockholders and the trading price of shares of our common stock could be adversely affected 
substantial sales of our common stock by either gtcr or management or the perception that these sales could occur could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by the affiliates of gtcr or management  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
pursuant to an agreement with gtcr  we filed a registration statement on form s form s with the sec in december we expect the form s to be declared effective by the sec in the near future and  once effective  gtcr will have the ability to sell common stock  up to the maximum number of common shares registered  into the public marketplace 
such a sale could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  at the request of gtcr  we intend to request of the sec that it declare the form s effective as soon as possible 
we have no current intention of paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
we presently intend to retain our earnings  if any  for use in our operations  to facilitate strategic acquisitions  or to repay our outstanding indebtedness and have no current intention of paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
in addition  our debt instruments limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock 
as a result  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit 
our annual and quarterly results from operations may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  resulting in a decline in the price of our securities 
our annual and quarterly results from operations may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including increases and decreases in average quarterly revenues and profitability  the rate at which we make acquisitions or develop new products and successfully market them  our inability to increase the sales of our existing products and expand their distribution  adverse regulatory or market events in our international markets  litigation matters  changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions  including the effects of competitors operational  promotional or expansion activities  seasonality of our products  fluctuations in commodity prices  product costs  utilities and energy costs  prevailing wage rates  insurance costs and other costs  our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  and the costs associated with those activities  changes in advertising and promotional activities and expansion to new markets  negative publicity relating to us and the products we sell  unanticipated increases in infrastructure costs  impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  changes in interest rates  and changes in accounting  tax  regulatory or other rules applicable to our business 
our quarterly operating results and revenues may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and revenues for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted 
we can be affected adversely and unexpectedly by the implementation of new  or changes in the interpretation of existing  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our financial reporting complies with gaap  and gaap is subject to change over time 
if new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting  our financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected 
identification of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting may adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
those provisions provide for the identification and reporting of material weaknesses in our system of internal controls over financial reporting 
if such a material weakness is identified  it could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements 
we routinely assess our internal controls over financial reporting  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage potential acquirers of our company  which could adversely affect the value of our securities 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time  without further stockholder approval  up to million shares of preferred stock in one or more series of preferred stock issuances 
our board of directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each series of preferred stock and determine  as applicable  the voting and other powers  designations  preferences  rights  qualifications  limitations and restrictions for such series of preferred stock 
the shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
we may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of the company without further action by our stockholders 
the shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights  and by the creation of class or series voting rights 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains additional provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of our company 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions of delaware law that limit  in some cases  our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant stockholders 
these provisions  either alone  or in combination with each other  give our current directors and executive officers the ability to significantly influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the company 
these provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
if a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions  the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted

item legal proceedings securities class action litigation the company and certain of its officers and directors are defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the consolidated action 
the first of the six consolidated cases was filed on august  plaintiffs purport to represent a class of stockholders of the company who purchased shares between february  through november  plaintiffs also name as defendants the underwriters in the company s initial public offering and a private equity fund that was a selling stockholder in the offering 
the district court has appointed a lead plaintiff 
on december   the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint  which asserted claims under sections  a and of the securities act of and sections b  a and a of the securities exchange act of the lead plaintiff generally alleged that the company issued a series of materially false and misleading statements in connection with its initial public offering and thereafter in regard to the following areas the accounting issues described in the company s press release issued on or about november   and the alleged failure to disclose that demand for certain of the company s products was declining and that the company was planning to withdraw several products from the market 
plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages 
the company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint in february on july   the court dismissed all claims against the company and the individual defendants arising under the securities exchange act of on june   a hearing before the court was held regarding plaintiffs pending motion for class certification in the consolidated action 
on september   the united states district court for the southern district of new york issued an order certifying a class consisting of all persons who purchased the common stock of the company pursuant to  or traceable to  the company s initial public offering on or about february  through november  and were damaged thereby 
on january   the parties to the action engaged in mediation to explore the terms of a potential settlement of the pending litigation  however  no settlement agreement was reached during mediation 
a status conference was held on february  and another status conference is scheduled to be held on july  while discovery in the action has commenced and is continuing  the company s management continues to believe that the remaining claims in the case are legally deficient and that it has meritorious defenses to the claims that remain 
the company intends to vigorously defend against the claims remaining in the case  however  the company cannot  at this time  reasonably estimate the potential range of loss  if any 
orasure technologies arbitration on september   orasure technologies  inc orasure moved in the supreme court of the state of new york for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the company from selling cryogenic wart removal products under the wartner brand  which the company acquired on september  orasure was a supplier to the company for the company s compound w freeze off business 
the distribution agreement between the parties provides for mediation of contract disputes  followed by arbitration  if necessary 
the contract in question had a term ending in december on october   the court denied orasure s motion for a preliminary injunction 
subsequently  in a decision and order dated december   the court denied a motion by orasure for a rehearing regarding a preliminary injunction 
an appeal was filed by orasure in the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of new york on january   and the company filed a brief with the court on february  on may   the appellate division reversed the decision of the supreme court of the state of new york and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the marketing and selling of the wartner brand by the company until the underlying arbitration with orasure was concluded 
on may   the company requested that the appellate division issue a stay of the preliminary injunction  consider reargument of the appellate division s decision and grant a leave to appeal to the court of appeals of the state of new york 
in response to the company s request for a stay of the preliminary injunction  the appellate division issued a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the appellate division s consideration of the company s motion to reargue and request for leave to appeal to the court of appeals 
on july   the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of new york issued an order affirming the order of the supreme court of the state of new york which denied orasure s petition for a preliminary injunction that would have prohibited the company from selling cryogenic wart removal products under the wartner brand 
in addition  the appellate division dismissed orasure s appeal from the supreme court s order which denied orasure s motion for reargument 
based on the foregoing  the appellate division held that a preliminary injunction was not an appropriate remedy in the action and recalled and vacated its order dated may   which granted a preliminary injunction 
at the end of august  the company and orasure participated in an arbitration hearing at which each party presented its case to the arbitration panel 
on october   the company received notification from the arbitrators that they had issued a partial final award the award in the pending arbitration with orasure 
the arbitrators acknowledged that there was a technical breach of the non compete clause in the distribution agreement between the parties but orasure s proof of damages was speculative and not supported by credible evidence 
therefore  the arbitrators awarded nominal damages to orasure in the amount of one dollar 
in addition  the arbitrators awarded to orasure counsel fees and arbitrator compensation in an amount to be determined pursuant to further proceedings 
the arbitration panel also dismissed with prejudice orasure s remaining claims for breach of the distribution agreement  orasure s request for injunctive relief and the company s counterclaims  respectively 
furthermore  the arbitrators confirmed the company s position that the distribution agreement will terminate on december  on december   the arbitration panel concluded the arbitration by issuing a final award for certain counsel fees and arbitrator compensation to be paid by the company 
pursuant to the final award  the company has made payment to orasure in an amount that did not have a material impact on the company s results from operations for the year ended march  dentek litigation in april  the company filed a lawsuit in the us district court in the southern district of new york against dentek oral care  inc dentek alleging i infringement of intellectual property associated with the doctor s nightguard dental protector which is used for the protection of teeth from nighttime teeth grinding  and ii the violation of unfair competition and consumer protection laws 
on october   the company filed a second amended complaint in which it named kelly m 
kaplan  raymond duane and cds associates  inc as additional defendants in the action against dentek and added other claims to the previously filed complaint 
ms 
kaplan and mr 
duane were formerly employed by the company and cds associates  inc is a corporation controlled by mr 
duane 
in the second amended complaint  the company has alleged patent  trademark and copyright infringement  unfair competition  unjust enrichment  violation of new york s consumer protection act  breach of contract  tortuous interference with contractual and business relations  civil conspiracy and trade secret misappropriation 
on october   the company filed a motion for preliminary injunction with the court in which the company has asked the court to enjoin the defendants from i continuing to improperly use the company s trade secrets  ii continuing to breach any contractual agreements with the company  and iii marketing and selling any dental protector products or other products in which ray duane or kelly kaplan has had any involvement or provided any assistance to dentek 
a hearing date for the motion for preliminary injunction has not yet been set by the court 
discovery requests have been served by the parties and discovery is ongoing 
in november  the defendants in the action each filed a motion to dismiss which is pending before the court 
the company has filed responses to the motions to dismiss and is awaiting a decision by the court regarding such motions 
the court has ordered the company s motion for a preliminary injunction to be held in abeyance pending a determination of the motions to dismiss 
a hearing before the court was held on february  regarding pending procedural motions and discovery and another hearing is scheduled to be held on june  regarding such motions and ongoing discovery 
the parties are also scheduled to appear in court on july  for a status conference 
in addition to the matters described above  the company is involved from time to time in other routine legal matters and other claims incidental to its business 
the company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess probability and amount of potential loss 
these assessments are re evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
the company believes the resolution of routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results from operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that involve certain risks  assumptions and uncertainties 
future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons  including the factors described in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k  as well as those described in future reports filed with the sec 
general we are engaged in the marketing  sales and distribution of brand name over the counter healthcare  household cleaning and personal care products to mass merchandisers  drug stores  supermarkets and club stores primarily in the united states and canada 
we operate in niche segments of these categories where we can use the strength of our brands  our established retail distribution network  a low cost operating model and our experienced management team as a competitive advantage to grow our presence in these categories and  as a result  grow our sales and profits 
we have grown our brand portfolio by acquiring strong and well recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies  as well as other brands from smaller private companies 
while the brands we have purchased from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies have long histories of support and brand development  we believe that at the time we acquired them they were considered non core by their previous owners and did not benefit from the focus of senior level management or strong marketing support 
we believe that the brands we have purchased from smaller private companies have been constrained by the limited resources of their prior owners 
after acquiring a brand  we seek to increase its sales  market share and distribution in both existing and new channels 
we pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotion  new marketing strategies  improved packaging and formulations and innovative new products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all significant accounting policies are important to our consolidated financial statements  certain of these policies may be viewed as being critical 
such policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results from operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses or the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different conditions 
the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we comply with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we have determined that the transfer of risk of loss generally occurs when product is received by the customer  and  accordingly recognize revenue at that time 
provision is made for estimated discounts related to customer payment terms and estimated product returns at the time of sale based on our historical experience 
as is customary in the consumer products industry  we participate in the promotional programs of our customers to enhance the sale of our products 
the cost of these promotional programs is recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products as either advertising and promotional expenses or as a reduction of sales 
such costs vary from period to period based on the actual number of units sold during a finite period of time 
we estimate the cost of such promotional programs at their inception based on historical experience and current market conditions and reduce sales by such estimates 
these promotional programs consist of direct to consumer incentives such as coupons and temporary price reductions  as well as incentives to our customers  such as slotting fees and cooperative advertising 
we do not provide incentives to customers for the acquisition of product in excess of normal inventory quantities since such incentives increase the potential for future returns  as well as reduce sales in the subsequent fiscal periods 
estimates of costs of promotional programs are based on i historical sales experience  ii the current offering  iii forecasted data  iv current market conditions  and v communication with customer purchasing marketing personnel 
at the completion of the promotional program  the estimated amounts are adjusted to actual results 
while our promotional expense for the year ended march  was million  we participated in  promotional campaigns  resulting in an average cost of  per campaign 
of such amount  only payments were in excess of  we believe that the estimation methodologies employed  combined with the nature of the promotional campaigns  makes the likelihood remote that our obligation would be misstated by a material amount 
however  for illustrative purposes  had we underestimated the promotional program rate by for the year ended march   our sales and operating income would have been adversely affected by approximately million 
net income would have been adversely affected by approximately million 
we also periodically run coupon programs in sunday newspaper inserts or as on package instant redeemable coupons 
we utilize a national clearing house to process coupons redeemed by customers 
at the time a coupon is distributed  a provision is made based upon historical redemption rates for that particular product  information provided as a result of the clearing house s experience with coupons of similar dollar value  the length of time the coupon is valid  and the seasonality of the coupon drop  among other factors 
during  we had coupon events 
the amount recorded against revenues and accrued for these events during the year was million  of which million was redeemed during the year 
allowances for product returns due to the nature of the consumer products industry  we are required to estimate future product returns 
accordingly  we record an estimate of product returns concurrent with the recording of sales 
such estimates are made after analyzing i historical return rates  ii current economic trends  iii changes in customer demand  iv product acceptance  v seasonality of our product offerings  and vi the impact of changes in product formulation  packaging and advertising 
we construct our returns analysis by looking at the previous year s return history for each brand 
subsequently  each month  we estimate our current return rate based upon an average of the previous six months return rate and review that calculated rate for reasonableness giving consideration to the other factors described above 
our historical return rate has been relatively stable  for example  for the years ended march   and  returns represented  and  respectively  of gross sales 
while the returns rate increased from to  such amount exclusive of the voluntary withdrawal from the marketplace of little remedies medicated pediatric cough and cold products in october  would have been 
at march  and  the allowance for sales returns was million and million  respectively 
while we utilize the methodology described above to estimate product returns  actual results may differ materially from our estimates  causing our future financial results to be adversely affected 
among the factors that could cause a material change in the estimated return rate would be significant unexpected returns with respect to a product or products that comprise a significant portion of our revenues in a manner similar to the little remedies voluntary withdrawal discussed above 
based upon the methodology described above and our actual returns experience  management believes the likelihood of such an event remains remote 
as noted  over the last three years  our actual product return rate has stayed within a range of to of gross sales 
an increase of in our estimated return rate as a percentage of gross sales would have adversely affected our reported sales and operating income for the year ended march  by approximately  net income would have been adversely affected by approximately  allowances for obsolete and damaged inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
accordingly  we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
many of our products are subject to expiration dating 
as a general rule our customers will not accept goods with expiration dating of less than months from the date of delivery 
to monitor this risk  management utilizes a detailed compilation of inventory with expiration dating between zero and months and reserves for of the cost of any item with expiration dating of months or less 
at march  and  the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory represented and  respectively  of total inventory 
the year over year decrease resulted primarily from the disposition of cough and cold products that had been included in the obsolescence reserve at march  due to short dating  partially offset by the addition of the little remedies products that were subject to the voluntary withdrawal from the marketplace of little remedies medicated pediatric cough and cold products in october inventory obsolescence costs charged to operations for   and were million  million and  respectively  or and  respectively  of net sales 
a increase in our allowance for obsolescence at march  would have adversely affected our reported operating income and net income for the year ended march  by approximately  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which is based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of the accounts receivable 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we establish specific reserves for those accounts which file for bankruptcy  have no payment activity for days or have reported major negative changes to their financial condition 
the allowance for bad debts amounted to of accounts receivable at both march  and bad debt expense recoveries for  and were   and  respectively  each representing of net sales in each of the years 
while management believes that it is diligent in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  an unexpected event  such as the bankruptcy filing of a major customer  could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
a increase in our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales in would have resulted in a decrease in reported operating income of approximately  and a decrease in our reported net income of approximately  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million and million at march  and  respectively 
at march   goodwill and intangible assets were apportioned among our three operating segments as follows over the counter healthcare household cleaning personal care consolidated goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived our clear eyes  new skin  chloraseptic  compound w and wartner brands comprise the majority of the value of the intangible assets within the over the counter healthcare segment 
the comet  spic and span and chore boy brands comprise substantially all of the intangible asset value within the household cleaning segment 
denorex  cutex and prell comprised substantially all of the intangible asset value within the personal care segment 
goodwill and intangible assets comprise substantially all of our assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
intangible assets generally represent our trademarks  brand names and patents 
when we acquire a brand  we are required to make judgments regarding the value assigned to the associated intangible assets  as well as their respective useful lives 
management considers many factors  both prior to and after  the acquisition of an intangible asset in determining the value  as well as the useful life  assigned to each intangible asset that the company acquires or continues to own and promote 
the most significant factors are brand history a brand that has been in existence for a long period of time eg   or years generally warrants a higher valuation and longer life sometimes indefinite than a brand that has been in existence for a very short period of time 
a brand that has been in existence for an extended period of time generally has been the subject of considerable investment by its previous owner s to support product innovation and advertising and promotion 
market position consumer products that rank number one or two in their respective market generally have greater name recognition and are known as quality product offerings  which warrant a higher valuation and longer life than products that lag in the marketplace 
recent and projected sales growth recent sales results present a snapshot as to how the brand has performed in the most recent time periods and represent another factor in the determination of brand value 
in addition  projected sales growth provides information about the strength and potential longevity of the brand 
a brand that has both strong current and projected sales generally warrants a higher valuation and a longer life than a brand that has weak or declining sales 
similarly  consideration is given to the potential investment  in the form of advertising and promotion  which is required to reinvigorate a brand that has fallen from favor 
history of and potential for product extensions consideration also is given to the product innovation that has occurred during the brand s history and the potential for continued product innovation that will determine the brand s future 
brands that can be continually enhanced by new product offerings generally warrant a higher valuation and longer life than a brand that has always followed the leader 
after consideration of the factors described above  as well as current economic conditions and changing consumer behavior  management prepares a determination of the intangible s value and useful life based on its analysis of the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 business combinations and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement no 

under statement no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but must be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and must also be tested for impairment 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered  management performs a review of both the values and useful lives assigned to goodwill and intangible assets and tests for impairment 
finite lived intangible assets as mentioned above  management performs an annual review  or more frequently if necessary  to ascertain the impact of events and circumstances on the estimated useful lives and carrying values of our trademarks and trade names 
in connection with this analysis  management reviews period to period sales and profitability by brand  analyzes industry trends and projects brand growth rates  prepares annual sales forecasts  evaluates advertising effectiveness  analyzes gross margins  reviews contractual benefits or limitations  monitors competitors advertising spend and product innovation  prepares projections to measure brand viability over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  and considers the regulatory environment  as well as industry litigation 
should analysis of any of the aforementioned factors warrant a change in the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  management will reduce the estimated useful life and amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life 
management s projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts  circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life 
in the event that the long term projections indicate that the carrying value is in excess of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible assets  management is required to record an impairment charge 
once that analysis is completed  a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value 
the impairment charge is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over fair value as calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis 
future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
indefinite lived intangible assets in a manner similar to finite lived intangible assets  on an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary  management analyzes current events and circumstances to determine whether the indefinite life classification for a trademark or trade name continues to be valid 
should circumstance warrant a finite life  the carrying value of the intangible asset would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life 
in connection with this analysis  management also tests the indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for trademarks and trade names such as ours  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
accordingly  management s projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts  circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life 
in performing this analysis  management considers the same types of information as listed above in regards to finite lived intangible assets 
once that analysis is completed  a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value 
future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
goodwill as part of its annual test for impairment of goodwill  management estimates the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit  which is at the brand level  and one level below the operating segment level  to estimate their respective fair values 
in performing this analysis  management considers the same types of information as listed above in regards to finite lived intangible assets 
in the event that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  management would then be required to allocate the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the unit was acquired in a business combination  thereby revaluing the carrying amount of goodwill 
in a manner similar to indefinite lived assets  future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
in estimating the value of trademarks and trade names  as well as goodwill  at march   management applied a discount rate of  the company s then current weighted average cost of funds  to the estimated cash flows  however that rate  as well as future cash flows may be influenced by such factors  including i changes in interest rates  ii rates of inflation  or iii sales or contribution margin reductions 
in the event that the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of either intangible assets or goodwill  we would be required to recognize an impairment charge 
additionally  continued decline of the fair value ascribed to an intangible asset or a reporting unit caused by external factors may require future impairment charges 
during the three month period ended march   we recorded non cash charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill of the personal care segment of million and million  respectively  because the carrying amounts of these branded assets exceeded their fair market values primarily as a result of declining sales caused by product competition 
should the related fair values of goodwill and intangible assets continue to be adversely affected as a result of declining sales or margins caused by competition  technological advances or reductions in advertising and promotional expenses  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges 
however  we were not required to record any asset impairment charges during or stock based compensation during  we adopted fasb statement no

statement no 
r requires us to measure the cost of services to be rendered based on the grant date fair value of the equity award 
compensation expense is to be recognized over the period which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally referred to as the requisite service period 
information utilized in the determination of fair value includes the following type of instrument ie restricted shares vs 
an option  warrant or performance shares  strike price of the instrument  market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant  discount rates  duration of the instrument  and volatility of the company s common stock in the public market 
additionally  management must estimate the expected attrition rate of the recipients to enable it to estimate the amount of non cash compensation expense to be recorded in our financial statements 
while management uses diligent analysis to estimate the respective variables  a change in assumptions or market conditions  as well as changes in the anticipated attrition rates  could have a significant impact on the future amounts recorded as non cash compensation expense 
the company recorded net non cash compensation expense of million   and  during  and  respectively 
however  in  management was required to reverse previously recorded stock based compensation costs of   and  related to the october  july and may grants  respectively  as it determined that the company would not meet the performance goals associated with such grants of restricted stock 
assuming no changes in assumptions and no new awards authorized by the compensation committee of the board of directors  we will record non cash compensation expense of approximately million during loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent losses are often resolved over longer periods of time and involve many factors including rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies  sufficiency of the evidence in support of our position  anticipated costs to support our position  and likelihood of a positive outcome

interest rate changes  therefore  generally do not affect the market value of such debt  but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant
