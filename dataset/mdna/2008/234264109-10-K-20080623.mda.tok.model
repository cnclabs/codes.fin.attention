item business general development of business company background and overview 
daktronics  inc was founded by dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander in while they were professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota 
our long and close relationship with sdsu and other south dakota colleges and universities is a key factor contributing to our leadership in the industry 
we have been able to experience sustained growth due in part to the capability of the local universities and colleges to provide an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
over the years  our products have evolved significantly  from scoreboards and matrix displays and related software applications to complex  integrated visual display systems that include full color video  text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network and tied together through sophisticated control systems 
in the mid nineties  as light emitting diodes led s became available in red  blue and green colors with outdoor brightness  we pioneered the development of full color led video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors  thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color  brightness  energy efficiency and lifetime 
due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems  in which we were already a leader  we were able to add video capabilities so all of a customer s large format display needs could be met in a complete  integrated system 
this has proven to be a key factor in daktronics becoming the dominant company worldwide in large electronic displays 
over the years  we have invested in product development to add complementary products and services  such as production services  sound systems  marketing services  maintenance and support and other products for our customers 
business developments 
as a result of our line of led display systems and software applications  we gained significant market share through designing and manufacturing quality products and providing technical expertise and services 
our products are in use throughout the world  as we are the world s leader in all led display product categories  according to independent research 
in the sports market  our integrated video and scoring systems have been installed at many professional  collegiate and high schools facilities  particularly in north america  and at international sporting events such as the olympic games 
with commercial applications  our video  digital billboard and graphics displays can be seen in major destination sites  such as las vegas and times square  along roadsides at retail establishments and at many other locations 
in the transportation market  our vanguard displays are in use in numerous jurisdictions across north america and our customers include many state departments of transportation 
one of our core growth strategies has been to enter geographic markets by developing a small sales and service presence that provides after sale support to our entire product line and sales of our products 
this network of offices  including home offices  has historically been and is expected to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy 
we currently have approximately corporate offices throughout the world 
we occasionally acquire businesses that provide access to new markets or complement our existing products 
in the past five years  we have acquired a number of small companies 
although these acquisitions increased the scope of services and technology that we are able to provide  our primary growth objective is still the increase of sales through organic growth 
financial information about segments see note of the consolidated financial statements for financial information pertaining to our business segments and geographic operations 
narrative description of business we are the world s leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems and related marketing services  digital messaging solutions  software and services for sports venues  commercial and transportation applications 
our continuing focus is on supporting customers with superior products  integration and services that provide dynamic  reliable and unique visual communication solutions 
we offer a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large multi million dollar video display systems as well as related control  timing  sound and hoist systems and related professional services 
we are recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems that display real time data  graphics  animation and video 
we are engaged in a full range of activities marketing and sales  engineering and design  manufacturing and professional services 
each of those activities is described below 
marketing and sales 
our products have been sold throughout the united states and other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and resellers 
in the united states and canada  we use primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and smaller sports facilities  including high schools and transportation applications 
in smaller commercial applications  we rely primarily on resellers 
we also utilize resellers outside north america on large video system projects where we do not have a direct sales presence 
sales to resellers generally have terms equal to sales directly to end users 
the majority of the products sold by resellers are standard catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
we support our resellers through direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and our sales force support in the field 
we believe that we can expand sales and in some niches  market share  by expanding both our direct sales force and resellers 
our direct sales force is comprised of a network of offices located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as described above  the direct sales staff sells the entire range of our standard products and substantially all of the large video display systems 
our direct sales staff is structured in a way to maximize cross selling opportunities across segments 
we have organized our business into five business units which have a primary focus on particular markets and a secondary focus on opportunities in other markets 
the business units consist of four domestic business units that include us and canada commercial  live events  schools and theatres  and transportation and a fifth business unit for international operations 
we believe that customers in each area are unique in a number of ways which are conducive to this structure 
for example  live events customers usually have a large variety of products tied into a system in a single location that involves much more creative production services  design and event support 
the commercial business unit relies more on needs created by large and remote networks of displays connected through various modes of communication 
the transportation business unit focuses on the unique needs of governmental contractors and ties into integrated systems that manage the flow of travelers and vehicles 
finally  the schools and theatre business unit focuses on the increasing level of support and service and limited resources along with all the statistics and related software and communication needs of athletic conferences and leagues 
when we target a potential customer for sales opportunities  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently  on larger sales opportunities  engineers  technicians and sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and assemble and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
we also regularly host customers at our various manufacturing facilities to demonstrate product quality  manufacturing  and design capabilities 
international sales fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit or partial payment in advance 
we believe that in addition to the growth we expect domestically  we will also achieve growth in the international markets 
during fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
since  we have acquired or opened international offices in canada  china  france  the united arab emirates  germany  australia and the united kingdom 
we also are a owner of a joint venture in malaysia 
much of our marketing and sales success in the past was based on our ability to create new products and product enhancements for customers by understandingtheir needs and opportunities 
we have developed and continue to develop this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and other personnel and through attendance at trade shows  conventions and seminars and fostering a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
engineering and product development 
the large screen electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  we must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry 
we will continue our tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to help achieve more effective product development by investing approximately of our net sales into product design and development 
we employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design  applications engineering  software design and customer and product support 
we use primarily in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
we assign product managers from our engineering staff to each product or product family to assist our sales staff in training  implement product improvements  and ensure that each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
we also invest in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
our engineering staff consists of four product development groups sports  video  commercial and transportation 
the sports product development group focus is aligned with the schools and theatre business unit  the video group is aligned with the live events and international business units and the commercial and transportation groups are aligned with the commercial and transportation business units 
until fiscal year  each engineering group was autonomous to allow it to focus on one product family 
beginning in fiscal year  we implemented a more matrix based organization with key leaders of each engineering group being responsible for design initiatives across all groups 
this allows us to take advantage of core technologies that can be used across product categories 
we believe that this is a core strategy to drive the highest quality and most reliable products 
manufacturing 
as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  we perform most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of our products 
our manufacturing operations include component manufacturing and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
we augment our production capacity with the use of outside resources primarily due to capacity constraints  although we have also used outside providers when it was more cost effective 
we use a modular approach for manufacturing displays 
standard product modules are designed to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
we inventory a limited supply of standard products 
custom projects are built according to the customer s specifications 
product modules are designed so that a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
a key strategy of ours is to reduce the need for customization of displays and increase standardization 
for example  we are developing a more widespread use of a common module platform and are expanding use of a standard formed cabinet for displays 
our order entry  production  customer service and many other functions are also consolidated through an enterprise resource planning system to facilitate communication among employee teams throughout the entire sales  design  production and delivery process 
during fiscal year  we began significant expansion of our facilities and throughput to respond to the increasing level of sales 
prior to that time  substantially all of our products were manufactured in our main facility in brookings  south dakota 
during fiscal year  we began manufacturing in sioux falls  south dakota and redwood falls  minnesota 
we also deployed a limited amount of manufacturing in china and expect to expand that location in the upcoming fiscal year 
locations outside of brookings now produce a material amount of our products 
during fiscal year  we began reorganizing our plants to more closely align them with the five business units described above 
in the fourth quarter and fiscal year  we deepened this reorganization by allocating inventory and decentralizing various other functions to each plant 
this resulted in significant investment in replicating processes which in prior years were centralized 
this was extremely important given the rapid growth of the business and the resulting unique needs of our customers in each business unit 
our goal is to align sales  marketing  engineering and manufacturing into a cohesive business unit with a focus on customers while not giving up the synergies of shared resources 
in addition  given the cyclical nature of some parts of our business  we need to maintain our ability to manufacture the same products across our plants so that we can smooth out the peaks and valleys of customer demand of the various business units 
technical contracting 
we serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations that require custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of standard displays and other state of the art display systems typically involves competitive proposals 
as a part of our response to a proposal request  we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in the optimal type of display system 
we usually include  as a part of our proposal  site preparation and installation services related to the display system 
in these cases  we serve as a contractor and may retain subcontractors 
we are licensed in a number of domestic jurisdictions as a general contractor 
generally  we outsource all related electrical  steel and installation labor to qualified subcontractors with which we have developed relationships 
professional services 
our professional services are essential to continued market penetration and growth 
we provide maintenance and support services and technical contracting in all of our offices throughout the world 
we are currently evaluating our office network in the us to ensure that the organization is functioning efficiently from a cost perspective 
this includes reevaluating the need for offices in certain locations  our current approach to parts logistics and various other matters 
we supplement our offices with a network of authorized service companies for service and maintenance needs 
professional services we provide in addition to technical contracting include event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance  training on hardware and software  and display rentals 
our creative production staff provides a variety of services to customers  including video content  event support  control room design  on site training hardware and software  and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
our sports marketing division provides customers with marketing and ad sales for facilities to fund display system purchases 
these marketing services extend beyond the marketing potential of the equipment in the facility to other facility related components 
typically  we render these services to facilities that do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
customer service and support 
our customer service distinguishes us from our competitors 
this service includes limited warranties for most of our products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after the first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer and extended service agreements 
we also provide help desk access  parts repair and replacement and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
we staff our help desk with experienced technicians who are available on call hours a day to support events and sites 
our repair center is staffed with trained technicians who repair and return components that require service  and we offer a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
beginning in fiscal  we reorganized our north american field service personnel so that we could better focus on the commonality of the products across units rather than the unique customer needs  which was the prior focus 
we believe that we can drive significant cost savings and synergies by doing this that will become visible as we enter into the second half of the fiscal year 
general description of our products and technologies our display technologies have changed significantly since the mid s when incandescent lamps were the primary display element 
presently  led and liquid crystal display lcd technologies are the primary display elements 
the invention and availability of the blue and green led in the mid s  along with the already available red led  allowed the introduction of full color video displays using leds as the primary colors to form all other colors in the video display 
the decreasing costs of lcd components along with the drive for more numerous smaller displays have led to the addition of lcd displays 
driven by customer demand  we have enhanced our video display technology into mobile and modular technologies and high definition capabilities for various applications 
the cost  performance and availability of leds has made them the preferred display element for large displays as compared to alternatives such as incandescent and reflective technologies  most of which are obsolete or unproven 
the cost effectiveness  life and performance of lcds have made them the preferred small display solution 
the vast majority of displays we sell today utilize led technology 
the two principal components of many of our systems are the display and the controller 
the controller uses computer hardware and software to process the information provided by the operator and other integrated sources and then compiles the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the display 
data can be transferred between the controller and local or remote displays 
local connections may use wire cables  fiber optic cables  infrared links or radio links 
standard and cellular telephone connections and satellite transmissions are used to connect to remote displays 
the controller controls each of the pixels which are the dots or picture elements that make up the image on the display to present the message or image 
most of our display technologies rely on one or more of our software products to manage and provide content for the display 
these software products range in complexity from scoring consoles  to the venus control software that allows the creation  display and scheduling of dynamic text and basic graphics content on electronic displays  to the venus display control system that controls multi color displays and video displays  providing the ability to create graphics and animation as well as interfacing with third party software for content 
additionally  our visiconn sm control software is used to display targeted messages to specific audiences and to control large networks of digital displays 
complementary software  such as our dakstats and interfacing software  is also available and can be fully integrated into the control software 
our display systems range from small scoreboards and digit displays priced at under  to large complex display systems priced in excess of million 
generally  our product sales are either custom products or standard catalog scoreboards or displays 
historically  these standard catalog sales have accounted for less than of our total annual revenues 
our custom products are customized in terms of size  configuration and installation type but are generally built using standard technology platforms 
in  we initiated various programs to reduce custom components in favor of much more standardized components that could be assembled and put together to form products that in the end are customized to the needs of the end users 
within each product family  we produce displays that vary in complexity  size and resolution 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display  and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  the light source  or pixels  are larger and spaced farther apart for longer distance viewing 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays  which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
we customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment 
product families and technologies our products are comprised of the following five major product families sports products  primarily all sport  tuff sport and omnisport scoreboards  sportsound sound systems and related controllers and products  automated rigging and hoist products  primarily our vortek line of hoists and related control systems  video products  primarily hd x  prostar  protour and proad displays and associated control systems  commercial products  primarily galaxy and valo displays and venus control systems  and transportation products  primarily vanguard displays 
each of these product families is discussed below 
sports products 
the sports products family includes a full line of indoor and outdoor scoreboards  timing systems  digit displays  sound systems  statistics software and other related products 
the indoor products range in complexity from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating message centers  advertising panels and hoist systems 
outdoor scoreboards range in complexity from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to large scoring systems incorporating message centers and advertising panels 
we expect that sports products sales in the future will continue to focus on the use of led technology due to its lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
because most of the products within the sports products group have significant standardization  we have been able to make progress on our goal of delivering the highest quality products while maintaining consistent margins 
we offer a variety of internally developed controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  which is a controller for portable scoreboards  to the all sport  which is designed for more sophisticated scoring systems  allowing for more user defined options 
these controllers can be interfaced with the scoreboards through radio frequencies  fiber optic connections or other means 
we also offer timing systems for sports events  primarily aquatics and track competitions 
these timing systems include our omnisport timing system 
the system has the capability to not only time and rank the competitors but also to interface to event management software created by other third parties to facilitate the administration of the sporting event 
as a key component of an integrated system  we market sports statistics and results software under the dakstats trademark 
the software allows entry and display of sports statistics and other information displays 
it is one of the leading applications of its type in professional  collegiate and high school sports 
automated rigging and hoist products 
the automated rigging and hoist product family includes our vortek automated rigging systems which complement our arena center hung scoreboard display systems for both small and large sporting facilities 
additionally  the vortek hoist provides automated rigging for theatre applications  primarily smaller theatres such as in high schools and similar venues 
the strengths of the vortek automated rigging systems include safety and ease of operation 
the vortek automation center includes intuitive touch screens and menus to control the integrated hoist systems in a central control system to provide for added safety and enhanced operation of a theatre production  making changes in scenery  lighting and sound preprogrammed  timed and easy to control 
we also offer custom hoists  primarily in the sports arena business  for all sizes of center hung video and scoring solutions 
these custom hoists  which are designed to the specifications of the center hung structure and the load and design features of its attachment points within a facility  provide the most capable and proven systems in the industry 
video products 
the video products family consists primarily of displays  which are comprised of a large number of pixels capable of creating various levels of video  graphics and animation  and controllers  which manage the operation of the display 
video display products are based on red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels or picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 
we offer a wide range of video display products for different applications and budgets 
variables in typical video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch  the brightness of the displays  the number of discrete colors that the display is able to produce color resolution and the viewing angle 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with no maximum to the size of display that can be built 
our prostar and hd x video display systems offer specifications second to none in the industry 
at the high end  the product is capable of producing trillion colors and is available with pixel spacing as close as three millimeters 
currently  we offer a wide range of pixel spacing  ranging from three millimeter to millimeter 
the three millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance  and the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with maximum viewing distances 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
our unique display control circuitry along with our proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures provide uniform colors across the display 
we have adapted our prostar technology into our proad digital advertising and information display system  the protour modular display system  the prorail display systems and our propixel tm display systems 
proad technology uses red  green and blue led modules configured in different height to width ratios to give arena and stadium facilities the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in various locations in the facility 
this application generally serves as a revenue generation source for facilities through advertising as well as a location to display information such as scoring and statistics 
protour display systems are comprised of lightweight individual modules or panels less than a square meter in size that are assembled together to form a display in a customizable height and width 
these panels are used in what we refer to as mobile and modular applications  such as touring shows and the events market 
prorail display systems incorporate our proad displays into a patented cabinet designed to serve as a replacement for the fascia of an upper deck in a stadium or arena  which in some cases saves construction costs and improves the sight lines of the fans 
propixel displays serve as architectural accents and channel lettering 
our main controller for these video displays is our venus controller  which is built on the windows operating system 
this high end controller provides advanced capability for controlling large video displays 
the v play event management software provides facilities with integrated and sophisticated event program management capabilities with integration to video equipment 
it provides instant replays  live action and overlays of information and it allows for the organization and playback of digital video and audio clips 
other video products controllers include the visiconn sm and v tour controllers 
each of these controllers is designed with unique features and functionality for unique market niches 
our v tour design interfaces between our display systems and other systems allowing  for example  scoreboard and video systems to receive and display information from computers used for statistics  timing or scoring 
these interfaces allow the display controller to send information back to a statistics system or customer computer and can automatically report continually updated sports scores and information from national wire services 
commercial products 
the key product lines in the commercial products family are our valo  galaxy and galaxypro product lines  which include various indoor and outdoor applications intended primarily as graphics and text based displays 
galaxy displays  available in both indoor and outdoor models  are our leading product line for commercial applications and are expected to be a key product line for growth in the future 
galaxy displays are red  amber or full color  with pixel spacing ranging from millimeter to millimeter depending on size and viewing distance 
they are used primarily as message centers to convey information and advertising to the consumers and the public 
the modular design of the product allows us to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
within the galaxy line  we offer various price points for similar sized displays of the same pixel spacing 
galaxypro displays are full matrix outdoor displays capable of displaying pre recorded video  text  graphics and animation 
galaxypro displays are offered in full color with pixel spacing from millimeter to millimeter 
galaxypro displays are capable of producing billion colors  have excellent color uniformity across the display and are fully compatible with our venus display control software 
the modular design of the product allows us to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
our valo displays  used primarily in the digital billboard marketplace  utilize the foundation of our prostar technology to create a unique digital display product for outdoor advertisers 
the product  which is used primarily to display static images that change at regular intervals  include many features and functionality that are unique to the outdoor advertising business  such as our patented mounting system  self adjusting brightness  improved energy consumption  and network security 
other product lines within the commercial products group include our datatime  datamaster  datatrac and dakticker displays 
the datatime product line consists of outdoor time and temperature displays in various character sizes 
the datatime displays feature a programmable time and temperature display and use a remote sensor for temperature data input 
the datamaster product line consists of outdoor rate  gas price  generic counting timing and lottery displays in various character sizes 
the datatime products are offered in red or amber  while the datamaster products are offered in red  amber and green 
the datamaster product line has growth potential in the petroleum market niche 
the datatrac product lines consist of indoor led displays comprised of discrete characters 
each character is spaced evenly horizontally and vertically from the adjacent character 
this provides the least expensive display per character for the display of text messages only 
dakticker displays are used primarily in financial institutions for ticker displays and to display other financial information 
datatrac and dakticker products have a controller in the display that is capable of receiving a downloaded display program and then operating independently to display that program until a new program is downloaded to it 
the majority of our commercial products group s products utilize our proprietary venus display control software to control the creation of messages and graphic sequences for downloading to the display 
this software is designed to be useable without any special training  and it is applicable to all general advertising or message presentation applications 
we also provide software that allows system integrators to write their own software using the venus software developer s kit to communicate to displays supplied by us 
several system integrators have implemented the venus protocol into their specific applications  resulting in additional display sales 
our valo display line utilizes the valo play control system to manage the operation and content of displays on a networked basis 
transportation products 
the transportation products family includes a wide range of led based products for road management  parking  mass transit and aviation applications 
the vanguard family of electronic displays  which lead transportation product sales  are typically used to direct traffic and inform motorists 
the vanguard line includes both permanently mounted and portable displays 
we have also developed a software control system for these displays to help transportation agencies manage large networks of displays 
our digit and directional displays are primarily marketed under the datamaster name and sold for use in parking facilities 
several of the transportation products are also routinely sold into our commercial and sports markets 
most of the transportation products are designed and tested to rigorous transportation industry standards 
our personnel routinely work with standards development organizations to assist in writing standards that benefit the public and take advantage of the latest display technologies 
sources of raw materials we source some of our raw materials  including leds  from a limited number of suppliers  primarily due to quality control or the customized nature of the materials 
the loss of one of these key suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business and operations 
for additional information  refer to item a risk factors 
from time to time  we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract  which generally does not exceed one year 
intellectual property we develop technology on a continuing basis that we consider for patent application 
we apply for the majority of our patents to establish the creation of the technology so that other parties cannot later claim ownership 
we generally do not pursue infringement claims on these patents when others infringe on them 
the remainder of our patents are designed to prevent infringement  and we aggressively pursue infringement claims for protection due to patent violations 
we apply for patents in the us and a limited number of foreign jurisdictions 
these patents generally pertain to our display technologies and product features and have various terms of duration 
the patents we hold which are designed to protect and prevent competitors from infringing include  for example  patents on mechanical designs such as our prorail system and our valo mount  our prostar formed cabinet and our latching system for modules 
they also include patents for product features and capabilities which we believe are superior in the marketplace and that give us a competitive position  such as our touchpad products for aquatics 
there are a limited number of patents that apply to our electronics due to the rapid rate of change in the industry 
however  we hold patents on such things as calibration methods and pixel arrangements 
due to the general nature of our business and the rapid rate of change in technology  we do not incur significant expenditures in defending or prosecuting patent claims 
we rely on trademarks  in addition to patents  to help establish and preserve limited proprietary protection for our products 
our trademarks are registered in the united states and other countries 
we also have numerous trademark applications pending 
these trademarks are used to establish brand recognition and distinction in our various markets 
product drawings  software  training and product manuals and other works of authorship are also subject to applicable copyright law protections 
we provide software to our customers in object code to help preserve our intellectual property rights 
we also rely on nondisclosure and license agreements with our employees 
despite these intellectual property protections  there can be no assurance that a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products 
seasonal nature of the business our sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for facilities where professional and major college sports events take place and large commercial systems and networks 
the seasonality of the sports market has also played a part in our sales and profit fluctuations 
as a result  sales and net income in the first and second quarters of a fiscal year tend to be higher than in the third quarter of a fiscal year  followed by higher levels in the fourth quarter leading into the first quarter of the following year 
the seasonality of the sports business is caused by sales related to facilities for football in the summer and early fall  followed by sales generally related to facilities for basketball and hockey in the fall  and finally facilities for baseball in the early to late spring 
this seasonal effect is generally compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during the third quarter 
the effects of seasonality unrelated to holidays are generally not found in our commercial  international and transportation business units  although the impact of large orders in those markets can cause significant fluctuations in sales and profits 
we believe that with the mix of business favoring more emphasis on outdoor advertising applications  we could see more seasonality in the commercial business unit in the future  with sales slowing in our winter months 
approximately of our net sales are in the schools and theatres and live events business units  are in the commercial business unit  are in the international business unit and the remaining approximately are in the transportation business unit 
gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than the gross margins on smaller orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on the majority of these larger orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
working capital items on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
customers the primary markets we serve  along with types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers live events large colleges and universities  professional sports teams and facilities  olympic games  national and international sports federations  civic arenas and convention centers  staging and rental  and motor racing 
schools and theatres elementary and secondary schools  small colleges and universities  local recreation centers and theatres 
commercial retailers  outdoor advertisers  hospitality providers  quick serve restaurants  financial institutions  casinos  pari mutuel racing and other similar businesses 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries  parking facilities and transit authorities 
we have a large and diverse customer base 
the nature of our business generally is not repetitive business from one or a few significant customers 
as a result  the loss of a major customer generally would not have a material adverse impact on us 
backlog our backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders that we expect to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of april  and million as of april  because sales agreements and purchase orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by customers with a limited or no penalty  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
although orders for many of our products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
contracts related to new construction projects generally tend to have the longest lead times 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these laws and regulations include those that impose greater restrictions on electronic displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of our products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
we design and produce our products in accordance with these standards 
our printed circuit board manufacturing operations use certain chemical processes that are subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
our manufacturing operations must also meet various safety related rules and regulations 
we believe we are in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations 
in some countries in which we operate  including china  there are various laws and regulations that restrict or limit our ability to withdraw our capital investment 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition from a variety of sources 
there are a number of established suppliers of competing products who may have greater market penetration in certain of our market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources 
competitors also attempt to copy our products or product features 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  we may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
there are generally more competitors in product categories and applications that require less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market and the text and graphics display markets 
as the needs of customers increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
however  due to the high profile nature of larger complex display systems  the competition is generally more intense 
within our standard product business  which includes our galaxy and valo display lines and scoreboard products  there are a large number of competitors  none of which we consider to be dominant 
in addition  in the galaxy display business  there are a significant number of asian competitors that attempt to penetrate our marketplace 
we generally compete based on our depth of service and the wide range of our product offerings 
within our large video system business  across all segments  there are various competitors that have different levels of strength in individual niches  none that have a dominant position overall 
for example  a single competitor may have strength in the mobile video business but very little in the fixed installation business 
another competitor may have strength in the billboard display business but very little strength in any other video system applications 
in addition  our large display business has competitors in a narrow niche that were significant at one time in that niche and then substantially decrease their presence in that niche 
these changes seem to happen as a result of the complexities of the marketplace and the failures that are experienced on installations that receive a great deal of visibility 
our video systems are highly complex and visible  requiring a high standard of performance that is difficult for other industry participants to maintain over the long term 
our competitors are not generally aligned by business unit 
the focus of competitors tends to be more of a product focus 
for example  our galaxy line of displays have competitors that are also concentrated in the commercial business unit  although  like us  they also compete with these same products in our other business units 
competitors with a focus on video displays compete generally across all our business units 
overall  we compete based on our broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery and reliable and readily available customer service and support 
we also strive to provide cost effective products and solutions for our customers 
contrary to our focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  some of our competitors compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems  which are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or less customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  we are less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance our existing products  introduce new products and product features  and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 
research and development we believe our engineering capability and experience are unparalleled among our competitors and that our product development capability will continue to be a very important factor in our markets 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
environmental concerns we believe that we do not have any environmental issues that would materially affect capital expenditures  earnings or our competitive position in the marketplace 
employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees and approximately part time and temporary employees 
of these employees  approximately  were in manufacturing   were in sales  marketing and customer service  were in engineering and were in administration 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact our future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  our success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products and other factors  including those set forth below 
competition could result in lower sales and decreased margins 
we operate in highly competitive markets that  in certain portions of the business  are highly fragmented 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  our products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also in the prices charged by us for our products 
to remain competitive  we must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to our customers needs and enhance and upgrade our existing products and services to meet those needs but also continue to price our products competitively 
our competitors may develop cheaper  more efficient products  or may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and other resources than we do and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product improvement  innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend in part on our ability to continue to make timely and cost effective product improvements  innovations and developments 
we enter into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis 
almost all the contracts we enter into are on a fixed price basis 
if our actual costs exceed original estimates on fixed price contracts  our profits will be reduced 
although we benefit from cost savings  we have a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to  increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform or a delay in performing their obligations 
these factors could delay delivery of products  and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs that cannot be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact our profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit the recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit if a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected  and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
if we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
for these reasons  backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
our ability to conduct business outside the united states may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control  which could adversely affect net sales and profits from international sales 
for fiscal years  and  revenue outside the united states represented approximately  and of our consolidated net sales  respectively 
our operations and earnings throughout the world have been and may in the future be affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and adverse tax consequences 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the united states 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making it difficult to estimate future revenue and earnings 
our quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts we enter into generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects them to many factors beyond our control 
furthermore  because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on our quarterly operating results 
factors that could cause our operating results to vary also include new product introductions  variations in product and project mix and delivery due date changes 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations  and operating results in one quarter may not be indicative of future operating results 
our products are covered by warranties and fulfilling these warranties could adversely affect our financial results 
unanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
we provide warranties on our products generally for terms of five years or less in the case of standard products and one year or less in the case of custom orders 
in addition  in response to customer needs  we regularly offer extended warranties 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
although we continually monitor our warranty claims and provide a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in some cases  we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect our reputation 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage to protect us in the event of such a claim  our coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
large contracts with significant customers represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  because some of the exposure is outside of our control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts and the size and timing of large contracts 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts  primarily in the professional and major college facilities market and the outdoor advertising niche  and the amounts and timing of these contracts 
whether we are awarded large contracts and their timing and amount could also cause material fluctuations in our net sales and earnings 
awards of large contracts and their timing and amount are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations  and if we default on our credit facility  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the terms and conditions of our million revolving credit facility impose restrictions that limit  among other things  our ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions and create or incur liens 
the availability of the credit facility is also subject to certain covenants as explained later in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure that we will achieve operating results meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare any outstanding principal amount of the credit facility and term debt  any and all accrued interest thereon and any and all other amounts payable under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of our credit facility 
our ability to satisfy any debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
it is anticipated that borrowings from the existing credit facility and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance our capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may make future acquisitions  which may be difficult to integrate  divert management resources  result in unanticipated costs or dilute our shareholders 
part of our business strategy is to make acquisitions of or investments in companies  products or technologies that complement our current products  enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities  or offer growth opportunities 
we currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
additional risks associated with acquisitions include the following it may be difficult to integrate the purchased company  products or technologies into our own business  we may incur substantial unanticipated integration costs  management information and accounting systems of an acquired business must be integrated into our current systems  assimilating the acquired businesses may divert significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and could disrupt our ongoing business  we may enter markets in which we have limited prior experience  acquisitions could result in the loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired operations  we may have difficulty retaining or developing the acquired businesses customers  acquisitions could adversely affect our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  we may fail to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and or the strategic benefits of the acquisitions  and we may incur liabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims  and we may not be successful in seeking indemnification for such liabilities or claims 
in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could incur debt  amortization expenses related to intangible assets  large and immediate write offs  assume liabilities  or issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage of ownership 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  could create additional uncertainties  forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet shareholders expectations  and the prices at which it trades may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception that such sales could occur 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of certain members of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees  but we do maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services 
we may not be able to successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future  and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  even if we are successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming 
we maintain inventory that is subject to obsolescence and write downs to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of our products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by us is subject to the risk of obsolescence and excess levels that may not be saleable 
losses incurred as a result could have an adverse impact on our future profits 
we depend on single source suppliers for some of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we obtain some of our raw materials  including leds  from a limited number of suppliers 
if we cannot obtain some key raw materials from our suppliers  we cannot assure you that the raw materials will be readily available from other suppliers  that other suppliers will agree to supply the materials to us on terms which are equivalent to the terms we currently receive  or that the raw materials from any other suppliers will be of adequate quality 
although we believe our supply of raw materials currently is adequate for the needs of our business  we cannot assure you that new sources of supply will be available when needed 
any interruption in our supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is located and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be inadequate  our financial results may not be accurate  raising concerns for investors and potentially adversely affecting our stock price 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  and will continue to do so for future periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements  and the receipt of a positive attestation  or any attestation at all  from our independent registered public accounting firm 
in addition  our assessment of our internal controls may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors and therefore adversely affect our stock price 
our manufacturing would be interrupted if we were unable to use one of our manufacturing facilities 
we manufacture most of our products in two locations in south dakota and one in minnesota 
if any of these facilities were to be destroyed  shut down or unable to be used for its intended purposes  we would be limited in our capacity to meet customer demands until a replacement facility and equipment  if necessary  was found 
the replacement of the manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time before manufacturing operations could restart 
the delay engendered by  and the potential cost incurred in  these steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the protections we have adopted may cause takeover offers to be decided by the board rather than our shareholders 
of the  shares of capital stock authorized in our articles of incorporation   shares are undesignated 
our board of directors may issue the undesignated shares on terms and with the rights  preferences and designations determined by the board without shareholder action  which could be used to discourage takeover attempts 
our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board consisting of three classes of directors 
a classified board generally makes it more difficult to replace directors and to acquire our company 
in addition  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that provides for the exercise of preferred share purchase rights when a person becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding common stock subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of the current south dakota business corporation act sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock  which in turn have a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions that prohibit a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination  as defined in the sd act  with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the sd act also limits the voting rights of shares acquired in specified types of acquisitions and that restrict specified types of business combinations 
the existence or issuance of blank check stock  the classified board  the existence of our shareholder rights plan and the effect of anti takeover provisions under south dakota law  individually or in the aggregate  may discourage potential takeover attempts and delay  deter or prevent a change in control 
they also may make the removal of management more difficult  which could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares at prices higher than prevailing market prices

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our principal real estate properties are located in areas we deem necessary to meet sales  service and operating requirements 
we consider all of the properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet current and near term operating requirements 
as of april   we leased approximately facilities throughout the united states and facilities outside the united states used for sales and service offices 
we also lease two facilities in sioux falls  south dakota  comprising approximately  square feet 
one of the leases contain an option to purchase the building from may  through may  and the right to lease an additional  square feet in the third quarter of fiscal year our canadian subsidiary occupies approximately  square feet in a sales and manufacturing facility in montreal  quebec under a lease agreement 
our china subsidiary leases approximately  square feet in a building in shanghai that is comprised of sales  service and manufacturing 
the majority of the remaining sales and service offices located throughout the united states  europe and china are small offices  generally consisting of less than  square feet leased under operating leases 
we periodically review the benefits of owning our properties 
these lease obligations expire on various dates with the longest commitment extending to fiscal year we believe all of our leases will be renewable at market terms at our option as they become due 
we own various buildings in brookings  south dakota totaling approximately  square feet and a building in redwood falls  minnesota  totaling approximately  square feet 
in fiscal year  we committed to purchase a building in brookings  south dakota  on or before september  for approximately million 
the building will be used for both manufacturing and office expansion  is located adjacent to our existing facilities and has approximately  square feet 
during fiscal year  we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of our building in tampa  florida 
this building was primarily used as office space but contained a production studio that would be available for rent by us after the sale closes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet for a new building in shanghai  china 
this includes space for more significant manufacturing  and we expect to occupy the building in the fourth quarter of fiscal year item legal proceedings we are involved in a variety of legal actions relating to various legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
although we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions  it is the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on business units  geographical regions and products 
the primary business units consist of live events  commercial  schools and theatres  international and transportation 
our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for professional sport facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales and gross profit percentages also have fluctuated due to other seasonality factors  including the impact of holidays  which primarily impact our third quarter 
our gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for large custom orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations may be subject to similar fluctuations 
orders are booked only upon receipt of a firm contract and after receipt of any required deposits 
as a result  certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be booked until all required contractual documents and deposits are received 
in addition  order bookings can vary significantly as a result of the timing of large orders 
we operate on a to week fiscal year  with our fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
within each fiscal year  each quarter is comprised of week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year 
in each week year  each of the last three quarters is comprised of a week period  and an additional week is added to the first quarter of that fiscal year 
when april falls on a wednesday  the fiscal year ends on the preceding saturday 
fiscal years  and each contained weeks 
fiscal year will contain weeks 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on our financial results  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report or the section of this item entitled recent accounting pronouncements 
beginning in fiscal year  we implemented the business unit structure as described previously  which caused the creation of segments 
before fiscal  we focused on three main markets for sales sports  commercial and transportation  which were similar to the corresponding business unit 
the main changes implemented in the beginning of fiscal year were the inclusion of international operations as a unique business unit as opposed to being included in the individual markets 
the inclusion of mobile and modular sales in live events as opposed to commercial 
the separation of the schools and theatres business and large sports venue business into different business units rather than being combined in the sports market 
the analysis that is contained under the headings of fiscal as compared to fiscal year describes the changes based on this new business unit structure  while the analysis contained under the headings of fiscal as compared to fiscal year describes the changes based on the previous market structure 
it is not practical to restate the fiscal year financial results to the comparable fiscal year segment data as a result of the limitations of the data from fiscal year where orders  net sales and expenses are categorized differently  primarily as explained above 
fiscal year data was created in a manner that allowed for identification of these changes early in fiscal year which made that year possible for generating comparable values 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term construction type contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term construction type contracts 
earnings on long term construction type contracts construction type contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are capable of being estimated 
generally  construction type contracts we enter into have fixed prices established  and to the extent the actual costs to complete construction type contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when we revise our estimates 
our practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates are known 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to determine these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairment in customers ability to pay  we review aging reports  contact customers in connection with collection efforts and review other available information 
although we consider our allowance for doubtful accounts adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of april  and april   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of and million  respectively 
warranties 
we have recognized a reserve for warranties on our products equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under the warranties 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated warranty costs  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine our reserve for warranties 
as of april  and april   we had million and million reserved for warranty costs  respectively 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
we recognize deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated costs under these agreements in excess of our deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  we examine cost trends on the contracts and other information and compare that to the deferred revenue 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine estimated costs under these agreements 
as of april  and april   we had million and million of deferred revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance  respectively 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal  and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  we estimate market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market  and any necessary charges are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which they occur 
in determining market value  we review various factors such as current inventory levels  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the estimated market value of inventory 
however  if market conditions change  including changes in technology  product components used in our products or in expected sales  we may be exposed to unforeseen losses that could be material 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in each jurisdiction  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we review deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  and for those not expecting to be realized  we have recognized a valuation allowance 
if our estimates of future taxable income are not met  a valuation allowance for some of these deferred tax assets would be required 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions  both domestic and international  and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amounts to various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we record our income tax provision based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including the existing tax laws  the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures  consistent with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 

a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  when the statue of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information become available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that any potential tax assessments from various tax authorities that are not covered by our income tax provision will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
some of the countries we are located in allow tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted which in some cases could occur if we fail to satisfy the conditions on which such holidays or incentives are based  they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
it is anticipated that tax incentives with respect to certain operations will expire within the next four years 
however  due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations  we are unable to predict how these expirations will impact us in the future 
in addition  any acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase  depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located 
stock based compensation effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  we recognized compensation expense for share based payments that vested during the fiscal years ended april  and april  using the following valuation methods a for share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   the grant date fair value was estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and b for share based payments granted on or after april   the grant date fair value was estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and the presentation of our consolidated statement of cash flows 
however  we believe that stock based compensation aligns the interests of managers and non employee directors with the interests of shareholders 
as a result  we do not currently expect to significantly change our stock based compensation program 
we use the black scholes standard option pricing model black scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding other variables  including projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected volatility of our stock price in future periods and expected dividend yield 
we analyze historical employee exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption 
we believe that historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option 
the risk free interest rate we use is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock price in future periods by using the implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options for our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use an expected dividend yield consistent with our dividend yield over the period of time we have paid dividends in the black scholes option valuation model 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net earnings and net earnings per share of a future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  year ended april  april  april  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the level of net sales generated in fiscal year in all five business units was limited as a result of capacity constraints within our manufacturing facilities  both in terms of space and personnel 
this trend began in the second quarter of fiscal year and diminished to a large degree in the third quarter of fiscal year as a result of the ramping up of our facilities in brookings and sioux falls  south dakota  and redwood falls  minnesota 
these capacity constraints did not exist in fiscal year commercial business unit 
net sales in the commercial business unit increased approximately during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year from million to million 
the largest growth in terms of dollars and as a percentage is attributable to increases in our outdoor advertising niche followed by a smaller increase in sales of our standard galaxy product line 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we experienced a lengthening of lead times in our galaxy product line caused by supply chain challenges and plant execution 
we addressed these issues in the third quarter of fiscal  but this negatively impacted sales and orders during fiscal year addressing this allowed us to catch up on delayed orders of galaxy products and reduce lead times to acceptable levels in the third quarter of fiscal we also believe that adverse economic conditions in the fourth quarter had an impact on the overall level of business within this product category 
overall  the commercial business unit continues to benefit from increasing product acceptance  lower cost of displays  our expanding distribution network  and a better understanding by our customers of the product as a revenue generation tool 
the most significant factor for increasing sales has been the order volume of digital displays for outdoor advertising companies 
this occurred primarily due to an increase in our customer base and the increasing number of displays being purchased by existing customers 
we also believe that our valo digital billboard product line will help us maintain and potentially grow our market share due to its features and functions 
we believe that the outdoor advertising business has a number of constraints  primarily economic and regulatory  which to date our customers have been successful at overcoming 
we expect that the commercial business unit will continue to grow in fiscal as compared to fiscal year and is likely to be one of the fastest growing parts of our business 
as the outdoor advertising business has become a larger percent of our mix  we believe that the seasonality of that business could become a factor in the fluctuation of our net sales because the deployment of displays slows in the winter months in the northern portion of the us generally speaking  seasonality is not a material factor in the rest of the commercial business 
our rate of growth in the commercial business unit could vary significantly depending on our success in capturing and retaining the business of the major billboard companies as well as on their rate of deployment 
our growth in the commercial business unit is partially dependent on the state of the economy  which as stated above negatively impacted net sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and is expected to impact it into fiscal year to date  we have not experienced adverse effects of the economy on the outdoor advertising portion of our business 
we believe that this will sustain economic downturns to some degree given the economics of the technology for advertising 
order bookings in the commercial business unit were up approximately during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the smaller than expected increase for the year was due to a lower level of orders of galaxy products  for the reasons described above and lower than expected large contract orders in this segment 
live events business unit 
net sales in the live events business unit declined by approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year from million to million 
during fiscal year  orders for live events  primarily large sports venues  were unusually high 
as a result  we had expected that sales for fiscal year would be limited in growth potential aside from the impact of some exceptionally large potential projects  orders and their related conversion to sales 
we believe that this is the nature of the large contract business and the inherent volatility that exists 
orders increased approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year included in these orders are a greater than historical level of dollars that have longer lead times to start manufacturing 
this generally happens when a greater percentage of the business is new construction as opposed to major upgrades 
it is difficult to assess whether these longer lead time projects will contribute to higher than expected sales when they are actually delivered  which could occur if we were to book a reasonable level of orders in the first half of fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we were awarded a contract for a professional sports facility which is expected to book in the first quarter of fiscal year the value of this contract could exceed million  of which more than million of sales are expected in fiscal year within the live events business unit  we expect that net sales in fiscal year could grow by more than over fiscal year as a result of the backlog that existed at the end of fiscal year and the expected order growth for the year 
growth over the long term in large sports venues is due to a number of factors  including the expanding market  with facilities spending more on larger display systems  our product and services offering  which remains the most integrated and comprehensive offering in the industry  and our sales and service network  which are important to support our customers 
in addition  we benefit from the competitive nature of sports teams who strive to out perform their competitors with display systems 
this impact has and is expected to continue to be a driving force in increasing transaction sizes in new construction and major renovations 
growth in large sports venues is also driven by the desire for high definition video displays  which typically drive larger displays or higher resolution displays  both of which increase the average transaction size 
we believe that the effects of the economy have a lesser impact on the sports market as compared to our other markets because our products are generally revenue generation tools through advertising for facilities  and the sports business is generally considered to be a recession resistant business 
net sales in our sports marketing and mobile and modular portion of this business unit were not significant in fiscal year or net sales in both these areas were less than of total sales in both fiscal years 
an important factor in orders and sales for fiscal year will be our success in winning a limited number of large contracts expected to be awarded in the large sports venue market 
there are a number of transactions exceeding million which could have a significant impact on both orders and sales during the upcoming four quarters  including the largest one mentioned above 
schools and theatres business unit 
net sales in the schools and theatres business unit increased approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  from million to million the increase in net sales has been impacted by the acquisition of the hoist business late in the second quarter of fiscal year and more orders being booked as we further penetrate the market 
the growth of this business is driven to a large degree by the depth  quality  performance and service of the products offered 
orders within this business unit have increased at a much higher rate and are up approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we expect that orders and net sales in fiscal year will grow by more than as compared to fiscal year within this business unit 
transportation business unit 
net sales in the transportation business unit increased approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  from million to million 
orders for fiscal year are up approximately 
we believe that the increases in net sales and orders in this business are due  in part  to legislation passed during calendar year by the united states congress that provided for increased spending on transportation projects  including large increases associated with intelligent transportation systems  and to us gaining market share 
we expect that net sales and orders in the transportation business unit could grow by more than in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year international business unit 
net sales in the international business unit increased by approximately in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  from million to million 
the increase was attributable to the success we are experiencing in europe and asia  which are the primary geographic areas of focus for us 
orders have increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to the focus on large contracts in this business unit and the small number of contracts actually booked  volatility is inherent  and it is not expected that this rate of growth in orders is sustainable 
overall  we are making considerable investments in growing our business internationally  where we do not have the same market share as we do domestically  and we believe net sales will increase by more than in fiscal year as compared to we continue to see success with our efforts in asia and  as a result of our expanding line of protour products  we expect that european sales will also expand 
we also developed during fiscal year important relationships with customers that may award large repeat orders to us that could drive sales significantly  although there are no contractual commitments to do so 
advertising revenues 
we occasionally sell products in exchange for the advertising revenues generated from the use of our display products 
these sales represented less than of net sales for fiscal years and the gross profit percent on these transactions have typically been higher than the gross profit percent on other transactions of similar size  although the selling expenses associated with these transactions are typically higher 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase was across all three markets  with the commercial market showing the most significant growth on a percentage basis 
net sales increased both domestically and internationally 
as a percent of net sales  standard orders declined to approximately of net sales in fiscal as compared to in the previous fiscal year 
we believe that all areas of our business were impacted by capacity constraints in the first half of fiscal year  as the order volume during this period and the period preceding it exceeded expectations 
the constraints were diminished to acceptable levels during the fiscal year the increase in net sales in the commercial market in fiscal year over fiscal year was approximately 
this increase is attributed to both standard and custom projects 
the increase in custom projects is due primarily to the increase in orders from outdoor advertising companies and our success internationally  primarily in asian markets  while the increase in standard product orders is due to the growth in our galaxy and galaxypro displays both within the national account portion of our business and through resellers 
overall  the commercial market benefited from increasing product acceptance  lower cost of displays  our expanding distribution network  international expansion  and a better understanding by our customers of the product as a revenue generation tool 
for fiscal year  net sales exceeded our expectations set at the beginning of the year 
the most significant factor for exceeding these expectations was orders from outdoor advertising companies  which more than doubled 
this occurred primarily due to an increase in our customer base and the increasing amount of displays being purchased by existing customers 
the overall growth is due to our expanded distribution network  greater product acceptance  international expansion  the development of our resellers and integrated product offerings 
the increase in net sales in the sports markets of approximately resulted from increases in sales to large and small sports venues 
net sales increased both domestically and internationally 
the number of major new construction and renovation projects for professional facilities was not a significant factor in increasing net sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this growth in sales for large and small sports venues was due to a number of factors  including the expanding market  with facilities spending more on larger display systems  our product and services offering  which remains the most integrated and comprehensive offering in the industry  and our sales and service network  which is important to support our customers 
in addition  we benefit from the competitive nature of sports teams who strive to out perform their competitors with display systems 
this is also driven by the desire for high definition video displays  which typically drive larger displays or higher resolution displays  both of which increase the average transaction size 
net sales in our sports marketing portion of this business did not perform as well as expected 
net sales in this sports marketing were less than of total sales for fiscal year orders as opposed to net sales in the sports market also performed much better in fiscal year as compared to this improved performance is due to the same reasons indicated for the increase in net sales in the sports market 
the increase in net sales in the transportation market for fiscal was approximately  resulting from an increase in spending on state and local transportation projects 
this increase  which relates primarily to sales of our vanguard product line  was due in part to furthering our penetration with more jurisdictions across the united states 
orders in the transportation market were up over for fiscal year versus fiscal year we believe that this increase is due to legislation passed during calendar year by congress that provided for increased spending on transportation projects  including large increases associated with intelligent transportation systems  and as a result of gaining market share 
we do not believe we experienced any adverse effects in fiscal year as opposed to fiscal year as a result of the state of the economy in the markets in which we operate 
backlog our backlog at the end of fiscal year was million as compared to million at the end of fiscal year the growth in backlog was the highest in the live events business unit due to large projects related to new sports stadiums that will convert to net sales in fiscal year backlog also increased over fiscal year in the commercial and schools and theatres business units and declined in the transportation business unit 
overall  the increase was the result of the order bookings as compared to previous quarters 
backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the effects of large orders  and significant variations can be expected  as explained previously 
in addition  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also as explained previously 
we occasionally sell products in exchange for advertising revenues from display systems  primarily in sports facilities 
these revenues represented less than of net sales for each of fiscal years  and the gross profit margin on these net sales has historically been comparable to or higher than the gross profit margin on other net sales of similar sized installations although we experience a higher selling cost related to booking these transactions 
gross profit fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above and an increase in the gross profit percentage 
gross profits have been positively impacted by higher gross margins on contract orders  which rose during the first half of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and then declined in the second half of the year 
the positive factors influencing gross profit margin include new products offered  which are able to earn a higher average margin in the marketplace  declines in raw materials pricing  greater absorption of facilities costs as net sales increase and the competitive landscape 
the new products have been the main driver of the increase  which have added in excess of margin points  while the effects of the raw materials pricing and the increased absorption have been slightly less than that 
offsetting these positive implications were the lower margins associated with the large orders for professional sports facilities  which traditionally carry smaller margins 
we are optimistic that we can increase the actual margin on these transactions but not sufficiently to keep margins from declining slightly 
we also incurred significantly higher costs of warranties as a percent of sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a percent of net sales  warranty costs were approximately of net sales in fiscal year as compared to of net sales in fiscal year these higher warranty costs tend to drive much higher indirect labor costs as well  which rose significantly in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the impact of these indirect labor costs associated with services overall adversely impacted the gross margin percentage  decreasing it by margin points and affecting all business units 
within the commercial business unit  gross margin percents increased approximately percentage points in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of the higher margins in the outdoor advertising portion of that business as compared to the prior year 
this increase began to dissipate in the second half of fiscal year as we renegotiated pricing with our customers for our new valo digital billboard product 
for fiscal year  we expect that the gross margin percents in the commercial business unit will decline as a result 
we were also negatively impacted by higher costs and manufacturing variances associated with our galaxy product line due to the various manufacturing issues discussed above 
gross profit percentages in the live events business unit declined approximately percentage point in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decline resulted from the impact of warranty costs  higher indirect labor costs associated with services and higher manufacturing variances during the fiscal year 
this was offset by better performance on contracts as we were able to decrease costs on certain video products without having to reduce pricing 
gross profit declined on an international basis approximately margin points in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  which we attribute to the impact of warranty costs and the impact of some of the larger transactions booked during the fiscal year that generally carry a lower gross profit margin 
the schools and theatres business unit and the transportation business unit gross profit margin percents did not change materially in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we strive toward higher gross margins as a percent of net sales  although depending on the actual mix  the performance of larger projects  and our ability to execute on the business and level of future sales  margin percentages may not increase and are likely to remain below the levels of the last fiscal year in the upcoming quarter due to the impact of large sports projects  declining margin percents in the billboard niche and greater investment in manufacturing initiatives 
we expect that the gross profit percentage may decline in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of the large professional sports projects that we expect will contribute to revenue during the year and the impact of lower gross margin percents being achieved on sales to outdoor advertising customers 
however  depending on the competitive environment  the actual mix  the level of future sales and other factors described elsewhere  margin percentages may vary from this expectation 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above  partially offset by a decline in the gross profit percentage 
the most significant factors affecting gross profit margin included the costs of bringing additional capacity on line  which included new facilities in three locations  higher costs of depreciation  inefficiencies in the manufacturing process  the costs associated with implementing lean manufacturing techniques  performance on contracts  the impact of operating at capacity during a significant portion of the year  and higher overall warranty costs 
finally  the mix between small orders and large custom orders impacted the gross profit percentage adversely  as the small orders generally have margins in excess of and the large orders have margins of generally less than 
operating expenses fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative expenses and product design and development costs  increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
all areas within operating expenses were impacted by higher personnel costs to support our growth and higher benefit costs  consisting primarily of the cost of medical insurance 
as a percentage of net sales  the increase is attributable in general to the investment we made to position us for the market opportunities we see in the future 
in addition  we believe that as we grow  we need to make incremental investments which may cause pressure on earnings early on but contribute positively to financial results over time 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative expenses and product design and development costs  increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment expenses  facilities related costs for sales and service offices and expenditures for marketing efforts  including the costs of collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were of net sales in fiscal years and the increase in selling expenses was attributable to higher levels of personnel costs  which comprised over of the increase  and international expansion  which comprised more than of the increase 
the remaining increase was caused by the increased facilities and infrastructure costs incurred with the facilities expansion  primarily in brookings  south dakota 
the increase in the number of employees was planned to cover growth expectations across all markets and included the impact of hiring additional personnel to support various other investments made into growing areas  such as our services business and commercial sales 
the increase in the international costs included increased costs of personnel and related items 
we expect to continue to invest in organic growth  and therefore the dollar amount of selling expenses will increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year however  as a percentage of net sales  we believe that selling expenses could decrease 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expenses was attributable to higher levels of personnel costs  international expansion  employee benefits  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  telephone costs  the increased number of sales and service offices and other costs associated with a higher number of employees 
the increase in the number of employees was planned to cover growth expectations across all markets and included the impact of hiring additional personnel to support various other investments made into growing areas  such as our services business 
the increase in travel and entertainment expense is due to having more employees in fiscal year and higher sales 
higher depreciation costs are primarily due to the increased investment in demonstration products and the support needs for the greater number of employees 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  training costs  amortization of intangibles and the costs of supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of net sales  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative costs were the result of higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support our growth  including international growth  which comprised more than of the increases  and higher costs related to the infrastructure and investments made in fiscal year  such as higher computer hardware and software maintenance costs from prior fiscal years commitments and greater depreciation costs  which comprised approximately of the increased spending 
the remaining increases are from various items such as increased amortization expense related to fiscal year acquisitions  higher employee benefit costs due to expanded benefits and increased health insurance costs  and higher bank fees related to higher credit card fees and international expansion 
we expect that for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses will decline as a percent of sales and that their dollar amount will increase between and for the year as a whole 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of net sales  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative costs were the result of higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support our growth  including international growth  higher travel costs related to new projects undertaken related to growth  higher professional and consulting fees  and significantly higher information technology and human resource related costs designed to position us for future growth and opportunities 
product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs and facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
investments in our common module platforms and various other initiatives to standardize display components  our line of prostar  hd x and protour video displays and other display technologies and related items  including control systems for both single site displays and networked displays spread over a geographical area  continued to drive increases in investments in new products 
we continued to invest in many other product lines and families  including our galaxy display technology  sportsound systems and control systems 
we developed new products and enhanced products  including our new line of valo digital billboards  full color video displays and a wider range of protour products with more pixel density options 
we also invested heavily in initiatives designed to improve manufacturing processes and decreasing the cost of our products 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were of net sales for both fiscal years and  respectively 
investments in our protour product line  narrowcasting solutions  our new line of hd x video displays and other display technologies and related items continued to drive increases in investments in new products 
in addition  we continued to invest across all other product lines  including display technologies  sound systems and control systems 
we developed new products  including our new line of vanguard roadside display trailers  full color video displays and a new pixel format for our hd x display product  to address the high definition market  and we invested heavily in initiatives designed to improve manufacturing processes and decrease the costs of the product 
operating income by segment the following table sets forth operating income loss by segment year ended in thousands april  april  operating income loss commercial live events schools theatres transportation international segment operating income operating income loss by segment is based on the direct costs associated with each segment plus allocations of various expenses on a discretionary basis that are not necessarily indicative of the segment s operating income on a stand alone basis 
certain items are allocated based on management s judgment as to the best methods to achieve company wide goals 
therefore  we caution making conclusions as to performance based on these disclosures  which are required under generally accepted accounting principles 
segment data was not available prior to fiscal year  as we then considered ourselves as operating in a single industry segment 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we reorganized the business and implemented business units which qualify as segments under generally accepted accounting principles 
within the commercial business unit  operating income increased as a result of the increase in sales for the unit  with a percentage point increase in gross profit and increased leverage of selling expense as a percent of sales 
operating income decreased in the live events business unit as a result of a decline in sales as described above  along with a point decrease in gross profit margin 
in addition  selling expenses increased by approximately million 
the operating income in schools and theatres business unit increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of higher sales at similar gross profit margins offset by higher selling  product development expenses and allocations of general and administrative expenses 
within the transportation business unit  operating income remained flat as a result of a growth in sales being offset by higher operating expenses 
interest income and expense we occasionally generate interest income through product sales on an installment basis  under lease arrangements or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from displays  which result in long term receivables 
we also invest excess cash in short term temporary cash investments and marketable securities that generate interest income 
interest expense is comprised primarily of interest on our notes payable and long term debt 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the decrease was the result of lower levels of interest bearing marketable securities 
this was offset partially by higher levels of interest bearing long term receivables 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year as compared million for fiscal year the increase was due to higher levels of debt outstanding and higher average interest rates on that debt during fiscal year fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income expense  net  decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year interest income was less than of net sales for each of fiscal years and the decrease was attributable to the reduction of temporary cash investments and marketable securities as a result of the decreased cash flow during the year and an increase in debt outstanding primarily to fund our capacity expansion during the year and investments in media businesses 
income taxes fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was attributable primarily to the increase in income before taxes 
in addition  we also realized benefits from amending federal tax returns to take advantage of foreign tax credits related to business outside the united states and a lower effective state income tax rate related to fiscal years and  which was realized in fiscal year the effective rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal year we benefit from lower tax rates overall in china  where we were able to generate taxable income that is subject to a tax holiday for a fixed period of time after we began generating a profit 
furthermore  there are lower rates in the other asian markets in which we operate 
finally  we were eligible for research and development tax credits for only seven months of fiscal year as compared to all of fiscal year if the credit were to be reinstated and be retroactive to the prior expiration  we would benefit in the year of passage 
for fiscal year  we expect that our overall effective rate will increase depending on the amount of income in lower tax foreign jurisdictions 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was attributable primarily to the increase in income before taxes  which was more than offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate 
the effective rate decreased to approximately in fiscal year from approximately in fiscal year this decrease in the effective rate is due primarily to the completion of an irs audit of fiscal years through  which included primarily the benefits of research and development tax credits 
in addition  we benefited from the lower tax rates in asia  where we were able to generate taxable income that is subject to a tax holiday for a fixed period of time after we began operations there 
finally  we benefited from a retroactive enactment of the research and development tax credit  which had previously expired 
fiscal year fourth quarter summary during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  net sales increased to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased sales in the international and commercial business units 
gross margin percentage declined from in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the decline in gross profit levels was primarily due to higher warranty costs in the quarter and the impact of lower than expected sales  which resulted in less overhead absorption 
selling and general and administrative costs increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the increases were primarily due to higher costs of infrastructure  including personnel  depreciation  facilities and information systems costs  which were offset by lower bad debt costs 
product development costs increased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to million as compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase was due to a greater emphasis put on product development in the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the lower level of contract revenues as compared to total engineering overhead 
net interest income increased to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year from a net interest expense of million 
the increase was due primarily to lower levels of interest expense resulting from less debt outstanding and lower interest rates 
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year improved to from in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the improvement was due to lower than expected state income tax rates that apply to fiscal year which were recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal and benefits from lower tax rates on incomes in foreign jurisdictions 
further  an adjustment to reduce income tax expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of in the amount of to correct an error arising in prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at april  compared to million at april  we have historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
cash provided by operations for fiscal year was million 
net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of million  million in changes in net operating assets  the add back of equity in net losses of equity investments  and stock based compensation  less the gain on sale of equity investments  generated the cash provided by operations 
the most significant drivers of the changes in net operating assets were the increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and warranty obligations  and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
these increases were partially offset by increases in inventories  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  deferred income taxes and long term receivables 
the improvement in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings is the result of deposits we receive on orders and included deposits on a few large orders  primarily with outdoor advertising customers 
the increase in accrued expenses and warranties is the result of higher than customary warranty reserves established in fiscal year as a percentage of sales 
with regard to operating assets  we saw a reduction in the levels of inventory and accounts receivable as a percent of sales  which helped increase cash provided by operations as we focused on controlling these levels 
days sales outstanding for accounts receivables improved from days as of april  to days as of april  in addition  days of inventory outstanding also improved by three days 
days outstanding for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings remained flat year over year 
overall  changes in operating assets and liabilities can be impacted by the timing of cash flows on large orders as noted above that can cause significant fluctuations in the short term 
as a result of various initiatives underway  including changes in manufacturing  purchasing  collections and payment processes  we expect to continue improving our cash flow relative to sales and costs of goods 
cash used by investing activities in fiscal included million used to purchase property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we invested in excess of million in facilities  primarily our new headquarters in brookings  south dakota  which we occupied in september   approximately million in manufacturing equipment  of which more than million related to equipment to complete the redwood falls  minnesota facility  approximately million on information systems hardware and software  and  approximately million in demonstration equipment 
these purchases were made to support our continued growth  finance plant expansions in redwood falls  minnesota and sioux falls  south dakota and to replace obsolete equipment 
other cash provided by investing activities included million in proceeds resulting from sales of equity method investments and million from the sale of fixed assets 
we expect that capital expenditures will exceed million in fiscal year cash used in financing activities of approximately million in fiscal included million in payments under our main credit facility  million of payments of long term debt  and million paid to shareholders in the form of a dividend  offset by million received for option exercises 
included in receivables as of april  was approximately million of retainage on construction type contracts  all of which is expected to be collected in one year 
we have used and expect to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  bank borrowings to meet our short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
our product development activities include the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products from existing technologies 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we intend to continue to incur these expenditures to develop new display products and solutions using various technologies to offer higher resolution and more cost effective and energy efficient displays  as well as to complement the services and solutions that are provided with the displays 
we also intend to continue developing software applications related to our display systems to enable these products to continue to meet the needs and expectations of the marketplace 
we have a credit agreement with a bank which provides for a million line of credit and includes up to million for standby letters of credit 
the line of credit is due on november  the interest rate ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on certain ratios 
the effective interest rate was at april  starting january   we are assessed a loan fee equal to per annum of any non used portion of the loan 
as of april   no advances under the line of credit were outstanding 
the credit agreement is unsecured and requires us to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of tangible net worth of at least million  a minimum liquidity ratio  a limit on dividends and distributions and a minimum adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio 
daktronics canada  inc has a credit agreement with a bank which provides for a million line of credit 
the line of credit is due on february  the interest rate on the line of credit is equal to above the prime rate of interest and was at april  as of april   no advances under the line of credit were outstanding 
the line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivables  inventory and other assets of the subsidiary 
we are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations 
we currently have a bonding line available through a surety company that provides for an aggregate of million in bonded work outstanding 
at april   we had approximately million of bonded work outstanding against this line 
we believe that if our growth extends beyond current expectations or if we make any strategic investments  we may need to increase the amount of our credit facility or seek other means of financing our growth 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lender or other sources 
we believe that our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we enter into various debt  lease  purchase and marketing obligations that require payments in future periods 
debt obligations represent primarily bank loans 
operating lease obligations relate primarily to leased office space and furniture 
long term marketing obligations relate to payment due in future periods for payments on sales where we sold and installed our equipment in exchange for future advertising revenue 
when certain advertising revenue thresholds are met  all or a portion of excess cash is owed back to the customer 
unconditional purchase obligations represent future payments for inventory and advertising rights purchase commitments 
as of april   our debt  lease and purchase obligations were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years cash commitments long term debt and accrued interest long term marketing obligations and accrued interest operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or our financial condition  although it could in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april   most of our net sales were denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has not been significant 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal year were approximately of total net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars  euros  chinese renminbi or british pounds 
in fiscal year  net sales to international markets are expected to increase as a percentage of net sales and  consequently  a greater portion of this business could be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  we fund operating cash to foreign subsidiaries in the form of loans denominated in us dollars 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we will continue to monitor and minimize our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect our financial results in the future 
during fiscal year  the us dollar has been generally weaker throughout the year relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate 
the overall weakness of the us dollar had a positive impact on our international business unit s revenue and net earnings because the foreign denominations translated into more us dollars 
this has also translated to net gains on advances made by us to our foreign subsidiaries 
it is not possible to determine the exact impact of foreign current exchange rate changes on net sales 
however  if there were to be a additional weakening of the us dollar as compared to all other currencies  we would gain an additional million 
interest rate risks our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and long term accounts receivable 
we maintain a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of april   our outstanding debt was million  substantially all of which was in fixed rate obligations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant annual effect on variable rate debt based on the balances of such debt as of april  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect our fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of certain display systems  we have entered into various types of financing orders with customers 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element 
the majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest 
as of april   our outstanding long term receivables were million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
the following table provides maturities and weighted average interest rates on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
fiscal years dollars in thousands there after assets long term receivables  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate liabilities long and short term debt fixed rate average interest rate long term marketing obligations  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet for long term receivables and long and short term debt approximate their fair values 
approximately million of our cash balances are denominated in united states dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances maintained in accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
a portion of the cash held in foreign accounts is used to collateralize outstanding bank guarantees issued by the foreign subsidiary
