in quebec  our annual allowable softwood harvesting amounts to approximately million cubic meters and is granted by the ministry of natural resources quebec 
we obtain most of the wood fiber required for our northern quebec sawmilling operations either directly or indirectly from these harvesting rights 
additional information regarding wood fiber availability in quebec is included in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k  under the caption fiber supply 
in ontario  our annual allowable softwood harvesting on public lands amounts to approximately million cubic meters pursuant to sustainable forest licenses that have been granted by the ontario ministry of natural resources 
we obtain most of the wood fiber required for our northern ontario sawmilling operations either directly or indirectly from these harvesting rights 
the remaining required fiber is either harvested from our private lands  or purchased under various contractual arrangements and on the open market 
all wood fiber received by domtar mills must conform to domtar s fiber use and sourcing policy  which forbids the inclusion of fiber that is illegally harvested  derived from improperly managed high conservation value forests  harvested without respect for aboriginal communities  or is genetically engineered 
further  of domtar s ontario and quebec timber supply area is currently third party certified  with of the total supply area certified to the forestry stewardship council fsc standards 
domtar s goal is to reach certification of all lands under its control by the fsc  and to have all of its wood suppliers conform to the fsc controlled wood standard 
energy our wood operations require the use of two types of energy electric energy is used to operate our manufacturing machinery and fossil fuel is used for the drying of wood 
the type of fossil fuel used to dry the wood varies among our sawmills and depends on the technology available 
some of our assets operate with energy produced through residual products such as bark  sawdust and shavings 
the use of our own products in the production of energy results in lower energy costs 
in other sawmills  we use fuel oil  natural gas and propane 
our product offering and go to market strategy we produce primarily dimensional lumber used in the construction industry and our offerings include a variety of grades of kiln dried softwood lumber  produced mainly from black spruce and jack pine known for their strength  stability  light weight and good workability 
most of our production capacity is used to produce studs and random length lumber in dimensions of inches by inches through inches by inches in lengths of feet to feet 
we also manufacture quality and wood  utility quality wood  economic wood as well as rough wood that we sell green and dried 
we also manufacture a wide variety of value added products including msr  msr  premium  select and mid line 
we sell substantially all of our softwood lumber through our sales office in montreal to a wide range of retailers  distributors  manufacturers and wholesalers in the united states and canada who sell to end users 
these wood products are consumed in the home construction  renovation and industrial markets 
our marketing efforts for lumber products are focused on providing our customers with efficient value added supply chain integration  in order to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction and a balanced and diversified customer base for our products 
in  approximately of our lumber sales were made in the united states and were made in canada 
our ten biggest clients represented approximately of our sales in none of these clients represented or more of our total sales in our competitive strengths we believe that our competitive strengths provide a solid foundation for the execution of our business strategy leading market position 
we are the largest integrated manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet paper in north america and the second largest in the world based on production capacity 
this leading market position provides us with key competitive advantages  including economies of scale  wider sales and marketing coverage and a broad product offering  such as business  printing and publishing and converting and specialty paper grades 
efficient and cost competitive assets 
our papers business is comprised of a mix of assets which allow us to be a low cost producer of high volume papers and an efficient producer of value added specialty papers 
our six largest mills focus on production of high volume copy and offset papers while the others focus on the production of value added paper products where quality  flexibility and service are key determinants 
most of our paper production is at mills with integrated pulp production and cogeneration facilities  reducing their exposure to price volatility for purchased pulp and energy 
proximity to customers 
we have a broad distribution and manufacturing footprint completed by converting and distribution operations located across north america 
this proximity to customers provides opportunities for enhanced customer service and the minimization of freight distance  response time and delivery cost  which constitute key competitive advantages  particularly in the high volume copy and offset paper grades market segment 
customer proximity also allows for just in time delivery of high demand paper products in less than hours to most major north american cities 
strong franchise with attractive service solutions 
we sell paper to multiple market segments through a variety of channels  including paper merchants  converters  retail companies and publishers throughout north america 
in addition  we maintain a strong market presence through our ownership of the domtar distribution group 
we will build on those positions by maximizing our strengths with centralized planning capability and supply chain management solutions 
high quality products with strong brand recognition 
we enjoy a strong reputation for producing high quality paper products and market some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  including a wide range of business and commercial printing paper brands  such as cougar  lynx opaque  husky offset  first choice  and domtar earthchoice office paper  part of a family of environmentally and socially responsible paper 
experienced management team with proven integration expertise 
our management team has significant experience and a record of success in the north american paper industry  including with respect to business integration issues 
to support the management team  we believe our employees expertise and know how help create operational efficiencies and enable us to deliver improved profitability from our manufacturing operations 
our strategic initiatives and financial priorities our goal is to be recognized as the supplier of choice of branded and private branded paper products for consumer channels  stationers  merchants  printers and converters in north america 
we have implemented the following business strategies in order to enhance cash flow and generate shareholder value build customer loyalty and balance supply with demand  successfully integrate the combined businesses and optimize the operating platform  increase depth of product offerings including our offering of environmentally and ethically responsible line of papers  deliver on synergies  focus on free cash flow generation and maintain financial discipline  and conduct operations in a sustainable way 
build customer loyalty and balance supply and demand 
we are building on the successful relationships that the predecessor and domtar inc have developed with key customers to support their businesses and to provide inventory reduction solutions through just in time delivery for the most demanded products 
we believe that we are a supplier of choice for customers who seek competitively priced paper products and services 
successfully integrate the combined businesses and optimize the operating platform 
we believe that the combination of the predecessor and domtar inc represents a strategic fit because of the similarity of both their fine paper offerings in uncoated freesheet grades and their geographic presence 
our integration efforts have been focused on providing a single face to our customers  utilizing our greater sales and marketing coverage to enhance customer service  and achieving synergies 
the combination provides an opportunity to combine the operational strengths and best practices of two of the industry s leading manufacturers 
we are implementing plans to improve our operating efficiency and cost structure and to achieve synergies within two years through a combination of process optimization resulting in lower operating costs  reductions in transportation  logistics and purchasing costs  implementation of best in class business practices and reductions in sales and administrative costs 
we are also optimizing our distribution network  reviewing our organizational structure and consolidating our regional centers and back office functions where appropriate 
increase depth of product offering including our offering of environmentally and ethically responsible line of papers 
we believe that we are delivering improved service to customers through increased depth of product offerings and greater access to volume 
we believe the development of earthchoice  our line of environmentally and socially responsible paper  is providing a platform upon which to expand our offerings to customers 
the earthchoice line of papers  a product line endorsed and supported by leading environmental groups  offers customers solutions and peace of mind through the use of a combination of forest stewardship council fsc virgin fiber and recycled fiber 
fsc is the certification recognized by environmental groups as the most stringent and is third party audited 
deliver on synergies 
we have targeted million of synergies from the transaction to be achieved by the end of march there are more than synergy projects covering best in class practices  selling  general and administration  transportation and logistics  process optimization  procurement and maintenance 
given the success to date  we are optimistic that we will exceed our synergy goal of million run rate by the end of fiscal year focus on free cash flow generation and maintain financial discipline 
we believe that value creation is achieved by operating our assets efficiently and reducing manufacturing costs while managing our capital expenditures effectively and minimizing working capital requirements to generate free cash flow 
conduct operations in a sustainable way 
customers and end users as well as all stakeholders in communities where we operate seek assurances from the pulp and paper industry that resources are managed in a sustainable manner 
we strive to provide these assurances by certifying our forest  manufacturing and distribution operations and we intend to subscribe to internationally recognized environmental management systems  namely iso our competition the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well established domestic and foreign manufacturers 
in the papers business  our paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas  except in highly specialized papers or customized products 
in order to gain market share in uncoated freesheet  we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  breadth of offering  service solutions and competitively priced paper products 
we seek product differentiation through an extensive offering of high quality fsc certified paper products 
while we have a leading position in the north american uncoated freesheet market  we also compete with other paper grades  including coated freesheet and uncoated groundwood  and with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives 
as the use of these alternative products continues to grow  we may see a decrease in the overall demand for paper products or shifts from one type of paper to another 
all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states or in canada where we sell of our papers 
the five largest manufacturers of uncoated freesheet papers in north america own approximately of the total production capacity 
on a global basis  there are hundreds of manufacturers that produce and sell uncoated freesheet papers  ten of which have an annual production capacity of over million tons 
the level of competitive pressures from foreign producers in the north american market is highly dependent upon exchange rates including the rate between the us dollar and the euro 
the market pulp we sell is either hardwood or softwood and  to a lesser extent  fluff pulp 
the pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide  some of whom have lower operating costs than we do 
competition is primarily on the basis of access to low cost wood fiber  product quality and prices 
the pulp we sell is primarily slow growth northern bleached hardwood and softwood kraft  and we produce specially engineered pulp grades with a pre determined mix of wood species that go into the making of all kinds of papers  from business to specialty papers 
we also seek product differentiation through the certification of our pulp mills to the fsc chain of custody standard and the procurement of fsc certified virgin fiber 
all of our market pulp production capacity is located in the united states or in canada and we sell of our pulp overseas 
in wood  we sell primarily kiln dried softwood lumber and other value added products 
we are the th largest producer of lumber in north america with a production capacity of mfbm and our competitors include other major lumber producers  most of which are located in eastern canada 
competition is primarily on the basis of access to low cost fiber  service and prices 
all of our lumber production capacity is located in canada and we sell of our lumber to the united states  resulting in an exposure to currency fluctuations and potentially subject to softwood lumber export taxes 
our employees we have approximately  employees  of which approximately are employed in the united states and in canada 
approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
our approach to sustainability we adopted our statement on sustainable growth to govern our pathway to sustainability  from excellence in corporate and ethical standards to product stewardship 
derived from our statement  we define our actions under our code of ethics  policies addressing health and safety  environment  forestry fiber procurement and others 
our environmental challenges our business is subject to a wide range of general and industry specific laws and regulations in the united states and canada relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the storage  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  contaminated sites  landfill operation and closure obligations and health and safety matters 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our business 
we may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable environmental requirements  possibly leading to civil or criminal fines  penalties or enforcement actions  including those that could result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs  such as the installation of additional pollution control equipment or other remedial actions 
compliance with us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial environmental laws and regulations involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency has promulgated regulations dealing with air emissions from pulp and paper mills  including regulations on hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology and controls for pollutants that contribute to smog and haze

unless specifically required by law  domtar corporation assumes no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
some of the following risks relate principally to the company s business and the industry in which it operates  while others relate principally to the transaction 
risks to the industries and businesses of the company the pulp  paper and wood product industries are highly cyclical 
fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for the company s products could result in smaller profit margins and lower sales volumes 
the pulp  paper and wood product industries are highly cyclical 
historically  economic and market shifts  fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices  sales volume and margins for the company s products 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product  but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
most of the company s paper products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 
even the company s non commodity products  such as value added papers  are susceptible to commodity dynamics 
because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer  competition for these products is based primarily on price  which is determined by supply relative to demand 
the overall levels of demand for the products the company manufactures and distributes  and consequently its sales and profitability  reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand  which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide  as well as competition from electronic substitution 
see some of the company s products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
for example  demand for cut size office paper may fluctuate with levels of white collar employment 
demand for many such products was materially and negatively impacted by the global economic downturn  among other things  in the early part of this decade  and the company expects that it will be susceptible to such downturns in the future 
industry supply of pulp  paper and wood products is also subject to fluctuation  as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills 
such closures can result in significant cash and or non cash charges 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short term pricing trends 
industry supply of pulp  paper and wood products is also influenced by overseas production capacity  which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow 
while the weakness of the us dollar has mitigated the levels of imports in recent years  imports of pulp  paper and wood products from overseas may increase  putting downward pressure on prices 
as a result  prices for all of the company s products are driven by many factors outside of its control  and it has little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond the company s control determine the prices for its commodity products  the price for any one or more of these products may fall below its cash production costs  requiring the company to either incur cash losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of its manufacturing facilities 
the company continues to evaluate potential adjustments to its production capacity  which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills  and the company could recognize significant cash and or non cash charges relating to any such closures in future periods 
therefore  the company s profitability with respect to these products depends on managing its cost structure  particularly wood fiber  chemical and energy costs  which represent the largest components of its operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond its control  as described below 
if the prices of or demand for its products decline  or if its wood fiber  chemical or energy costs increase  or both  its sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
some of the company s products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
the company s business competes with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives  as well as with paper grades it does not produce  such as uncoated groundwood 
as a result of such competition  the company has experienced decreased demand for some of its existing pulp and paper products 
as the use of these alternatives grows  demand for pulp and paper products is likely to further decline 
moreover  demand for some of the company s wood products may decline if customers purchase alternatives products 
the company faces intense competition in its markets  and the failure to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company competes with both us and canadian paper producers and  for many of its product lines  global producers  some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than the company 
the principal basis for competition is selling price 
the company s ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on its ability to control its costs 
the company cannot assure you that it can compete effectively and maintain current levels of sales and profitability 
if the company cannot compete effectively  such failure will have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of its products and its brands 
the company relies on patent  trademark  and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  the company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its respective intellectual property without its authorization  which may reduce any competitive advantage it has developed 
if the company had to litigate to protect these rights  any proceedings could be costly  and it may not prevail 
the company cannot guarantee that any united states or foreign patents  issued or pending  will provide it with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties 
additionally  the company has obtained and applied for united states and foreign trademark registrations  and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks  as appropriate 
the company cannot guarantee that any of its pending patent or trademark applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities and  even if the applications are approved  third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations 
the failure to secure any pending patent or trademark applications may limit the company s ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 
the company s manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining wood fiber at favorable prices  or at all 
wood fiber is the principal raw material used by the company  comprising approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales during wood fiber is a commodity  and prices historically have been cyclical 
the primary source for wood fiber is timber 
environmental litigation and regulatory developments have caused  and may cause in the future  significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in the united states and canada 
in addition  future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands  the protection of endangered species  the promotion of forest health and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires could also affect timber supplies 
availability of harvested timber maybe further limited by fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding and other natural and man made causes  thereby reducing supply and increasing prices 
wood fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences  and the company s cost of wood fiber may increase in particular regions due to market shifts in those regions 
any sustained increase in wood fiber prices would increase the company s operating costs  and the company may be unable to increase prices for its products in response to increased wood fiber costs due to additional factors affecting the demand or supply of these products 
the province of quebec adopted legislation  which became effective april   that reduced allowable wood harvesting volumes by an average of on public lands and on territories covered by an agreement between the government of quebec and the cree first nations 
as a result  the amount of fiber  primarily softwood fiber  the company is permitted to harvest annually  under its existing licenses from the quebec government  was reduced by approximately  cubic meters to approximately million cubic meters  reflecting a reduction 
the chief forester of quebec has proposed a further reduction of  cubic meters  or  of the total softwood annual allowable cut of forests managed by the company 
the reduction will be effective from april to march and would significantly affect the supply of fiber for the company s northern quebec softwood sawmill and market pulp operations 
in addition  on october  domtar inc received written notice from the minister of natural resources and wildlife for the province of quebec purporting to revoke  effective september   domtar inc s forest license rights relating to its grand remous and malartic sawmills representing approximately  cubic meters of fiber on an annual basis 
while we are currently seeking the reinstatement of these license rights through formal legal proceedings  there is no assurance that we will be successful and we may lose these forest license rights permanently 
the reduction in harvest volume would also result in a corresponding increase in the unit cost of wood delivered to the sawmills 
in addition  as a result of the impact of the strength of the canadian dollar against the us dollar  low lumber prices and other factors  a significant portion of the company s wood fiber harvesting operations in quebec have been shut down and all but two  val d or and matagami  of the facilities related to such operations have been closed indefinitely 
as a result of the reduced availability  the company may face increased costs in purchasing  and have difficulty locating wood fiber sufficient to satisfy its requirements 
historically  weyerhaeuser provided  on average  approximately of the weyerhaeuser fine paper business wood fiber requirements  which is approximately of the company s wood fiber requirements 
the company currently obtains its wood fiber requirements in part by harvesting timber pursuant to its forest licenses and forest management agreements  in part by purchasing wood fiber from weyerhaeuser pursuant to the fiber and pulp supply agreements entered into in connection with the transaction  which expire between and  and in part by purchasing wood fiber from third parties 
if the company s cutting rights  pursuant to its forest licenses or forest management agreements  are reduced or if weyerhaeuser or any third party supplier of wood fiber stops selling or is unable to sell wood fiber to the company  its financial condition and operating could be materially and adversely affected 
an increase in the cost of the company s purchased energy or chemicals would lead to higher manufacturing costs  thereby reducing its margins 
the company s operations consume substantial amounts of energy such as electricity  natural gas  fuel oil  coal and hog fuel 
energy comprised approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales in energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas and fuel oil  have been volatile in recent years and currently exceed historical averages 
as a result  fluctuations in energy prices will impact the company s manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
while the company purchases substantial portions of its energy under supply contracts  many of these contracts are based on market pricing 
other raw materials the company uses include various chemical compounds  such as precipitated calcium carbonate  sodium chlorate and sodium hydroxide  sulfuric acid  dyes  peroxide  methanol and aluminum sulfate 
purchases of chemicals comprised approximately of the aggregate amount of cost of sales in the costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically  and are influenced by capacity utilization  energy prices and other factors beyond the company s control 
chemical prices have been increasing although the impact has been partially mitigated by long term purchasing contracts that reflect our increased purchasing power 
due to the commodity nature of the company s products  the relationship between industry supply and demand for these products  rather than changes in the cost of raw materials  will determine the company s ability to increase prices 
consequently  the company may be unable to pass on increases in its operating costs to its customers 
any sustained increase in chemical or energy prices without any corresponding increase in product pricing would reduce the company s operating margins and potentially require it to limit or cease operations of one or more of its machines 
the company could experience disruptions in operations and or increased labor costs due to labor disputes 
employees at of the company s facilities  a majority of the company s  employees  are represented by unions through collective bargaining agreements  generally on a facility by facility basis  which will expire between and currently six collective bargaining agreements are up for renegotiation of which only three are currently under negotiation 
the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements  which could result in strikes or work stoppages or other labor disputes by affected workers 
renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
in addition  labor organizing activities could occur at any of the company s facilities 
therefore  the company could experience a disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
in connection with the company s restructuring efforts  the company has suspended operations at  or closed or announced its intention to close  various facilities and may incur liability with respect to affected employees  which could have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate potential adjustments to its production capacity  which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills  and the company could recognize significant cash and or non cash charges relating to any such closures in the future 
in the early part of  weyerhaeuser closed its pulp and paper mill in prince albert  saskatchewan  which the company acquired in the transaction  which remains closed 
certain unionized parties filed a grievance against weyerhaeuser following the shut down  alleging that certain post closure actions taken by weyerhaeuser violated their collective bargaining agreement 
in particular  the union disputed weyerhaeuser s post closure contracting with a third party vendor to oversee on site security at prince albert 
in connection with the transaction  the company has assumed any liability with respect to this grievance 
in november  the company was informed that the government of saskatchewan was not prepared to participate in the financing and redevelopment of the prince albert facility into a northern bleached softwood kraft pulp mill producing forest stewardship council fsc certified softwood pulp for the north america and offshore markets  as set forth in the memorandum of understanding signed on september  as such  the company has not determined whether this facility will be reopened  sold or closed 
in a separate grievance related to the closure of the prince albert facility  which could result in liability in excess of million  the union is claiming that it is entitled to the accumulated pension benefits during the actual layoff period because  according to the union  a majority of employees retained still had recall rights during the layoff 
the company is currently evaluating its position with respect to these grievances and cannot be certain that it will not incur liability  which could be material  with respect to these grievances 
the company relies heavily on a small number of significant customers  including one customer that represented approximately of the company s sales in a loss of any of these significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company heavily relies on a small number of significant customers 
the company s largest customer is office depot 
office depot was historically a major customer of the weyerhaeuser fine paper business and willamette industries 
a significant reduction in sales to any of the company s key customers  including office depot which could be due to factors outside its control  such as purchasing diversification or financial difficulties experienced by these customers  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
a material disruption at one of the company s manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand  reduce its sales and or negatively impact its net income 
any of the company s pulp or paper manufacturing facilities  or any of its machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  equipment failure  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply  labor difficulties  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes or other catastrophes  terrorism or threats of terrorism  or other operational problems  including those resulting from the risks described in this section 
events such as those listed above have resulted in operating losses in the past 
in may  the weyerhaeuser fine paper business facilities in plymouth  north carolina experienced a disruption in their power supply  causing damage to a turbine generator necessary to convert high pressure steam to medium and low pressure steam used by the various mill processes 
as a result of this damage  various mill operations at the weyerhaeuser fine paper business s plymouth facilities were shut down for repairs for up to eleven days 
the company estimates the total financial impact of this incident on its operating income was million including repair costs  the opportunity value of lost production and increased operating costs 
future events may cause similar shutdowns  which may result in additional downtime and or cause additional damage to the company s facilities 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent the company from meeting customer demand for its products and or require it to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime  the company s ability to meet its production targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired  resulting in lower sales and income 
the company s operations require substantial capital  and it may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of its capital requirements 
the company s businesses are capital intensive and require that it regularly incur capital expenditures in order to maintain its equipment  increase its operating efficiency and comply with environmental laws 
in  the company s total capital expenditures were approximately million  including approximately million for maintenance capital and approximately million for environmental expenditures 
the company s total capital expenditures in were approximately million  including approximately million for maintenance capital and approximately million for environmental expenditures 
if the company s available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund its operating needs and capital expenditures  the company would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay its capital expenditures 
the company may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  the company s debt service obligations will reduce its available cash flows 
if the company cannot maintain or upgrade its equipment as it requires or allocate funds to ensure environmental compliance  it could be required to curtail or cease some of its manufacturing operations  or it may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively in one or more of its product lines 
the company could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with  violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations 
it could also incur costs as a result of asbestos related personal injury litigation 
the company is subject  in both the united states and canada  to a wide range of general and industry specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  harvesting  silvicultural activities  the storage  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  landfill operation and closure obligations  forestry operations and endangered species habitat  and health and safety matters 
in particular  the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to the united states environmental protection agency s epa cluster rule and was until recently subject to the epa s boiler mact rule the boiler mact rule has been vacated  however  alternative us federal and state regulations are being discussed that further regulate effluent and air emissions 
these laws and regulations require the company to obtain authorizations from and comply with the requirements of the appropriate governmental authorities  which have considerable discretion over the terms and timing of permits 
the company has incurred  and expects that it will continue to incur  significant capital  operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations as a result of remedial obligations 
the company incurred approximately million of operating expenses and million of capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance and remediation for as of december   the company had a provision of million for environmental expenditures  including certain asset retirement obligations such as for land fill capping and asbestos removal 
in addition  during the first half of  the company closed its pulp and paper mill in prince albert  saskatchewan and the big river sawmill in saskatchewan 
the company has not determined whether either of these facilities will be reopened  sold or permanently closed 
in the event the facilities are permanently closed  the province of saskatchewan may require active decommissioning and reclamation at one or both facilities  which would likely include investigation and remedial action for areas of significant environmental impacts 
the province of saskatchewan has required certain facilities located in the province to submit preliminary decommissioning and reclamation plans and to include in such plans estimates of costs associated with decommissioning and reclamation activities 
weyerhaeuser submitted such a plan for its pulp and paper facility in prince albert  saskatchewan 
in its preliminary decommissioning and reclamation plan  weyerhaeuser included a preliminary  generalized estimate of costs ranging from cdn to cdn million approximately to million 
weyerhaeuser advised the province of saskatchewan that it was not providing a detailed delineation of costs at this time because such costs will depend on site specific factors  the professional judgments of environmental specialists and experts  further detailed environmental site assessments  and most fundamentally  a decision about the future use or closure of the site 
the estimate referred to above does not take into account the equipment resale value or scrap material value which is considered to be significant  nor does it include the cost of completing a phase ii environmental site assessment which could involve sampling and analysis of building materials and environmental media  or the cost of any remediation required based on such assessment 
the company has not undertaken an in depth review of weyerhaeuser s estimate and the net decommissioning and reclamation costs could exceed weyerhaeuser s estimate 
the company also could incur substantial costs  such as civil or criminal fines  sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting its operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions  cleanup and closure costs  and third party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
the company s ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with its past and present properties will lead to future environmental investigations 
those efforts will likely result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
as the owner and operator of real estate  the company may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup  closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances  including asbestos  on or from its properties or operations 
the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict  and  in some cases  the company s liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether it knew of  or caused  the release of hazardous substances and may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself 
the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at the company s or third party sites may result in significant additional costs 
any material liability the company incurs could adversely impact its financial condition or preclude it from making capital expenditures that would otherwise benefit its business 
in addition  the company may be subject to asbestos related personal injury litigation arising out of exposure to asbestos on or from its properties or operations  and may incur substantial costs as a result of any defense  settlement  or adverse judgment in such litigation 
the company may not have access to insurance proceeds to cover costs associated with asbestos related personal injury litigation 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations  or interpretation thereof  might require significant expenditures 
the company may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund environmental liabilities or expenditures 
the company is affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures a significant amount of pulp and paper in canada 
sales of pulp and paper products by the company s canadian mills will be invoiced in us dollars or in canadian dollars linked to us pricing but most of the costs relating to these products will be incurred in canadian dollars 
as a result  any decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar will reduce the company s profitability 
exchange rate fluctuations are beyond the company s control 
since january   the canadian dollar has appreciated more than relative to the us dollar 
this has had a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of the canadian operations of both the predecessor and domtar inc and is continuing to have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial results and financial condition 
the company may be required to pay significant lumber export taxes and or countervailing and antidumping duties 
the company may experience reduced revenues and margins on its softwood lumber business as a result of lumber export taxes and or countervailing and antidumping duty applications 
in april  the coalition for fair lumber imports coalition filed two petitions with the us department of commerce department and the international trade commission itc claiming that production of softwood lumber in canada was being subsidized by canada and that imports from canada were being dumped into the us market sold at less than fair value 
the coalition asked that countervailing duty cvd and antidumping ad tariffs be imposed on softwood lumber imported from canada 
in  the canadian and us governments reached a final settlement to this long standing dispute 
the provisions of the settlement included repayment of approximately of the deposits  imposition of export measures in canada  and measures to address long term policy reform 
it is possible that the cvd and ad tariffs or tariffs similar to the cvd and ad tariffs may again be imposed on the company  in the future 
under the settlement agreement  canadian softwood lumber exporters pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price 
under present market conditions  the company s softwood lumber exports are subject to a export charge plus a market restriction on access managed by a quota system 
the company experienced and may continue to experience reduced revenues and margins in the softwood lumber business as a result of the application of the settlement agreement 
the settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial results and financial condition  including  but not limited to  facility closures or impairment of assets 
the company depends on third parties for transportation services 
the company relies primarily on third parties for transportation of the products it manufactures and or distributes  as well as delivery of its raw materials 
in particular  a significant portion of the goods it manufactures and raw materials it uses are transported by railroad or trucks  which are highly regulated 
if any of its third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods the company manufactures or distributes in a timely manner  the company may be unable to sell those products at full value  or at all 
similarly  if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to the company in a timely manner  it may be unable to manufacture its products in response to customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with the company  it may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm the company s reputation  negatively impact its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results 
the transition services provided by weyerhaeuser may be difficult for the company to replace without operational problems and additional costs 
the company entered into a transition services agreement with weyerhaeuser pursuant to which weyerhaeuser agreed to provide the company certain transition services for a period of time following the closing date 
these services include  among others  certain services relating to finance and administration  human resources  payroll and information technology 
if  after the expiration of the agreement  the company is unable to perform these services or replace them in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those the company receives from weyerhaeuser  the company may experience operational problems and an increase in its costs 
in addition  the cost for such services may be higher than the cost for such services when the weyerhaeuser fine paper business was operated as part of weyerhaeuser 
see risks related to the transaction the historical financial information of the predecessor may not be representative of its results if the weyerhaeuser fine paper business had been operated independently of weyerhaeuser and  as a result  may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 
at december   the transition services agreement for both human resources and payroll services as well as finance and administration had been terminated as all activities related to those agreements had been successfully transferred to the company 
as a result of the separation of the weyerhaeuser fine paper business from weyerhaeuser  the company may experience increased costs resulting from decreased purchasing power  which could decrease its overall profitability 
prior to its separation from weyerhaeuser  the predecessor was able to take advantage of weyerhaeuser s size and reputation in procuring raw materials and other goods and services used both for the predecessor and weyerhaeuser s other businesses 
as an independent public company  the company may be unable to obtain similar goods  services and technology at prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained by the predecessor prior to its separation from weyerhaeuser 
the company has liabilities with respect to its pension plans and the actual cost of its pension plan obligations could exceed current provisions 
as of december   the company s defined benefit plans had a surplus of million on certain plans and a deficit of million on others on a ongoing basis 
the company s future funding obligations for the defined benefit pension plans depend upon changes to the level of benefits provided by the plans  the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans  the level of interest rates used to determine minimum funding levels  actuarial data and experience  and any changes in government laws and regulations 
as of december   the company s canadian defined benefit pension funds had approximately cdn  million approximately  million of assets  of which approximately cdn million approximately million is held by domtar inc s canadian pension funds  invested in multiple third party asset backed commercial paper abcp conduits  which are currently subject to restructuring or repayment delay  and of which cdn million approximately million is subject to the interim arrangement of the montreal proposal pursuant to which banks and major investors are negotiating restructuring proposals with respect to certain abcp conduits  however  these discussions are not finalized  and the outcome and the effect it would have on the value of the company s canadian pension fund assets has yet to be determined 
losses in the pension fund investments  if any  would result in future increased contributions by the company or its canadian subsidiaries 
additional contributions to these pension funds would be required to be paid over a year period 
losses  if any  would also impact operating results over a longer period of time and immediately increase liabilities and reduce equity 
risks related to the transaction the company may not realize anticipated synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities from the transaction 
the success of the transaction depends  in part  on the company s ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the weyerhaeuser fine paper business with the domtar inc business 
the company s success in realizing these synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities  and the timing of this realization  depends on the successful integration of such businesses and operations 
even if the company is able to integrate such businesses and operations successfully  there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities that the company expects from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
for example  the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated  or the benefits from the transaction may be offset by the loss of weyerhaeuser s purchasing power or the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations 
the company incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs related to the transaction that could have a material adverse effect on its operating results 
the company incurred financial  legal and accounting costs and sales and transfer taxes in connection with the transaction 
in addition  the company estimates that it will incur costs in connection with the separation of the weyerhaeuser fine paper business from weyerhaeuser 
the company also anticipates that it will incur significant costs in connection with the integration of the weyerhaeuser fine paper business and the domtar inc business  including  among other things  costs relating to information technology integration  severance costs and the potential write down of assets  which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
these costs may have a material adverse effect on the company s cash flows and operating results in the periods in which they are recorded 
the historical financial information of the predecessor may not be representative of its results if the weyerhaeuser fine paper business had been operated independently of weyerhaeuser and  as a result  may not be a reliable indicator of its future results 
prior to the closing date  the predecessor was a fully integrated business unit of weyerhaeuser 
consequently  the financial information of the predecessor included in this document has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of weyerhaeuser and reflects assumptions and allocations made by weyerhaeuser 
the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the predecessor presented may be different from those that would have resulted had the predecessor been operated independently 
for example  in preparing the predecessor financial statements  weyerhaeuser has made an appropriate allocation of costs and expenses that are attributable to the predecessor 
however  these costs and expenses reflect the costs and expenses attributable to the predecessor operated as part of a larger organization and do not reflect costs and expenses that would be incurred by this business had it been operated independently 
as a result  the historical financial information of the predecessor may not be a reliable indicator of future results 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial condition 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
management of the company identified the following material weaknesses as of april   which were remediated as of december  the company did not maintain effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of financial information produced under the transition services agreement with weyerhaeuser 
specifically  the company did not have controls designed and in place to ensure that financial data regarding the predecessor was complete  accurate  produced on a timely basis and supported with appropriate documentation 
further  the company did not maintain an appropriate accounting and financial reporting organizational structure  specifically relating to the depth of resources  to be able to ensure that the accounting records being maintained by weyerhaeuser under the transition services agreement were accurate and complete 
the financial data produced under the transition services agreement affects substantially all balance sheet and income statement accounts 
these control deficiencies resulted in adjustments to the interim financial statements as of and for the thirteen week period ended april  and a delay in the filing of the quarterly report on form q for that period 
aboriginal interests may delay or result in challenges to the transfer of certain forest licenses and forest management agreements 
under applicable forestry legislation in saskatchewan  weyerhaeuser must obtain consent from the government of saskatchewan in order to complete the transfer of certain timber rights in saskatchewan to the company 
pursuant to the agreements governing the transaction  the transfer of these timber rights were delayed until the appropriate approvals are received 
recent supreme court of canada decisions have confirmed that the federal and provincial governments in canada have a duty to consult with  and in certain circumstances  seek to accommodate aboriginal groups whenever there is a reasonable prospect that a government s decision may adversely affect an aboriginal group s interests in relevant land and resources that are the subject of the decision 
the company believes that the government of saskatchewan has consulted with relevant aboriginal groups in connection with these consent approvals 
this consultation process could result in delays  constrain access to the timber or give rise to additional costs 
in addition  if the government of saskatchewan does not adequately discharge its obligation this could result in litigation 
it is not possible at present to predict the risks associated with such litigation 
if the distribution by weyerhaeuser of its shares of company common stock to the holders of weyerhaeuser common shares and weyerhaeuser exchangeable shares pursuant to an exchange offer distribution did not constitute a tax free transaction  either as a result of actions taken in connection with the distribution or as a result of subsequent acquisitions of shares of company common stock  then the company may be responsible for payment of substantial us federal income taxes under its tax sharing agreement with weyerhaeuser 
weyerhaeuser received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service on february  to the effect that  based on the facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings set forth in the ruling  the contribution and distribution qualified as tax free to weyerhaeuser and the holders of weyerhaeuser common shares for us federal income tax purposes under sections and and related provisions of the code 
the distribution would become taxable to weyerhaeuser pursuant to section e of the code if or more by vote or value of equity securities of the company were acquired  directly or indirectly  by persons other than weyerhaeuser shareholders as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution 
because weyerhaeuser shareholders owned more than of company common stock following the arrangement  the arrangement  by itself  would not have caused the distribution to be taxable to weyerhaeuser under section e of the code 
however  if the irs were to determine that other acquisitions of company equity securities  either before or after the distribution and the arrangement  were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the distribution such determination could result in the recognition of a gain by weyerhaeuser under section e of the code 
in such case  the gain recognized by weyerhaeuser likely would include the entire fair market value of the company common stock distributed to weyerhaeuser s shareholders  and thus would be substantial 
under the tax sharing agreement among weyerhaeuser  the company  and domtar inc  the company generally would be required to indemnify weyerhaeuser against tax related losses to weyerhaeuser and or its shareholders that arise as a result of certain actions taken or omissions to act by the company  its subsidiaries or certain affiliates of the company disqualifying actions after the transaction 
see risks related to the transaction the company may be affected by significant restrictions following the transaction in order to avoid significant tax related liabilities 
the company may be affected by significant restrictions following the transaction in order to avoid significant tax related liabilities 
even if the distribution qualifies as a tax free reorganization  it may not qualify as a transaction that is tax free to weyerhaeuser if or more by vote or value of the equity securities of the company are acquired by persons other than weyerhaeuser shareholders as part of a plan that includes the distribution pursuant to section e of the code 
the tax sharing agreement requires that the company  its subsidiaries and certain affiliates of the company  for a two year period following the closing date  avoid taking certain actions that might cause the distribution to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which or more of the company s equity securities are acquired 
certain of these disqualifying actions subject to restrictions include the redemption  recapitalization  repurchase or acquisition by the company of its capital stock  the issuance by the company of capital stock or convertible debt  the liquidation of the company  the discontinuance of the operations of the predecessor  the sale or disposition other than in the ordinary course of business of all or a substantial part of the predecessor  or the other actions  omissions to act or transactions that could jeopardize the tax free status of the distribution 
to the extent that the tax free status of the distribution is lost because of a disqualifying action after the date of consummation of the transaction  the company generally will be required to indemnify  defend and hold harmless weyerhaeuser from and against any and all resulting tax related losses incurred by weyerhaeuser and or weyerhaeuser shareholders  without regard to whether weyerhaeuser gave the company prior written consent to the specific action taken by the company 
because of these restrictions  the company may be limited in its ability to pursue strategic transactions or equity or convertible debt financing or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business 
a third party has demanded an increase in consideration from domtar inc under an existing contract in connection with the transaction 
in  domtar inc acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of eb eddy limited and eb eddy paper  inc  an integrated producer of specialty paper and wood products 
the purchase agreement relating to this acquisition includes a purchase price adjustment whereby  in the event of the acquisition by a third party of more than of the shares of domtar inc in specified circumstances  domtar inc 
may be required to pay an increase in consideration of up to a maximum of cdn million approximately million 
this amount gradually declines over a year period and at march   the closing date  the maximum amount of the purchase price adjustment was cdn million approximately million 
no provision was recorded for this potential purchase price adjustment 
on march   domtar inc received a letter from george weston limited the previous owner of eb eddy and a party to the purchase agreement demanding payment of cdn million approximately million as a result of the consummation of the transaction 
on june   an action was commenced by george weston limited against domtar inc in the superior court of justice of the province of ontario  canada  claiming that the consummation of the transaction triggered the purchase price adjustment and seeking a purchase price adjustment of cdn million approximately million as well as additional compensatory damages 
the company and domtar inc does not believe that the consummation of the transaction triggers an obligation to pay an increase in consideration under the purchase price adjustment and it intends to defend itself vigorously against any claims with respect thereto 
however  the company may not be successful in its defense of such claims  and  if it is ultimately required to pay an increase in consideration  such payment may have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s substantial indebtedness  which is approximately billion as of december   could adversely affect its financial condition and impair its ability to operate its business 
as of december   the company had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness  including million of indebtedness under its senior secured credit facilities  million of capital leases and billion of unsecured long term notes 
the company s substantial degree of indebtedness could have important consequences to the company s financial condition  operating results and business  including the following it may limit the company s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  product development  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a substantial portion of the company s cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  the debt service requirements of the company s indebtedness could make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its other obligations  the company s borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest  exposing the company to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates  it may limit the company s ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt  and it may increase the company s vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in its business  and may make the company unable to carry out capital spending that is important to its growth 
despite current indebtedness levels  the company and its subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with its substantial leverage 
the company and its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although the credit agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
for example  as of december   the company had million drawn under its senior secured revolving credit facility and million of letters of credit outstanding  resulting in million of availability for future drawings under this facility 
other new borrowing could also be incurred by domtar corporation or its subsidiaries 
if the company incurs additional debt  the risks associated with its substantial leverage would increase 
the company s ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on the domtar corporation notes and service its other debt and financial obligations and its ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond the company s control 
the company has considerable debt service obligations 
the company s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt  including the domtar corporation debt securities and amounts borrowed under its senior secured credit facilities and other financial obligations and to fund its operations will depend on its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow 
the company s cash flow generation will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
the company business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to the company under its senior secured credit facilities or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness  including the domtar corporation notes  and borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the company cannot service its debt  the company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital 
any of these remedies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and may impede the implementation of its business strategy 
further  the credit agreement may restrict the company from adopting any of these alternatives 
in addition  the restrictions on the company s ability to issue equity securities or convertible debt securities during the two year period following the closing date without jeopardizing the intended tax consequences of the transaction may make it difficult for the company to raise equity capital if needed to service its indebtedness 
because of these and other factors that may be beyond its control  the company may be unable to pay the principal  premium  if any  interest or other amounts on the domtar corporation notes

thereto  dated july   the agreement between weston  weston investments inc  domtar inc

the claim seeks a payment of cdn million approximately million under the purchase price adjustment provision of the agreement and additional compensatory damages 
on august   domtar inc served its statement of defense in response to this claim 
neither the company nor domtar inc believes that the consummation of the transaction triggered an obligation to pay an increase in consideration under the purchase price adjustment and domtar inc intends to defend itself vigorously against any claims with respect thereto 
however  domtar inc may not be successful in its defense of such claims  and if it is ultimately required to pay an increase in consideration  such payment may have a material adverse effect on the company s and on domtar inc s liquidity  results of operations and financial condition

environment domtar inc and the company is or may be a potentially responsible party with respect to various hazardous waste sites that are being addressed pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of superfund or similar laws 
domtar inc continues to take remedial action under its care and control program  as such sites mostly relate to its former wood preserving operating sites  and a number of operating sites due to possible soil  sediment or groundwater contamination 
the investigation and remediation process is lengthy and subject to the uncertainties of changes in legal requirements  technological developments and  if and when applicable  the allocation of liability among potentially responsible parties 
an action was commenced by seaspan international ltd 
seaspan in the supreme court of british columbia  on march  against domtar inc and others with respect to alleged contamination of seaspan s site bordering burrard inlet in north vancouver  british columbia including contamination of sediments in burrard inlet  due to the presence of creosote 
as of july   the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement the settlement agreement which provides that while the agreement is performed in accordance with its terms  the action commenced by seaspan will be held in abeyance 
the settlement agreement focused on the sharing of costs between seaspan and domtar inc for certain remediation of contamination referred to in the plaintiff s claim 
the settlement agreement does not address all of the plaintiff s claims as that cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
due to the complexity in the implementation of the settlement  the parties are currently renegotiating the terms and conditions of the settlement 
no party has exercised its right to terminate the settlement

domtar inc was issued a request for response action rfra by the minnesota pollution control agency mpca for the clean up of tar seeps and soils at a former coal tar distillation plant located in duluth  minnesota 
on march   the mpca issued the rfra to domtar inc  interlake corp  allied signal  inc 
and beazer east  inc 
requiring the investigation and potential remediation of a portion of an industrial site located in duluth  minnesota  believed to contain contaminated sediments originating from former coke and gas plants and coal tar distillation plants 
domtar inc formerly operated one coal tar distillation plant at this site 
the total cost of the likely remediation for which domtar will remain responsible under the rfra is estimated to be between million and million 
under a final and binding arbitration process  an arbitration panel rendered  with respect to the allocation of responsibility between the potentially responsible parties  a decision on november  which is under review as per the rules of arbitration 
a decision is expected in the second quarter of the company has a provision of million at december  at december   the company had a provision of million for environmental matters and other asset retirement obligations 
additional costs  not known or identifiable  could be incurred for remediation efforts 
based on policies and procedures in place to monitor environmental exposure  management believes that such additional remediation costs would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  earnings or cash flows 
while the company believes that it has determined the cost for environmental matters likely to be incurred based on known information  their ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with their past and present properties will lead to future environmental investigations 
these efforts will likely result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities  which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
