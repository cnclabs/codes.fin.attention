for a more detailed description of our business  see item business of part i of this report 
we currently have two operating segments retail and direct 
we believe there is an opportunity for us to grow our premium retail store base to to stores in more than identified markets nationwide over the next three to five years 
in fiscal  we opened premium retail stores  increasing our total premium store count to  covering markets 
approximately percent of these stores are located in traditional malls  percent in lifestyle centers and five percent in street locations 
in addition to our premium retail stores we also had merchandise clearance outlets in operation at the end of fiscal we currently plan to open approximately premium retail stores during fiscal  nine of which are planned for opening in the first quarter  six in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
approximately percent of these new stores will be located in lifestyle centers  percent in traditional malls and two percent in street locations 
new premium retail stores will average approximately  square feet 
as of march   four stores have been opened in the first quarter of fiscal  for a premium retail total store count of though it is our present intention to open approximately new stores in fiscal  we do not maintain a specific rollout plan beyond a one year horizon 
we continually reassess store rollout plans based on the overall retail environment  the performance of the retail business  our access to working capital and external financing and the availability of suitable store locations 
for example  it is possible that in any year we will increase planned store openings  particularly if we experience strong retail sales and have access to the necessary working capital or external financing 
likewise  we would be inclined to curtail store rollout if we were to experience weaker retail sales or if we did not have adequate working capital or access to financing  or as a part of a cost containment initiative 
one of the primary vehicles for attracting new customers to the coldwater creek brand has been the placement of advertisements in national magazines 
these advertisements are designed to drive traffic and sales to all channels  while promoting a heightened awareness of the coldwater creek brand 
our investment in national magazine advertisements decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  we plan to spend approximately million related to our national branding campaign 
our merchandise is currently offered through three core catalog titles northcountry  spirit and coldwater creek 
in addition  we periodically distribute a holiday oriented gifts to go catalog 
we differentiate the merchandise assortment offered in each title to cater to the various lifestyles of our core customer 
approximately million catalogs were mailed in fiscal compared to the approximately million mailed in fiscal we currently plan to mail approximately million catalogs in fiscal in connection with our fiscal initiatives discussed below we made the decision to discontinue the spirit catalog in early fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we introduced the coldwater creek catalog 
this catalog differs from our other catalog titles in that it exclusively features merchandise available in our premium retail stores and is designed to encourage customers to shop at our stores 
as such  it is mailed into markets where a premium retail store is located 
the catalog supplements our other catalog titles  communicating with customers in between catalog mailings and notifying them of current promotions in the premium retail store 
during fiscal  we mailed approximately million coldwater creek catalogs compared to the million mailed during fiscal a contributing factor to this increase was our retail expansion which provided us with the opportunity to mail the coldwater creek catalog into additional markets 
in fiscal we plan to mail approximately million coldwater creek catalogs 
fiscal initiatives during fiscal we operated in a highly promotional retail selling environment accompanied by lower customer traffic and challenging macroeconomic conditions 
these conditions  together with what we believe was an over assortment of merchandise that did not differentiate us from our competitors  had a negative impact on our revenues  gross margins and earnings 
our efforts in fiscal will be focused on certain initiatives which we believe will continue to further our goal of becoming one of the premier specialty retailers for women years of age and older in the united states 
these key initiatives include increased focus on product and customer experience restoration of the full price heritage of the coldwater creek brand shift in marketing approach increased efficiency in the use of resources increased focus on product and customer experience our product and the customer experience are the foundation of all decision making at coldwater creek 
our highest priority is to improve our product as we believe that our success depends on having compelling product offerings for our customer 
we are committed to returning to the look and feel that the coldwater creek brand originally represented  rooted in the west  comfortable and casual  refocusing on quality  fit and consistency 
in connection with improving our product we are lowering our sku count by at least percent in order to provide a more focused and cohesive offering 
we believe that the sku reduction will allow us to focus our efforts towards fewer styles enabling us to better execute on our product offerings 
in addition to expanding our direct sourcing from percent to approximately percent in fiscal  we are also working towards reducing our retail inventories per square foot by an average of percent in fiscal restoration of the full price heritage of the coldwater creek brand we are committed to restoring the full price heritage to our brand by being more prudent with promotional activity and discounting 
specifically  we plan to limit the frequency  length  duration  and amount of our overall promotion cadence 
we expect to refine our promotional approach to feature fewer  but more targeted campaigns 
we believe that prudently managing our promotions and discounting  accompanied with lowering our sku count  reducing our retail inventories per square foot  and expanding our direct sourcing program  is critical to improving margins and returning to our full price heritage 
shift in marketing approach historically  we have used a broad based marketing strategy of national magazine advertising and increasing catalog circulation  with television advertising on a test basis 
we are now shifting to a more point of sale  in store focus 
our efforts will be focused on maintaining and better engaging our best customers  as well as attracting new customers through select advertising placement 
we believe this more focused approach will result in a reduction in our spending in by approximately million 
our more focused marketing approach will include a more selective use of national magazine advertising  catalog circulation including the coldwater creek catalog  e mail campaigns  and customer loyalty programs 
increased efficiency in the use of resources in addition to a more focused approach on marketing  we have carefully evaluated our entire organization to determine where we can improve operational efficiencies 
in january  we eliminated of our corporate support positions as a first step in executing on our initiatives for fiscal we believe our current personnel infrastructure will position us for sustained growth in the future 
there were no positions eliminated in the company s retail stores  distribution center or customer contact centers 
we are also continuing to improve various information technology tools and systems in order to enhance operating efficiency and enable our infrastructure to accommodate growth 
during fiscal  we continued activities to enhance or replace several fundamental systems  such as our inventory planning and allocation  financial and human resources systems 
during the second half of fiscal  we completed the initial implementation of our new financial and human resources systems 
in addition  we continue to make improvements in our distribution infrastructure  processes and technology in order to expedite the flow of merchandise through our distribution center with the goal of moving product more quickly to our direct customers and premium retail stores 
we believe that a successful execution on these initiatives will position ourselves into a strong competitive position when there is an improvement in macroeconomic conditions

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following table sets forth certain information regarding the components of our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended february  as compared to the fiscal year ended february  it is provided to assist in assessing differences in our overall performance in thousands fiscal year ended february  of net sales february  of net sales change change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses  income loss from operations   interest  net and other   income before income taxes   income tax provision benefit   net income loss    effective income tax rate net sales net sales consist of retail and direct sales  which include co branded credit card program marketing fee and sales royalty revenue and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise 
net sales increased during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to the addition of premium retail stores and merchandise clearance outlet stores since february  this increase in net sales was offset by a decrease in comparable premium store sales during fiscal as compared with fiscal we also experienced an overall decrease in net sales in our direct segment as net sales from our phone and mail channel decreased while being partially offset by a slight increase in net sales from our internet channel 
comparable premium retail store sales growth by quarter are as follows percentage increase decrease premium retail store base fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter we define comparable premium stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months provided that store has been considered comparable for the entire quarter without closure for seven consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting sixteen months rather than twelve months to consider a store comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation 
we believe our sales performance for fiscal was negatively impacted by a highly promotional retail environment accompanied by difficult macroeconomic conditions and an over assortment of merchandise that did not differentiate us from our competitors 
in fiscal  we experienced a decline in premium retail store traffic of and a decrease in average transaction value of premium retail stores of as compared to fiscal the decrease in average transaction value in was primarily due to higher levels of markdowns and discounts due to increased promotional and clearance activity  including the discounts associated with our national magazine advertisements 
during fiscal we increased our national magazine advertising circulation by percent compared to fiscal catalog circulation also increased by million or percent during the same period  from million catalogs to million catalogs 
the increase in circulation was primarily due to additional coldwater creek and clearance catalog mailings 
we also added approximately  net new names to our e mail database since february  along with more targeted e mail campaigns  which resulted in an additional percent or million emails being delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we also experienced a decrease in co branded credit card marketing fee revenue and royalty revenue of million and million  respectively 
cost of sales gross profit the gross profit rate decreased by percentage points primarily due to increased promotional and clearance activity  decreased leveraging of retail occupancy costs  and inventory write downs related to aged and slow moving inventory 
the decrease in gross profit rate was partially offset by higher initial merchandise markups associated with the direct sourcing initiative and higher purchase volumes related to the retail expansion 
our gross profit rate decreased percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of an increase in markdowns and discounts  including those discounts related to national magazine advertisements  partially offset by higher initial merchandise markups 
our gross profit rate was also negatively impacted by a million  or percentage point  inventory write down related to aged and slow moving inventory 
also  a decrease in the leveraging of our buying and distribution costs  shipping and handling costs  and retail occupancy costs reduced our gross profit rate by approximately   and percentage points  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased by percentage points in fiscal as compared with fiscal this increase was the result of a percentage point increase in employee expenses  a percentage point increase in overhead costs  and a percentage point increase in marketing expenses 
employee expenses and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased as the result of retail administrative and store employee salaries  wages  taxes and benefits as we continue to increase staffing to support our expanding retail store base 
employee expenses were also impacted by increased stock based compensation of million and increased net periodic pension cost on our supplemental executive retirement plan of million  primarily as a result of a net curtailment loss related to the retirement of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by increased catalog circulation and the testing of television advertising 
the reduced leveraging in sg a expenses is primarily due to the decrease in comparable store sales 
interest  net and other the decrease in interest  net and other for fiscal as compared with fiscal is primarily the result of lower interest income earned on a lower average cash balances and lower interest rates  and higher interest expense primarily related to additional capital leases 
provision for income taxes the benefit for income taxes for fiscal as compared to the provision in fiscal was the result of a pre tax loss  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
segment results we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based upon segment operating income  which is shown below along with segment net sales in thousands fiscal year ended february  of net sales february  of net sales change net sales retail   direct internet phone and mail   total direct   segment operating income retail direct   the following table reconciles segment operating income to income from operations in thousands fiscal year ended february  february  change segment operating income   corporate and other   income loss from operations   retail segment sales the million increase in retail segment net sales for fiscal as compared with fiscal is primarily the result of the addition of premium retail stores  four merchandise clearance outlet stores and three day spas since february   which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our comparable premium retail stores as disclosed in the table above under net sales 
also included in the retail segment net sales growth during fiscal as compared with fiscal was an additional million in net sales from merchandise clearance outlet stores combined with an additional million in net sales from our day spa concept 
these increases were offset by a reduction of million in co branded credit card program fee and royalty revenue 
in addition to the increase in our store base  we believe increased promotional and clearance activity  and increased circulation in both national magazine advertisements and catalogs also contributed to our retail segment net sales 
segment operating income retail segment operating income rate expressed as a percentage of retail segment sales for fiscal as compared with fiscal decreased by percentage points 
increased promotional and clearance activity  partially offset by higher initial merchandise margins associated with our direct sourcing initiative and higher purchase volumes related to the retail expansion  resulted in a percentage point decline in merchandise margins 
in addition  our retail segment operating income rate was negatively impacted by a million  or a percentage point  inventory write down related to aged or slow moving inventory 
retail segment operating income rate was also negatively impacted by a percentage point reduction in the leveraging of retail store occupancy costs  a percentage point increase in employee expense  a percentage point increase in marketing costs  primarily related to retail store promotions and a percentage point reduction in the leveraging of certain overhead costs  primarily shipping supplies 
the reduced leveraging of operating expenses is primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales 
costs related to the day spa concept  which are included in the above analysis  decreased our overall retail segment operating income rate by approximately percentage points in fiscal compared to approximately percentage points in fiscal direct segment sales the direct segment net sales decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was driven by a percent decrease in catalog business net sales  offset by a percent increase in internet business net sales 
internet business net sales grew during the period as a result of increased promotional and clearance activity  the addition of approximately  net new names to our e mail database since february   increased e mail circulation percent or million e mails to customers in fiscal than in fiscal along with more targeted e mail campaigns 
catalog business net sales experienced a percent decline during fiscal as compared to fiscal catalog net sales are derived from orders taken from customers over the phone or through the mail 
catalogs are used as a brand marketing vehicle to drive sales in all channels as we encourage customers to choose the channel they deem most convenient 
sales made through other channels that we believe were driven by the initial receipt of a catalog are not included in catalog net sales 
consequently  as customers choose to purchase merchandise through other channels  we expect catalog business net sales to continue to generally decrease as a percent of total net sales 
included in the direct segment net sales decrease was an additional million reduction in co branded credit card program fee and royalty revenue  offset by an increase in direct shipping revenue of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal segment operating income direct segment operating income rate expressed as a percentage of direct sales for fiscal decreased percentage points as compared with fiscal increased promotional and clearance activity  partially offset by higher initial merchandise markups associated with our direct sourcing resulted in a percentage point decline in merchandise margins

the direct segment operating income rate was also negatively impacted by reduced leveraging of marketing and overhead costs which resulted in a percentage point and percentage point decline in direct segment operating income rate  respectively 
reduced leveraging of employee expenses contributed to a decrease of percentage points 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily the result of a million increase in marketing expenses primarily as a result of the testing of television advertising in the first half of fiscal  a million increase in employee expenses  predominantly corporate salaries and benefits  a million increase in occupancy costs primarily as a result of increased depreciation  facilities maintenance and taxes  a million increase in corporate support costs  primarily professional service fees and shipping supplies

comparable premium retail store sales growth by quarter is as follows percentage increase premium retail store base fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter in addition to the opening of new premium retail stores and comparable stores sales growth  net sales for fiscal benefited from a percent increase in national magazine advertising circulation as compared with fiscal catalog circulation also increased by five percent during the same period due primarily to additional coldwater creek catalog mailings  which are designed to drive premium retail store sales

shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these increases in net sales were partially offset by markdowns and discounts offered to customers as we increased our promotional activity  including clearance activity in the fiscal fourth quarter  as well as by discounts associated with the co branded credit card program

national magazine advertisements also contributed to the sg a expense increase as circulation grew by percent as compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses improved percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal this improvement in sg a expenses was the result of a percentage point decrease in catalog expense  partially offset by a percentage point increase in marketing and advertising expenses and a percentage point increase in employee expenses

provision for income taxes the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of higher pre tax income 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the same periods is primarily the result of a release of interest accrued on positions taken in prior year returns in which the statute of limitations expired and a shift to qualified performance based executive compensation programs which are now fully deductible for tax purposes 
these decreases to our effective rate were partially offset by stock option expense recorded for incentive stock options  related to our adoption of sfas r  which is not deductible for tax purposes

segment operating income retail segment operating income rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by percentage points 
this decrease was driven primarily by a percentage point increase related to costs primarily overhead  product and service costs and other employee expenses associated with the day spa concept 
in addition  increased promotional activity  including fourth quarter clearance activity  partially offset by improvements in merchandise margins related to higher initial merchandise markups associated with our direct sourcing initiative and higher purchase volumes related to the retail expansion contributed percentage points to the decline in retail segment operating income rate

offsetting these decreases was a percentage point improvement in retail store occupancy costs predominantly related to leveraging these costs over increased comparable premium retail store sales 
direct segment sales the direct segment net sales increase of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by a percent increase in internet business net sales 
internet business net sales grew during the period as a result of an expanding database of e mail addresses and an increase in the frequency of e mails sent to customers 
increased promotional activity during the latter half of fiscal also contributed to the growth 
sales through our phone and mail channel remained relatively flat year over year  experiencing a decline of percent 
included in the direct segment net sales increase was an additional million in shipping revenue associated with increased direct segment net sales in fiscal as compared to the fiscal and an additional million in co branded credit card program fee and royalty revenue

seasonality as with many apparel retailers  our net sales  operating results  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the number and timing of premium retail store openings  the timing of catalog mailings and the number of catalogs mailed  the timing of e mail campaigns  customer response to merchandise offerings  including the impact of economic and weather related influences  the actions of competitors and similar factors  overall merchandise return rates  including the impact of actual or perceived service and quality issues  our ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and the costs of obsolete inventory disposition  market price fluctuations in critical materials and services  including paper  production  postage and telecommunications costs  the timing of merchandise receiving and shipping  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine s day  easter  mother s day  thanksgiving and christmas 
we alter the composition  magnitude and timing of merchandise offerings based upon an understanding of prevailing consumer demand  preferences and trends 
the timing of merchandise offerings may be further impacted by  among other factors  the performance of various third parties on which we are dependent 
additionally  the net sales we realize from a particular merchandise offering may impact more than one fiscal quarter and year and the amount and pattern of the sales realization may differ from that realized by a similar merchandise offering in a prior fiscal quarter or year 
the majority of net sales from a merchandise offering generally are realized within the first several weeks after its introduction with an expected significant decline in customer demand thereafter 
our business materially depends on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement the existing workforce 
additionally  as gift items and accessories are more prominently represented in the november and december holiday season merchandise offerings  we typically expect  absent offsetting factors  to realize higher consolidated gross margins and earnings in the second half of our fiscal year 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected sales or profits during the november and december holiday selling season  our financial condition  results of operations  including related gross margins and cash flows for the entire fiscal year will be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources in recent fiscal years  we financed ongoing operations and growth initiatives primarily from cash flow generated by operations  trade credit arrangements and the proceeds from our may public offering of common stock 
however  as we produce catalogs  open retail stores and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales realization  and as operating cash flows and working capital experience fluctuations  we may occasionally utilize our bank credit facility 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  providing for an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to million and allowing us to issue up to million in letters of credit 
the interest rate under the credit agreement is based upon either the london interbank offered rate plus a margin ranging from percent to percent depending upon our leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  or the lender s prime rate 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants  including requirements for specified minimum net worth and fixed charge ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement restricts our ability to  among other things  dispose of assets except in the ordinary course of business  participate in mergers or acquisitions in excess of million  incur other indebtedness in excess of million and make certain investments 
in addition  we are subject to unused commitment fees based on a varying percentage of the amount of the total facility that is not drawn down under the credit agreement on a quarterly basis 
the credit facility has a maturity date of january  operating activities generated million  million and million of positive cash flow during fiscals  and  respectively 
on a comparative year to year basis  the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from higher operating expenses and inventory purchases  including accelerated payments of million on inventory purchases to take advantage of early payment discounts  primarily related to our retail expansion 
we also experienced a decrease in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating cash flows also decreased as a result of a decrease of million in fees collected from our co branded credit card program and a decrease in cash collected on interest income of million 
this decrease was offset by increased revenues and lower taxes paid of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal on a comparative year to year basis  the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from increased revenues  fees collected from our co branded credit card program of million and an increase in interest income collected of million 
we also experienced an increase in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was offset by higher operating expenses and inventory purchases primarily related to our retail expansion  in addition to an increase in income taxes paid of million 
also offsetting the increase in cash flows from operating activities was approximately million in tax deduction benefits related to stock option exercises that were recorded in cash flows from financing activities in fiscal  that would have been recorded in cash flows from operating activities if we had not adopted sfas r in fiscal the amount of tax deduction benefits recorded as an operating cash inflow in fiscal were approximately million 
cash outflows from investing activities principally consisted of capital expenditures which totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  three day spas  four merchandise clearance outlet stores and premium retail stores under construction  and to a lesser extent the remodeling of certain existing stores  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  and to a lesser extent our opening of three new outlet stores  the remodeling of certain existing stores  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores and three outlet stores and the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
cash outflows from financing activities were million during fiscal compared with cash inflows from financing activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash outflows related to the purchase and retirement of our common stock of million were partially offset by cash inflows of million related to stock option exercises  purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options 
the cash inflows in fiscal and fiscal were derived from activity related to stock option exercises  including tax deduction benefits that beginning in fiscal are recorded as a financing activity as a result of our adoption of sfas r 
as a result of the foregoing  we had million in working capital at february   compared with million at february  our current ratio was at february   compared with at february  we had no outstanding borrowing under our credit facility at february  or february  capital expenditures for the full year in fiscal are expected to be approximately million  primarily associated with the premium retail store expansion  store related expenditures  and office space expansion and  to a lesser extent  investments in information technology  the testing of our day spa concept and other corporate related capital expenditures 
we believe that cash on hand and working capital  along with cash flow from operations and  if necessary  available borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to fund current operations and retail store openings under our current store rollout plan 
future outlook during fiscal we operated in a highly promotional retail selling environment accompanied by lower customer traffic and challenging macroeconomic conditions 
these conditions which have continued into the first quarter of fiscal  have had a negative impact on our sales  gross margins and earnings 
we believe the current conditions will continue during the remainder of fiscal we expect our retail expansion to continue to be the key driver of future growth 
as we execute on our fiscal initiatives that we have previously discussed we will continue to incur additional costs to support our retail expansion and improve existing information technology infrastructure while at the same time focusing on controlling costs 
we believe that an effective implementation of these initiatives will put us in a strong competitive position when there is an improvement in macroeconomic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and costs of sales and establish and maintain a corresponding accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the ability to reasonably estimate sales returns is made more complex by the fact that we offer our customers a return policy whereby they may return merchandise for any reason and at any time without any restrictions as to condition or time of purchase to any of our locations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or web site  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the sales return accrual and cost of sales accordingly 
historically the difference between estimated sales returns and actual results has not been significant 
provisions for sales returns were as follows in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to net income deductions for actual returns current year adjustments to prior year reserve balance at end of period fiscal year ended january      february      february      customer loyalty programs we currently maintain a co branded credit card program 
under this program  we receive from the issuing bank an upfront non refundable marketing fee for each new account that is opened and activated 
we have determined  given our continuing involvement  that the initial upfront marketing fee should be deferred and recognized into revenue over the estimated life of the related customer relationship 
our estimate of the life of the customer relationship is based on the historical buying patterns of our customers and is subject to change based on actual buying patterns 
any increase in the estimated customer relationship period would result in less revenue being recognized in a reporting period  while any decrease in the customer relationship period would result in more revenue being recognized in a reporting period 
the change in our weighted average customer relationship period was not material for fiscal  and we also earn a sales royalty related to the co branded credit card program based on a percentage of purchases made by the holder of the credit card while the holder of the card earn points towards coupons which can be redeemed towards a future purchase of merchandise 
the sales royalty that we earn is initially deferred and subsequently recognized into income as coupons are redeemed by the customer 
in fiscal we introduced our onecreek customer loyalty program which entitles enrolled customers who maintain an annual level of spending to earn awards in the form of future discounts that can be redeemed towards a future purchase of merchandise 
we allocate the consideration received from the customer between the goods purchased and the award earned based on their relative fair values 
the consideration allocated to the award is recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue over the redemption period 
for both the royalty coupon awards and onecreek awards which we recognize revenue over the estimated redemption period which is generally through the expiration date of the award we estimate that a portion of the consideration that was originally deferred will not be redeemed by customers and we therefore recognize the portion that we expect never to be redeemed into income over the estimated redemption period breakage 
we determine our breakage rate based upon company specific historical redemption patterns 
if the actual redemption patterns were higher than our estimate  we would need to decrease our breakage factor which would result in a decrease in the amount of revenue recognized in the period of change 
if the actual redemption patterns were lower than our estimate  we would need to increase our breakage factor which would result in an increase in the amount of revenue recognized in the period of change 
inventory valuation our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are reflected  in the aggregate  on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising and marketing decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make subjective assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
during fiscal we experienced declining merchandise margins due to an increase in the amount of inventory being sold with markdowns and discounts 
we also experienced lower customer traffic than originally anticipated which resulted in an increase in slow moving and aged inventory 
these factors resulted in inventory write downs of approximately during fiscal  of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal though we currently believe our inventory write down is adequate based upon current forecasts which consider current and future selling prices  actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 
direct response advertising direct response advertising includes catalogs and national magazine advertisements that contain an identifying code that allows us to track the related sales 
all direct costs associated with the development  production and circulation of direct response advertising are accumulated as prepaid marketing costs until such time as the related catalog is mailed or the related national magazine advertisement first appears in print 
after that  these costs are reclassified as deferred marketing costs and are amortized into selling  general and administrative expenses over the expected sales realization cycle  typically several weeks 
our initial estimation of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular direct response advertisement is based upon  among other possible considerations  our historical sales and sell through experience with identical or similar direct response advertisements  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually track our subsequent sales realization  compile customer feedback for indications of future performance  reassess the marketplace  compare the findings to our previous estimate and adjust amortization going forward 
stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based upon the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeitures 
to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the immediate future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based upon the exercise and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
if expected volatility or expected life were to increase  that would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options which would result in higher compensation charges  while a decrease in volatility or the expected life would result in a lower fair value of our stock option awards resulting in lower compensation charges 
we also grant rsus and common stock which are less subjective in determining fair value as the fair value of these awards is based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and not on an option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our awards based upon historical experience of stock based pre vesting forfeitures 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures are higher than our estimates it would result in lower compensation expense and to the extent the actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate we would record higher compensation expense 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  more specifically leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures at our retail stores and day spas  are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  it is considered to be impaired and would be written down to its fair value 
except for the impairment loss of that we recorded in fiscal related to certain retail stores  we have not experienced any events that would indicate a potential impairment of the assets relating to our retail stores and day spas  but if circumstances change we could be required to record a loss for the impairment of long lived assets 
for example  given the infancy of the day spa concept and based upon management s current expectations we do not believe an impairment of the related assets exists 
if management s current expectations change  we could be required to record an impairment loss on assets related to the day spa concept 
supplemental executive retirement plan we maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan serp for certain executive officers which is an unfunded  non qualified benefit plan that will provide eligible participants with monthly benefits upon retirement  termination of employment  death or disability  subject to certain conditions 
we account for our serp using an actuarial model as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
we are required to make certain assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation such as a discount rate and rate of compensation increases for the participants 
in addition  upon adoption we recorded prior service cost for the past service of eligible plan participants which is deferred and recognized as expense over the average estimated remaining service period of all the participants 
given the small number of participants in the plan  if a plan participant was to retire prior to their estimated retirement date it would result in an acceleration of the expense of the prior service costs curtailment loss 
the amount of the curtailment loss could be reduced by any reduction in the related benefit obligation for any portion of the benefits that the retired participant had not vested 
for example  during fiscal we recorded a curtailment loss of approximately million as the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  who were both plan participants  retired prior to their estimated retirement date 
currently  ms 
shonk simmons and mr 
griesemer are the only employees accruing benefits under our serp

off balance sheet liabilities and other contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of february  in thousands payments due in fiscal year total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases a     contractual commitments b   capital leases c     other financing obligations d    other long term liabilities e f    total      a 
we lease retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
retail store leases require the payment of additional rent based on sales above a specified minimum 
the operating lease obligations noted above do not include any contingent rental expense we may incur based on future sales above the specified minimums 
several lease agreements provide lease renewal options 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options were exercised 
b 
contractual commitments include inventory purchase orders of million and construction commitments of million 
we expect to pay all of these commitments in the next twelve months 
the actual timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory and the terms of payment with the vendor 
c 
the weighted average interest rate on the capital leases is approximately percent 
based upon the payment terms of the lease agreements  the lease payments primarily represent interest only payments for the next twelve months 
payments represent the principal amounts due of million  accrued interest of  and interest expense to be incurred of approximately million 
d 
payments on other financing obligations represent interest expense to be incurred of approximately million and principal amounts due in fiscal of approximately million which has been recorded as a current liability and million of principal due in fiscal years and  which is recorded as a long term liability 
e 
other long term liabilities primarily include amounts on our february  consolidated balance sheet representing obligations under our supplemental executive retirement plan of million  million related to our employee retention compensation program  and asset retirement obligations under certain of our lease arrangements of million 
we expect payments of approximately million during the next twelve months related to the supplemental executive retirement plan 
the payments above relating to the million retention program  of which million will be paid during the next twelve months  do not include million of additional compensation that is to be recognized over the employees remaining service periods 
f 
we have excluded million and million of deferred rents and deferred revenue  respectively  from the other long term liabilities in the above table 
these amounts have been excluded as deferred rents relate to operating leases which are already reflected in the operating lease category above and the deferred revenue does not represent a contractual obligation that will be settled in cash 
our only individually significant operating lease is for our distribution center and customer contact center located in mineral wells  west virginia 
during the third quarter of fiscal  construction was completed on the  square foot expansion to this distribution center  increasing the distribution center size from  square feet to  square feet 
as a result  the distribution center operating lease was amended to include the expansion and extend the lease term from approximately years to years 
our remaining lease commitment as of february  is approximately million and has been reflected in the schedule above 
all other operating leases primarily pertain to retail and outlet stores  day spas and to various equipment and technology 
subsequent to february   we entered into additional retail leases with minimum lease payment requirements  and as a result  as of march  our operating lease commitments increased by million 
as of february  we had million in letters of credit issued 
related party transactions ann pence  who was the vice chairman of our board of directors until her retirement in august  is a holder of more than five percent of our common stock 
in connection with her retirement  and in recognition of her contributions as co founder of the company  she was given the honorary title of chairman emeritus  and was extended certain post retirement benefits 
during the fiscal third quarter  we accrued the net present value of the expected future benefit costs 
this accrual is being amortized ratably into consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses and offsets the impact of the current cost of providing post retirement benefits 
these amounts were immaterial to all periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
we have only been immaterially impacted by fluctuations in interest rates as a result of our relatively modest bank borrowings in recent fiscal years 
during the twelve month period ended february   we did not have borrowings under our credit facility and  consequently  did not have any material exposure to interest rate market risks during or at the end of this period 
however  as any future borrowings under our amended and restated bank credit facility will be at a variable rate of interest  we could potentially be materially adversely impacted should we require significant borrowings in the future  particularly during a period of rising interest rates 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments
