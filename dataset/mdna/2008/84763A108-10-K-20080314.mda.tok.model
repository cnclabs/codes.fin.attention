table of contents part i item business overview on march   we received approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  of our new drug application  or nda  for our drug product  levoleucovorin formerly  iso vorin tm 
we anticipate launching levoleucovorin in the us market in mid also  during the fourth quarter of  we will launch sumatriptan injection  the generic form of glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  through our commercialization partner  par pharmaceutical companies  inc we are a biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes a diversified portfolio of drug products  with a focus on oncology  urology and other critical health challenges 
we are focused on executing our business strategy  which is comprised of the following four parts acquiring and developing a broad and diverse pipeline of late stage clinical and commercial products with a focus on oncology and urology 
we acquire and develop multiple novel  late stage oncology drug products that address niche markets 
a late stage focus helps us effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many costly hurdles in the pre clinical and early clinical process 
our strategy allows us to leverage organizational  collaborative  commercial and scientific efficiencies from a therapeutic focus on oncology and urology 
establishing a commercial organization for levoleucovorin that will be available if and when each of the other drug products in our pipeline are approved 
as we transform from a development to a commercial organization  we are building a foundation for successful product launches 
continuing to build a team with significant drug development and commercialization expertise in our areas of focus and creating a culture of success that allows our people to thrive 
we have built the foundation of a team with significant experience in oncology and urology drug development 
we endeavor to leverage the talents of our team and add people who have relevant experience 
our team members have  in the past  been responsible for the development of drugs such as adriamycin  cisplatin  carboplatin  paclitaxel  etoposide  buspar  cialis  nefazodone and stadol  among others 
we also have  and will continue to bring  commercialization experience to the company as we build our commercial infrastructure 
leveraging the expertise of partners around the world in areas of manufacturing  development and commercialization to assist us in the execution of our strategy 
recent developments in  we continued to execute on our business strategy  which is described above 
below are some key developments 
for levoleucovorin  we filed an amendment to the nda with the fda to answer questions surrounding the chemistry manufacturing and control section of the nda 
we recently received approval from the fda for this drug 
for eoquin  we received concurrence from the fda for the design of a phase study protocol for the treatment of non invasive bladder cancer under a special protocol assessment procedure 
the development plan for eoquin calls for two phase clinical studies 
the first study began during the second quarter of  and the second study began during the third quarter of we recently received scientific advice from the european medicines agency  or emea  the european equivalent to the fda  whereby the emea agreed that the two phase studies being conducted at this time  mostly in the united states  should be sufficient for a regulatory decision regarding european registration 
we continue to enroll patients in these two studies and plan to add study sites in 
table of contents canada to accelerate patient enrollment since we recently received authorization from the canadian health authorities allowing us to initiate the trials in canada 
for ozarelix  the fda accepted our investigational new drug  or ind  application to study ozarelix for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy  or bph as it is commonly known  and also approved the protocol for a phase b study of ozarelix for the treatment of bph 
we completed patient enrollment in such study and expect that complete data will be available by mid april while we wait for the data  we are concurrently working on the design of the protocol for the next study  which we expect to initiate soon thereafter 
for satraplatin  in we received approximately million in revenues from gpc biotech ag  our sublicensee for the drug  and we paid johnson matthey  our licensor of the drug  an aggregate of million in milestone payments  in connection with the achievement of certain regulatory milestones by gpc 
on october   gpc announced that the phase trial evaluating satraplatin for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint 
while the disappointment with satraplatin represents the elimination of one future source of non dilutive funding for our drug development plans  it should be noted that a marketing authorization application for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer is still under review in europe 
also  gpc has stated that it has revised its development plans for satraplatin and has decided to continue certain clinical trials  stop other studies and selectively initiate new trials 
we entered into a worldwide license agreement for ortataxel  a third generation taxane that has demonstrated oral bioavailability and clinical activity against taxane refractory tumors 
we acquired these rights from indena spa  the italian company that discovered ortataxel 
ortataxel belongs to a new generation of taxanes with the potential to be active against tumors resistant to bristol myers squibb s taxol paclitaxel and sanofi aventis taxotere docetaxel 
while we are optimizing the oral formulation for better bioavailability  we may consider some studies with the parenteral formulation 
we recently initiated an open label  dose escalation phase study assessing the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of spi in patients with recurrent or progressive carcinoma 
in may  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share without issuing any warrants 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  after placement agent fees and estimated expenses  were approximately million  providing us with additional capital resources to advance the development of our drug products 
product portfolio new drug development  which is the process whereby drug product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing a nda or similar filing in other countries and eventually obtaining marketing approval from the fda or a marketing authorization from other regulatory authorities outside of the united states  is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process that requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulatory authorities that the products are both safe and effective for their respective indications 

table of contents our drug products  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table  and discussed below in further detail pipeline graph while other indications have not yet been identified  some of our drug products may prove to be beneficial in additional disease indications as we continue to study and develop these drug products 
in addition  we have intellectual property rights to neurology compounds that we may out license to third parties for further development 
we believe our drug products have the potential to be effective therapeutic agents with some advantages over existing therapies 
our goal is to develop and commercialize many of these drug products in the united states and license the rights for outside the united states to global partners to the extent that we have rights outside the united states 
overview of major indications we are targeting cancer cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states  accounting for approximately of all deaths 
in its most recent annual report  the american cancer society reported that in the under age group  cancer is the leading cause of death 
in the united states  approximately million new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in and over  persons were expected to die from the disease in accordingly  there is significant demand for improved and novel cancer treatments 
cancer develops when cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control 
although there are many kinds of cancer  they all start because of out of control growth of abnormal cells 
normal body cells grow  divide  and die in an orderly fashion 
during the early years of a person s life  normal cells divide more rapidly until the person 
table of contents becomes an adult 
after that  cells in most parts of the body divide only to replace worn out or dying cells and to repair injuries 
because cancer cells continue to grow and divide  they are different from normal cells 
instead of dying  they outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cells 
cancer cells develop because of damage to dna 
most of the time  when dna becomes damaged  the body is able to repair it 
in cancer cells  the damaged dna is not repaired 
people can inherit damaged dna  which accounts for inherited cancers 
more often  however  a person s dna becomes damaged by exposure to something in the environment  like smoking 
cancer usually forms as a tumor 
some cancers  like leukemia  do not form tumors 
instead  these cancer cells involve the blood and blood forming organs and circulate through other tissues where they grow 
often  cancer cells travel to other parts of the body where they begin to grow and replace normal tissue 
this process is called metastasis 
regardless of where a cancer may spread  however  it is always named for the place it began 
for instance  breast cancer that spreads to the liver is still called breast cancer  not liver cancer 
different types of cancer can behave very differently 
for example  lung cancer and breast cancer are very different diseases 
they grow at different rates and respond to different treatments 
that is why people with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their particular kind of cancer 
cancer is currently treated by surgery  chemotherapy  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy and immunotherapy 
cancer is referred to as refractory when it has not responded  or is no longer responding  to a treatment 
we are seeking novel drugs  drug delivery methods and combination therapies that address cancer or cancer related indications with significant unmet medical need  that have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in clinical trials and or we believe have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development  target cancer indications with significant unmet medical need  where current treatments either do not exist or are not effective  and we believe we can acquire at a fair value based on our judgment of clinical success and commercial potential 
benign prostatic hypertrophy the prostate is a walnut sized gland that forms part of the male reproductive system 
the prostate is located in front of the rectum and just below the bladder  where urine is stored 
the prostate also surrounds the urethra  the canal through which urine passes out of the body 
bph is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate leading to difficulty in passing urine  reduced flow of urine  discomfort or pain while passing urine and increased frequency of urination 
according to the national kidney and urologic diseases information clearinghouse  bph rarely causes symptoms before age  but more than half of men in their sixties and as many as percent in their seventies and eighties have some symptoms of bph 
as life expectancy rises  so does the occurrence of bph 
treatment options for benign prostatic hypertrophy include surgery and medications to reduce the amount of tissue and increase the flow of urine 
our drug products levoleucovorin for injection formerly  iso vorin tm on march   our nda for our proprietary drug levoleucovorin was approved by the fda 
levoleucovorin is a novel folate analog formulation and the pharmacologically active isomer the levo isomer of the racemic compound  calcium leucovorin 
isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula  but mirror image atomic structures 
leucovorin is a mixture of equal parts of both isomers the pharmacologically active levo isomer and the inactive dextro isomer 
preclinical studies have demonstrated that the inactive dextro isomer competes with the active levo isomer for uptake at the cellular level 
by removing the inactive dextro form  the dosage of levoleucovorin is one half that of leucovorin and patients are spared the administration of an inactive substance 
levoleucovorin is indicated after high dose methotrexate therapy in patients with osteosarcoma  and to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination or inadvertent overdose of folic acid antagonists 
levoleucovorin has been designated as an orphan drug for its approved indications 

table of contents methotrexate is a widely used anti cancer drug 
it is a therapeutic option in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies  such as non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in addition  methotrexate is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis and some rare opportunistic infections 
levoleucovorin has been marketed and sold under different trade names by wyeth  sanofi aventis  takeda and others in certain parts of the world  including europe and japan 
a tradename for levoleucovorin for injection is currently under review by the fda 
our next filing will be an nda amendment for levoleucovorin tablets which is expected by mid june following the tablet submission  we plan to file a supplemental nda of levoleucovorin in combination with fu containing regimens in the treatment of colorectal cancer 
calcium leucovorin is currently a standard combination agent with fu in various colorectal cancer treatment regimens 
there are peer reviewed publications wherein levoleucovorin is used in place of the leucovorin in combination with fu containing regimens for adjuvant and advanced colorectal cancer and in combination with oxaliplatin and or irinotecan for advanced disease 
levoleucovorin is currently listed as a replacement for calcium leucovorin in the national comprehensive cancer network clinical practice guidelines in oncology 
the nccn drugs and biologics compendium is an important reference that has been recognized by united healthcare as a formal guidance for coverage policy 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to levoleucovorin licensing and development 
in april  we acquired all of the oncology drug product assets of targent  inc pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  we have to date issued to targent  or its stockholders  an aggregate amount of  shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair market value of  also  due to the recent fda approval of the nda  we are obligated to issue to targent  or its stockholders  an aggregate amount of  shares of our common stock with a fair market value of  as of the date the milestone was achieved 
in addition  targent is eligible to receive additional payments  in the form of our common stock and or cash  upon achievement of certain additional regulatory and sales milestones 
at our option  any amounts due in cash under the purchase agreement may be paid by issuing shares of our common stock having a value  determined as provided in the purchase agreement  equal to the cash payment amount 
in may  we amended and restated a license agreement with merck eprova ag  a swiss corporation  or eprova  that we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the assets of targent 
pursuant to the license agreement  we obtained the exclusive license to use regulatory filings related to levoleucovorin and a non exclusive license under certain patents and know how related to levoleucovorin to develop  make  have made  use  sell and have sold levoleucovorin in the field of oncology in north america 
also  we have the right of first opportunity to negotiate an exclusive license to manufacture  have manufactured  use and sell levoleucovorin products outside the field of oncology in north america 
under the terms of the license agreement  we will pay eprova  for the achievement of fda approval of levoleucovorin for injection 
eprova is also eligible to receive a payment upon achievement of another regulatory milestone  in addition to royalties on potential net sales  if any 
the term of the license agreement is determined on a product by product and country by country basis until royalties are no longer owed under the license agreement 
the license agreement expires in its entirety after the date that we no longer owe any royalties to eprova 
we have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement  in its entirety or on a product by product or country by country basis  at any time for any reason and either party may terminate the license agreement due to material breach of the terms of the license agreement by or insolvency of the other party 
in may  we also entered into a manufacturing and supply with eprova  whereby eprova shall manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of levoleucovorin for us at a set price 
the manufacturing and supply agreement shall remain in force as long as we are obligated to pay royalty payments to eprova under certain sections of the license agreement

either party may terminate the manufacturing agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party 

table of contents sumatriptan injection during the fourth quarter of we will launch sumatriptan injection  the generic form of glaxosmithkline s  or gsk  imitrex injection  which is currently selling on the market and is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes 
we plan to market the product through par pharmaceutical companies  inc  or par  our partner for the sale and distribution of the drug 
pursuant to the terms of our agreement with par  we will receive a majority of the profits from the sale of sumatriptan injection 
in october  we filed an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with paragraph iv certification  with the fda  for sumatriptan injection 
in february  gsk commenced suit against us  alleging that the filing of our anda infringes their patent covering imitrex 
in december  the litigation was dismissed by the united states district court for the district of delaware pursuant to a settlement agreement between gsk and us 
the terms of the settlement agreement provide that we may distribute authorized generic versions of sumatriptan injection products in the united states with a launch in the fourth quarter of during gsk s sumatriptan pediatric exclusivity period 
concurrent with the execution of the settlement agreement  gsk entered into a supply and distribution agreement with par for certain of the sumatriptan injection products 
pursuant to the terms of such agreement  gsk shall supply par with the sumatriptan injection products at a price set forth in such agreement 
the agreement may be terminated by a either party based upon material breach of the terms of the agreement by the other party or insolvency of the other party  b mutual consent by gsk  par and us  or c par if gsk presents par with an increase in pricing for the products because the amount of the price paid by par to gsk for the products reaches a level that is at or below gsk s cost of goods 
in february  we entered into a development and marketing agreement with par  whereby we granted par the exclusive right to market our sumatriptan injection product in the united states 
we own the anda for sumatriptan injection and are responsible for maintaining the appropriate regulatory approvals 
at the time we entered in the agreement  par assumed all the expenses going forward of the litigation between us and gsk regarding sumatriptan injection 
in november  we amended the agreement  and pursuant to the amended terms  par paid us a million milestone payment related to sumatriptan injection 
as mentioned above  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we will receive a majority of the profits from the sale of sumatriptan injection 
the term of the agreement expires ten years after the commercial launch of sumatriptan injection 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated by a either party based upon material breach of the terms of the agreement by the other party  b mutual consent by both parties  or c par if par decides to market a competing product  as that term is defined in the agreement 
eoquin eoquin is an anti cancer agent that becomes activated by certain enzymes often present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal cells 
it is currently being developed for the treatment of non invasive bladder cancer  which is cancer that is only in the innermost layer of the bladder and has not spread to deeper layers of the bladder 
eoquin is the trademarked name for the drug substance apaziquone formulated for administration directly into the urinary bladder intravesical instillation 
the american cancer society estimates that the incidence and prevalence of bladder cancer in the united states will be approximately  and over  respectively 
based on globocan data  we estimate that the incidence and prevalence of bladder cancer in europe is approximately  and  respectively 
according to botteman et al  pharmacoeconomics  bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer to treat on a lifetime basis 
the initial treatment of this cancer is complete surgical removal of the tumor 
however  bladder cancer is a highly recurrent disease with approximately of patients recurring within years  and a majority of patients recurring within years 
this high recurrence rate is attributed to the highly implantable nature of cancer cells that are dispersed during surgery  incomplete tumor resection  and tumors present in multiple locations in the bladder which may be missed or too small to visualize at the time of resection 
despite evidence in the published literature and guidance from the american and european urology associations  instillation of a chemotherapeutic agent immediately following surgery is not a standard clinical practice 
currently  there are no approved drugs for this indication which may  in part  explain the difference between the literature and urology guidelines and actual clinical management of this disease 
for more than years no new drugs have been introduced in the market for 
table of contents treatment of non invasive bladder cancer 
an immediate instillation of eoquin may help by reducing tumor recurrence by destroying dispersed cancer cells that would otherwise re implant onto the inner lining of the bladder  by destroying remaining cancer cells at the site of tumor resection also known as chemo resection  and by destroying tumors not observed during resection 
eoquin is a bio reductive prodrug that is activated by enzymes that are over expressed by bladder tumors 
a pharmacokinetic study verified that eoquin is not absorbed through the bladder wall into the bloodstream at the current proposed dose when given immediately after surgical resection and thus carries a minimal risk of systemic toxicity 
additionally  the current proposed dose is a fraction of the systemic toxic dose 
these features of eoquin are distinct from the other intravesical agents in use for the treatment of recurrent bladder cancer 
a phase dose escalation marker lesion study demonstrated that eoquin had no systemic toxicity  and was well tolerated at the dose level being used in the phase trials 
eoquin also demonstrated anti tumor activity against non invasive bladder cancer  as evidenced by eight of twelve patients showing a complete response  defined as the complete disappearance of the tumor as confirmed by biopsy  after receiving six treatments with eoquin over a period of six weeks 
phase data has confirmed anti tumor activity in patients with multiple  recurrent non invasive bladder cancer  as evidenced by thirty one of forty six patients showing a complete response after receiving six weekly treatments with mg of eoquin instilled into the urinary bladder in this marker lesion study 
eoquin was well tolerated  with no significant systemic toxicity  and local toxicity limited to temporary chemical cystitis inflammation of the urinary bladder resulting in increased urinary frequency  dysuria painful urination and hematuria blood in the urine in a few patients 
in addition  there was no adverse effect on wound healing when administered immediately after surgery 
in september  we initiated an open label  multi center clinical study in europe in high risk bladder cancer in patients 
patients with high risk bladder cancer usually have more aggressive bladder cancer with higher incidence of recurrence and or progression to a more invasive stage  where the cancer invades the muscle wall of the bladder  which may require total surgical removal of the bladder 
enrollment is almost complete 
we plan to follow all patients for twenty four months or until recurrence or progressive disease is observed 
in  we performed a patient pilot safety study in low grade non invasive bladder cancer 
in this study  eoquin was found to be well tolerated when a single mg dose is given to patients immediately following surgery 
in addition  there was no adverse effect on wound healing and eoquin was not absorbed into the bloodstream from the bladder wall 
in march  we received concurrence from the fda for the design of a phase study protocol for the treatment of non invasive bladder cancer under a special protocol assessment procedure 
the development plan for eoquin calls for two randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trials  each with patients with tag g low grade non invasive bladder cancer 
patients will be randomized in a one to one ratio to eoquin or placebo 
the patients will be given a single mg dose following surgical removal of the tumors 
the primary endpoint will be a statistically significant difference p in the rate of tumor recurrence at year two between the eoquin patient group and the placebo group 
the first study began during the second quarter of  and the second study began during the third quarter of we recently received scientific advice from the emea whereby the emea agreed that the two phase studies as designed should be sufficient for a regulatory decision regarding european registration 
we continue to enroll patients in these two studies and plan to add study sites in canada to accelerate enrollment since we recently received authorization from the canadian health authorities allowing us to initiate one of the trials in canada 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to eoquin licensing and development 
in  we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to eoquin and numerous related derivates from inc research  formerly nddo research foundation  in the netherlands  in exchange for an up front fee of  additional payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
the term of the agreement expires when all patents that are the subject of the license in the agreement expire  although some obligations survive 
table of contents termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by us upon three months notice to inc research 
ozarelix ozarelix  a lhrh luteinizing hormone releasing hormone  also known as gnrh or gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist a substance that blocks the effects of a natural hormone found in the body is currently being investigated for its targeted indications in hormone dependent prostate cancer  or hdpc  bph and endometriosis 
mechanistically  lhrh antagonists exert rapid inhibition of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone with an accompanying rapid decrease in sex hormones and would therefore be expected to be effective in a variety of hormonally dependent disease states including ovarian cancer  prostate cancer  bph  infertility  uterine myoma and endometriosis 
testosterone is considered to play a role in bph 
unlike lhrh agonists  ozarelix  which is an antagonist of lhrh  has the potential to reduce testosterone thus to decrease the prostate size and improve symptoms without the severe side effects associated with complete reduction in testosterone to castration levels 
current therapies for bph either address its symptoms but not the underlying condition  or block growth of new prostate cells and reduce prostate size with only moderate relief of symptoms 
there are two classes of drugs currently approved to treat bph 
the first  alpha adrenergic receptor blockers  are believed to work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the urethra and bladder without addressing the underlying condition of the enlarged prostate 
drugs in the second category  alpha reductase inhibitors  work by blocking production of the hormones that stimulate the growth of new prostate cells thereby stopping and eventually reversing enlargement of the prostate 
this class of drugs has a slow onset of action  typically requiring daily treatment for many months before improving patient symptoms 
drugs in both classes need to be dosed daily and can have significant side effects  including decreased libido  impotence  abnormal ejaculation  rhinitis and cardiovascular effects such as dizziness  fainting and lightheadedness 
many patients ultimately fail existing medical therapy  leading to over  surgical procedures annually in the united states  despite the risks of serious surgical complications including impotence and incontinence 
we believe that ozarelix could provide rapid relief of the symptoms of bph 
phase data with ozarelix in patients with bph in a double blinded  randomized  placebo controlled  multi center  dose ranging study were positive 
statistically significant results were seen for the primary endpoint in favor of ozarelix 
clinical improvement was maintained for six months following initial dosing of ozarelix 
ozarelix was also found to be safe and well tolerated in the study 
based on the results of this dose finding study  ozarelix mg  given on day and day  was chosen to be developed for this indication 
in january  the fda accepted our ind application for ozarelix in bph and also approved the protocol for a phase b study of ozarelix for the treatment of bph 
the phase b study is a randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled trial of ozarelix involving approximately men suffering from bph 
in this trial  the men have been dosed by intramuscular injection with mg of ozarelix or placebo on day and day and are being followed for nine months 
the study is evaluating safety and assessing the clinical efficacy of ozarelix as a treatment for bph 
the primary endpoint of the study is the improvement of bph symptoms as measured by the international prostate symptom score  which is designed to assess the severity of bph 
the study is also measuring urine flow  residual urine volume and quality of life 
we completed patient enrollment and expect that complete data will be available by mid april 
while we wait for the data  we are concurrently working on the design of the protocol for the next study  which is expected to initiate soon thereafter 
the initial treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy 
we believe ozarelix may prove to be an important addition in treating hormone dependent prostate cancer patients because of its ability to induce prolonged testosterone suppression in healthy volunteers as shown in early trials 
phase data for ozarelix in hormone dependent prostate cancer appears to be positive 
patients receiving mg per cycle of ozarelix showed the greatest continuous testosterone suppression  the primary endpoint 
in patients with continuous testosterone suppression  tumor response  as measured by psa levels  was 
ozarelix was well tolerated at all doses 
we are currently working with our licensor for the drug  aeterna zentaris  to develop a longer acting  commercially feasible depo formulation 
endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is also found elsewhere in the body  but mainly in the abdominal cavity 
this painful condition typically affects women during their menstruating years 
table of contents and is rarely found after menopause 
currently  there is no cure for endometriosis 
however  symptoms associated with endometriosis can be managed through a combination of treatments 
we believe intermittent administration of ozarelix can be used to treat endometriosis both through transient estrogen suppression and a direct effect on the lhrh receptors present in the endometrial tissue 
we are considering a phase study to study ozarelix as a treatment for endometriosis 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to ozarelix licensing and development 
in  we entered into a license agreement with a subsidiary of aeterna zentaris inc  aeterna zentaris gmbh  whereby we acquired an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ozarelix in north america including canada and mexico and india 
in addition  we have a financial interest in any income aeterna zentaris derives from ozarelix in japan 
in  we paid an up front fee of approximately million and issued  shares of our common stock valued at  and in  we paid a development milestone payment of approximately million 
we are also contingently obligated to pay additional amounts based upon achievement of milestones and a royalty based on any future net sales 
also  during  aeterna zentaris entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with nippon kayaku co 
ltd 
of japan for the development and marketing of ozarelix for all potential oncological indications in japan  and received an up front payment and is eligible to receive payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  in addition to low double digit royalties on potential net sales 
under the terms of our license agreement with aeterna zentaris  we are entitled to receive fifty percent of the up front and milestone payments and royalties received from nippon kayaku co 
ltd 
by aeterna zentaris 
in this regard  we received a payment of  in in the event aeterna zentaris  or another licensee  independently develops ozarelix for territories not licensed to us  we are entitled to receive and utilize the results of those development efforts 
similarly  aeterna zentaris is entitled to receive and utilize the results of our development efforts in north america and india 
with certain exceptions  we are required to purchase all finished drug product from aeterna zentaris for the clinical development of ozarelix at a set price 
the parties agreed to discuss entering into a joint supply agreement for commercial supplies of finished drug product 
the term of the license agreement expires ten years after the first commercial sale of a product in any country within the territory or as long as any product is covered by a patent in any country in the territory  whichever term is longer  although some obligations survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in some cases either in whole or on a product by product and or country by country and or indication by indication basis  based upon material breach or the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other  or by us upon sixty days notice to aeterna zentaris 
ortataxel in july  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement for ortataxel  a third generation taxane 
we acquired these rights from indena spa  a natural products company 
ortataxel has been shown to be bioavailable when administered orally to patients with solid tumors 
in addition  it belongs to a new generation of taxanes with the potential to be active against tumors resistant to paclitaxel bristol myers squibb s taxol and docetaxel sanofi aventis taxotere 
phase and studies in more than patients with solid tumors have shown responses in patients that were refractory to treatment with the available taxane drugs 
the safety profile of ortataxel is comparable to that of paclitaxel and docetaxel 
while we are optimizing the oral formulation for better bioavailiablity  we are considering some studies with the parenteral formulation 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to ortataxel licensing and development 
under the terms of the license agreement with indena  we gained exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to ortataxel 
we made an up front payment to indena of approximately million  and will also make additional payments based on the achievement of certain development  regulatory filing and sales milestones 
we will also pay indena single digit royalties on worldwide sales of ortataxel  if and when the product is approved 
the license agreement expires on a product by product and country by country basis upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties applicable to such product in such country 
the license agreement shall expire in its entirety after the date on which we no longer owe any royalties to indena 
in addition  the license agreement may be terminated earlier unilaterally by us at any 
table of contents time and for any reason  and by either party upon material breach of the terms of the license agreement by or insolvency of the other party 
also  we shall purchase all of our requirements of ortataxel active pharmaceutical ingredient from indena pursuant to terms to be agreed to in a separate agreement 
spi spi is a highly selective peptide agonist of endothelin b receptors  which can stimulate receptors on endothelial cells  the innermost layer of cells lining the blood vessels 
this technology takes advantage of the fact that the blood supply to tumors is different than the blood supply to healthy organs 
blood vessels in the growing part of tumors are relatively devoid of smooth muscle covering and are rich in endothelial cells 
therefore  by stimulating the endothelial b receptors present on the endothelial cells  spi should selectively increase tumor blood flow while sparing healthy tissue 
chemotherapy is one of the mainstays of therapy for solid carcinomas  including breast  lung  and prostate 
chemotherapy uses drugs called cytotoxic agents that are poisonous to cells and kill cancer cells 
chemotherapy often fails because adequate and uniform distribution of the cytotoxic agents is not achieved in the tumor  and serious side effects can result from toxicity to normal cells 
consequently  any means to increase the delivery of a cytotoxic agent selectively to tumors  while minimizing its concentration in normal tissues may be beneficial 
spi is being developed as an adjunct to chemotherapy 
in pre clinical studies  when anti cancer drugs  such as paclitaxel  are administered shortly after spi  the anti cancer drug concentration in the tumor is increased several fold 
this results in increased anti tumor efficacy at a given dose of a cytotoxic agent  and might allow physicians to maximize efficacy with reduced cytotoxic agent doses with resultant decreased toxicity to the normal organs 
we recently initiated an open label  dose escalation phase study assessing the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of spi in patients with recurrent or progressive carcinoma 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to spi licensing and development 
in february  we entered into a license agreement with chicago labs  inc  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize spi for the prevention and treatment of cancer 
we paid chicago labs an up front fee of  and we are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  after marketing approval is obtained from the fda and other regulatory authorities 
the term of the license agreement shall endure on a product by product and country by country basis until the expiration of the obligation by us to pay royalties applicable to such product in such country 
the license agreement shall expire in its entirety after the date that we no longer owe any royalties to chicago labs 
chicago labs may terminate the license agreement if we do not meet certain development deadlines that may be extended by chicago labs upon our request if we demonstrate good faith efforts to meet the deadlines 
we have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement  in its entirety or on a product by product or country by country basis  at any time for any reason 
in addition  either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement or becomes insolvent 
elsamitrucin elsamitrucin is an anti tumor antibiotic that acts as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes involved in dna replication  topoisomerase i and ii 
by inhibiting the activity of these two key enzymes involved in dna replication  elsamitrucin is thought to lead to dna breaks that prevent the correct replication of dna and ultimately result in cancer cell death 
on the basis of previous studies conducted by our licensor  bristol myers squibb  or bms  elsamitrucin has been shown to have minimal toxicity to bone marrow while demonstrating promising anti tumor activity 
we conducted a phase  single agent study in heavily pre treated patients with non hodgkins lymphoma 
the level of activity seen did not justify further development for this indication as a single agent 
however  since elsamitrucin appears to have synergy with taxane and platinum derivatives in experimental models  a phase i dose escalation study of elsamitrucin in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors is being planned 
minimal toxicity to bone marrow may allow combinations with other drugs without a need to significantly 
table of contents reduce doses  which may result in improved therapeutic effects 
after the phase study is completed we will consider initiating phase studies with this combination in selected solid tumors 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to elsamitrucin licensing and development 
we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to elsamitrucin from its developer  bms  in  in exchange for an up front fee of  additional payments based upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
the term of the agreement shall terminate as to each product in each country upon the expiration of the royalty term the period of time commencing on the effective date of the agreement and ending on the date that is the latest of i ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of such product in such country  or ii the expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims in a patent necessary for the manufacture  use and sale of such product in such country 
the agreement shall terminate in its entirety upon its termination in all countries 
we have the right to terminate the agreement in its entirety at any time by giving written notice to bms 
either party may terminate the agreement upon material breach of the terms of the agreement by the other party 
the agreement shall terminate automatically in the event that we fail to maintain all insurance coverage that we are required to maintain under the agreement 
lucanthone lucanthone is an orally administered small molecule which inhibits topoisomerase ii and ap endonuclease 
in preclinical tests  lucanthone was shown to enhance the sensitivity of animals to an anticancer agent in a time dependent and reversible manner 
lucanthone was originally used as an antiparasitic agent for the treatment of schistosomiasis in the s and s  and has a demonstrated safety profile 
it was later discontinued because better anti parasitic medications became available 
a phase i dose escalation study of lucanthone in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas receiving temozolomide is being planned 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to lucanthone licensing and development 
in may  we entered into a license agreement with dr 
robert e 
bases  the inventor of a method of treating cancer of the central nervous system through the administration of lucanthone and radiation  whereby we acquired worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize a product based upon his invention 
under the terms of the license agreement  we made an up front payment of  to dr 
bases and we are obligated to make additional periodic payments  a payment upon achievement of a certain regulatory milestone and royalties on potential net sales  if any 
the term of the license agreement shall endure on a product by product and country by country basis until the expiration of the obligation by us to pay royalties applicable to such product in such country 
the license agreement shall expire in its entirety after the date that we no longer owe any royalties to dr 
bases 
we have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement  in its entirety or on a product by product or country by country basis  at any time for any reason 
in addition  either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the liense agreement or becomes insolvent 
renazorb renazorb  a second generation lanthanum based nanoparticle phosphate binding agent  has the potential to address hyperphosphatemia  high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with stage chronic kidney disease end stage renal disease 
hyperphosphatemia affects patients with chronic kidney disease  especially end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis 
it can lead to significant bone disease including pain and fractures and cardiovascular disease  and is independently associated with increased mortality 
according to the national kidney foundation  in there will be an estimated  patients with end stage renal disease in the united states 
during the past decade  the end stage renal disease population is estimated to have grown by approximately annually 
treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering blood phosphate levels by restricting dietary phosphorus intake  and using  on a daily basis  and with each meal  oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate before its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream 
restricting dietary phosphorus intake has historically not been a successful means of serum phosphate control  therefore phosphate binders are the mainstay of hyperphosphatemia management 

table of contents currently marketed therapies for treating hyperphosphatemia include polymer based and lanthanum based phosphate binders  aluminum based phosphate binders  and calcium based phosphate binders 
under the national kidney foundation k doqi guidelines  both calcium based phosphate binders and non calcium  non aluminum  non magnesium phosphate binders are recommended as first line or long term therapy for the management of hyperphosphatemia 
however  the current therapies require use of a large number of pills or large pills to be chewed or swallowed along with each meal  leading to problems with patient compliance with the treatment regimen 
we believe that renazorb has the opportunity  because of its potentially higher capacity for binding phosphate on an equal weight basis  to significantly improve patient compliance by offering the lowest in class dosage to achieve the same therapeutic benefit as other phosphate binders 
we continue to perform preclinical development work on renazorb 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to renazorb licensing and development 
on january   we entered into a license agreement with altair nanomaterials  inc and its parent altair nanotechnologies  inc  or altair  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide right to develop and commercialize renazorb for all human therapeutic and diagnostic uses 
under the terms of the license agreement  we issued to altair  shares of our common stock valued at  as an upfront payment and made an equity investment of  in  shares of altair s common stock 
in  we also issued altair  shares of our common stock valued at  in connection with this payment of a milestone and for transfer of technology related to formulation improvements to renazorb developed by altair 
in addition  altair is eligible to receive payments upon achievement of a clinical development and certain regulatory and sales milestones  in addition to royalties on potential net sales 
the term of the license agreement shall expire on a product by product and country by country basis upon the later to occur of a expiration or final rejection without right of appeal of the last to expire patent that covers such product in such country  or b the entry of generic competition in such country 
we have the unilateral right to terminate the license agreement  in its entirety or on a product by product or country by country basis  at any time for any reason 
in addition  either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the license agreement or becomes insolvent 
spi spi  a lipid suspension of leteprinim  has demonstrated  in experimental models  benefits in treating chemotherapy induced pheripheral neuropathy 
chemotherapy drugs can damage the nervous system  especially the pheripheral nervous system which are those nerves that carry motor movement information for muscle contraction and those that carry sensory information such as touch  vibration  pain and temperature 
damage to the pheripheral nerves is known as neuropathy 
currently  there is no effective treatment for chemotherapy induced neuropathy 
during  we plan to continue preclinical evaluation of spi satraplatin satraplatin  an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapy agent  is being developed by our sublicensee  gpc biotech ag 
on october   gpc announced that the phase trial evaluating satraplatin for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint and  as a result  gpc did not refile the nda with the fda seeking approval for satraplatin 
however  a marketing authorization application for the same indication is still under review in europe 
gpc has stated that it has revised its development plans for satraplatin and has decided to continue certain trials  stop other studies and selectively initiate new trials 
the following describes the commercial terms relating to satraplatin licensing and development 
in  we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to satraplatin from its developer  johnson matthey  plc  or johnson matthey  in exchange for an up front fee  additional payments to be made based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties based on any net sales  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
the term of the license agreement expires on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire patents granted in each country  although some obligations  such as provisions relating to confidentiality  survive termination 
in addition  the license agreement may be terminated earlier by johnson matthey if we fail to make any milestone or royalty payments on the date due  by us at any time upon sixty days notice  or by either party upon breach of the terms of the license agreement 
table of contents by or commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other party 
we paid to johnson matthey  upon achievement by gpc of certain regulatory milestones in each of our contingent future cash payment milestone obligations to johnson matthey is generally matched by a corresponding  greater milestone receivable from gpc see below 
in  in exchange for an up front license fee and future milestones and royalties  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc for worldwide rights for further development and commercialization of satraplatin 
under the terms of this agreement  gpc agreed to fully fund the development expenses for satraplatin 
in december  gpc licensed commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand to pharmion corporation 
to date  we have received  in up front and milestone payments and approximately  in commissions on the sale of satraplatin product to gpc 
in addition  during  pursuant to the license agreement  gpc made an equity investment of  to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
we are entitled to additional revenues upon achievement of specified milestones by gpc and pharmion  which are generally based on regulatory and sales milestones  and royalties on worldwide sales  if any  of the product 
the term of the license agreement expires on a product by product and country by country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire patents granted in each country covering such product  although some obligations  such as provisions relating to confidentiality and indemnification  survive termination 
in addition  the license agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in some cases either in whole or on a product by product and or country by country basis  based upon material breach of the terms of the license agreement by or the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other party  or by gpc upon six months notice to us 
generic drugs we hold the rights to certain andas that we filed with the fda for several tablet and injectable generic products 
we are currently working on selling these assets 
business alliances strategic business alliances are an important part of the execution of our business strategy 
we currently do not have any manufacturing or distribution capabilities 
we generally direct and pay for all aspects of the drug development process  and consequently incur the risks and rewards of drug development  which is an inherently uncertain process 
to mitigate such risks and address our manufacturing and distribution needs  we enter into alliances where we believe our partners can provide strategic advantage in the development  manufacturing or distribution of our drugs 
in such situations  the alliance partners may share in the risks and rewards of the drug development and commercialization 
we have entered into product development and manufacturing  and sales  marketing and distribution alliances for some of our drug products and intend to enter into additional alliances in the future 
key product development and manufacturing alliances are described elsewhere in this report along with the product descriptions 
please see item a risk factors for a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on business alliances to enhance our capabilities 
sales  marketing and distribution with the exception of the distribution of sumatriptan injection  expected to be launched by par on our behalf in  we do not currently have any exclusive distribution arrangements 
we are in the process of building a sales and marketing infrastructure to prepare for the launch of levoleucovorin  which was approved by the fda on march  however  we are also exploring strategic opportunities with third parties to assist us in the sales  marketing and distribution of levoleucovorin 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving biotechnology and intense competition 
we expect biotechnological developments and improvements in the fields of our business to continue to occur at a rapid rate and  as a result  expect competition to remain intense 
many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
biotechnologies under development by these and other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for the diseases and disorders for which we are 
table of contents developing our own treatments 
in the event that one or more of those programs are successful  the market for some of our drug products could be reduced or eliminated 
any product for which we obtain fda approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share 
competition for proprietary products competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying therapeutic innovations 
successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice  group practices  hospitals and academic institutions  and managed care organizations 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
unless our proprietary products are shown to have a better safety profile  efficacy and cost effectiveness as compared to other alternatives  they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and may therefore never be successful commercially 
companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our products target include ardana bioscience  neurocrine biosciences  abraxis bioscience  inc  astra zeneca lp  amgen  inc  bayer ag  bioniche life sciences inc  eli lilly and co  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  ferring pharmaceuticals  neorx corporation  genentech  inc  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  sanofi aventis  inc  pfizer  inc  avi biopharma  inc  genta inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems incorporated  millennium pharmaceuticals  shire pharmaceuticals  tap pharmaceuticals  inc  qlt inc  abbott laboratories  poniard pharmaceuticals  inc  roche pharmaceuticals  schering plough  johnson johnson and others who may be more advanced in development of competing drug products or are more established and are currently marketing products for the treatment of various indications that our drug products target 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
as noted above  we plan to launch our proprietary product  levoleucovorin  in mid  levoleucovorin is the levo isomeric form of the racemic compound calcium leucovorin  a product already approved for the same indications our product is approved for 
leucovorin has been sold as a generic product on the market for a number of years 
there are a number of generic companies currently selling the product 
if we are not able to demonstrate a competitive advantage over generic leucovorin  we may not be able to obtain a price premium over generic leucovorin 
if we are not able to obtain a price premium  we may not be able to manufacture levoleucovorin in a cost effective manner or at a cost below the generic leucovorin cost price 
also  levoleucovorin will be offered as part of a treatment regimen  and that regimen may change to exclude levoleucovorin 
competition for generic products the generic drug market is extremely price competitive and revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic drug products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents and regulatory exclusivity for brand name products expire  if a generic manufacturer has first to file status as described below under paragraph iv certification or has an authorized generic  such generic manufacturer generally enjoys a period of exclusivity with respect to other manufacturers of the generic drug  and can achieve significant market penetration 
however  as competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases  dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenues and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
companies that have a significant generic presence include par pharmaceutical companies  inc abraxis biosciences  inc  bedford laboratories  mayne  barr laboratories  teva pharmaceuticals  dr 
reddy s 
table of contents laboratories  ranbaxy laboratories  mylan laboratories  inc  sandoz a division of novartis  and watson pharmaceuticals  inc as noted above  we have the right to market authorized generic versions of sumatriptan injection products in the united states 
we expect to launch our products in the fourth quarter of prior to the expiration of the pediatric exclusivity period associated with sumatriptan injection

research and development research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  license fees and milestone payments  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drug products  and allocations of corporate costs 
research and development expenditures  including related stock based charges  are expensed as we incur them and were approximately million in  million in  and million in as follows years ended december  amounts in thousands levoleucovorin eoquin ozarelix ortataxel other drugs total direct costs indirect costs total research development patents and proprietary rights our patents  proprietary rights and andas we in license from third parties certain patent and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary products 
in particular  we have licensed patent rights with respect to levoleucovorin  eoquin  ozarelix  ortataxel  satraplatin  elsamitrucin  lucanthone  renazorb and spi  in each case for the remaining life of the applicable patents 
except for ozarelix and levoleucovorin  our agreements generally provide us with exclusive worldwide rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and commercialize the drug products 
under these license arrangements  we are generally responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs related to the drug products 
in addition  these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably exploit the underlying technology of applicable patents 
if we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements  we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products  which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business 
the protection  preservation and infringement free commercial exploitation of these patents and related intellectual property rights is very important to the successful execution of our proprietary drug strategy 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
accordingly  our patents and the patents we have in licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents 
if our patent applications are not allowed or  even if allowed and issued as patents  if such patents or the patents we have in licensed  are circumvented or not upheld by the courts  our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 

table of contents from time to time  we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market our products 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented 
as mentioned above  we have in licensed from third parties certain patent rights related to our proprietary products 
we believe that our patents and licenses are important to our business  but that with the exception of the united states and european patents discussed in this paragraph  relating to our proprietary products  no one patent or license is currently of material importance to our business 
for levoleucovorin  we have one united states formulation patent that covers levoleucovorin that expires in for eoquin  there is a composition patent that has already expired in in various countries in europe and that will expire in in the united states 
we have filed and plan to file additional united states and foreign patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for ozarelix  there is a united states composition patent that will expire in  and method of use and formulation patent applications on file in the united states 
for ortataxel  there are two united states composition patents that will expire in  and the corresponding european patents will expire in we anticipate filing new method of use and formulation patent applications for the ortataxel product in the future 
there are two united states patents covering satraplatin  a composition patent that expires in and a method of use patent that expires in  and foreign composition patents in europe that will expire in various countries between and for elsamitrucin  we have filed united states and foreign formulation and method of use patent applications  and we anticipate filing future united states and foreign patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for lucanthone  there is a united states method of use patent that expires in  and we anticipate filing future united states and foreign patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for renazorb  there are pending united states and foreign patent applications covering compositions of matter directed to treating hyperphosphatemia 
for spi  we have filed method of use patent applications in the united states and europe 
for spi  there is a united states composition and method of use patent that expires in this patent expires in certain european countries in we also have a united states method of use patent that expires in and there is ongoing prosecution for its european counterparts 
we have also filed another method of use patent application in the united states and europe and anticipate filing future patent applications pending the continued development of new methods of use and new formulations 
we are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and are currently prosecuting patent applications for our drug products and are considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products 
while the united states and the european union are currently the largest potential markets for most of our proprietary drug products  we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the united states and europe 
limitations on patent protection in these countries  and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the united states  may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the united states 
in addition  laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the united states 
to minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection  we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the united states  the european union  canada and japan 
in determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country  we weigh the relevant costs and benefits  and consider  among other things  the market potential and profitability  the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability  and the nature of terms with any potential licensees 
failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets 
in addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above  we have trademark protection in the united states for eoquin and renazorb 
we will likely register trademarks for the branded names of our proprietary drug products if any are approved for marketing 
spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc tm and iso vorin tm are trademarks owned by spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc  and eoquin is registered trademark of spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc renazorb is a registered trademark of altair nanomaterials  inc  and licensed to spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc all other trademarks  tradenames and service marks are the property of their respective owners 
in conducting our business generally  we rely upon trade secrets  know how  and licensing arrangements and use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or know how 
table of contents will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the protection of know how is particularly important because the know how is often the necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary drug products 
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation concerning patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain 
see item a risk factors for more information 
in connection with andas filed on behalf of jb chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd  and fdc  ltd  we have the exclusive license to market and distribute those drugs within the united states  if and when approved by the fda 
we own the andas for carboplatin injection  sumatriptan injection and our other andas 
the patent process the united states constitution provides congress with the authority to provide inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries 
congress codified this right in united states code title  which gave the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a united states patent 
this process involves the filing of a patent application that teaches a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms 
the invention must be novel not previously known and non obvious not an obvious extension of what is already known 
the patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention 
the uspto undertakes an examination process that can take from one to five years  or more  depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination 
in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public  the successful patent applicant is currently provided a right to exclude others from making  using or selling the claimed invention for a period of years from the effective filing date of the patent application 
under certain circumstances  a patent term may be extended 
patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the drug price competition and pricing term restoration act of  or commonly known as the hatch waxman act  to recover some of the time lost during the fda regulatory process  subject to a number of limitations and exceptions 
the patent term may be extended up to a maximum of five years  however  as a general rule  the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years 
only one patent can be extended per fda approved product  and a patent can only be extended once 
regulatory exclusivities the fda has provided for certain regulatory exclusivities for products whereby the fda will not approve of the sale of any generic form of the drug until the end of the prescribed period 
the fda will grant a year period of exclusivity for a product that contains a chemical entity never previously approved by the fda either alone or in combination with other drugs 
in addition  the fda will grant a year period of exclusivity to a new drug product that contains the same active drug substance that has been previously approved such as a new formulation of an old drug product 
also  as an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to research the safety and efficacy of their brand name drugs for use in pediatric populations  congress enacted the food drug administration modernization act of  which included a pediatric exclusivity for brand name drugs 
this pediatric exclusivity protects drug products from generic competition for six months after their patents expire in exchange for research on children 
for example  if a pharmaceutical company owns a patent covering a brand name drug  they can only exclude third parties from selling generic versions of that drug until that patent expires 
however  if the fda grants a brand named drug pediatric exclusivity  the fda will not approve a generic drug company s anda and thus not allow the sale of a generic drug for six months beyond the patent term covering the brand name drug 
thus  the pediatric exclusivity effectively extends the brand named company s patent protection for six months 
this extension applies to all dosage forms and uses that the original patent covered 

table of contents paragraph iv certification in  congress enacted the hatch waxman act in part to establish a streamlined approval process for the fda to use in approving generic versions of previously approved branded drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  for each patent listed in the fda orange book  where branded companies are required to list their patents for branded products  for the relevant branded drug  an anda applicant must certify one of the following claims that there is no patent information listed  that such patent has expired  that the proposed drug will not be marketed until expiration of the patent  or that either the proposed generic drug does not infringe the patent or the patent is invalid  otherwise known as paragraph iv certification 
if an anda applicant files a paragraph iv certification  the hatch waxman act requires the applicant to provide the patent holder with notice of that certification and provides the patent holder with a day window  during which it may bring suit against the applicant for patent infringement 
if patent litigation is initiated during this period  the fda may not approve the anda until the earlier of months from the patent holder s receipt of the notice the month stay or the issuance of a final  non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of the anda  the patent holder could seek an injunction to block the launch of the generic product until the patent expires 
often more than one company will file an anda that includes a paragraph iv certification 
however  the hatch waxman act provides that such subsequent anda applications will not be approved until days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
thus  the hatch waxman act effectively grants the first filed anda holder days of marketing exclusivity for the generic product

orphan drug designation some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states or more than  individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the united states a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the united states for that drug 
in the united states  orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity  which means the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity 
also  competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity 
under european union medicines laws  criteria for designation as an orphan medicine are similar but somewhat different from those in the united states 
orphan medicines are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity  except under certain limited circumstances comparable to united states law 
during this period of market exclusivity  no similar product  whether or not supported by full safety and efficacy data  will be approved unless a second applicant can establish that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior 
this period may be reduced to six years if the conditions that originally justified orphan designation change or the sponsor makes excessive profits 
our drug product levoleucorvin has been granted orphan drug designations for its use in conjunction with high dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma and for its use in combination chemotherapy with the approved agent fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum colorectal cancer 
final approval of orphan drug status is granted after approval of the product in the applicable indication 

table of contents governmental regulation the production and marketing of our proprietary and generic drug products are subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation 
the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  as amended from time to time  and the regulations promulgated there under  as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our proposed products 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework  including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to regular inspections by the fda and must comply with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with cgmps and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in certain of such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
general information about the drug approval process the united states system of new drug approval is one of the most rigorous in the world 
only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization 
our strategy focuses on in licensing clinical stage drug products that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
a late stage focus helps us to effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many hurdles in the pre clinical and early clinical process 
the following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary drugs 
pre clinical testing during the pre clinical testing stage  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug compound against the targeted disease and the compound is evaluated for safety 
investigational new drug application after pre clinical testing  an investigational new drug application is submitted to the fda to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug 
phase clinical trials after an investigational new drug application is accepted by the fda  phase human clinical trials can begin 
these trials  typically involving small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients usually define a drug candidate s safety profile  including the safe dosage range 
phase clinical trials in phase clinical trials  studies of human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug s effectiveness 
these studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels  dose schedules and route s of administration  and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on humans  as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following phase phase clinical trials this phase usually involves large numbers of patients with the targeted disease 
during the phase clinical trials  physicians monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long term use of the drug on a large  more widespread  patient population 
during the phase clinical trials  typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease 
new drug application or nda after completion of all three clinical trial phases  if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective  a new drug application is filed with the fda requesting fda approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease 
fast track review the fda has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious life threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
phase clinical trials after a drug has been approved by the fda  phase studies are conducted to explore additional patient populations  compare the drug to a competitor  or to further study the risks  benefits and optimal use of a drug 
these studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the nda 

table of contents abbreviated new drug application  or anda an anda is the abbreviated review and approval process created by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of signed into law in part for the accelerated approval of generic drugs 
when a company files an anda  it must make a patent certification regarding the patents covering the branded product listed in the fda s orange book 
an anda applicant must make one of four certifications that there is no patent information listed in the orange book  that the listed patent has expired  that the listed patent will expire on a stated date and the applicant will not market the product until the patent expires  or that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product 
the anda must also demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio equivalence the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug in the body is substantially equivalent to the brand name product  unless a bio equivalence waiver is granted by the fda 
the anda drug development and approval process generally takes less time than the nda drug development and approval process since the anda process does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product 
approval if the fda approves the nda or the anda  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe to patients for treatment 
the marketing of a drug after fda approval is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the fda  including regulation of adverse event reporting  manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the drug 
failure to comply with fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas  andas or other product applications  enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item a risks factors our failure to comply with governmental regulation may delay or prevent approval of our products and or subject us to penalties 
the generic drug enforcement act of established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
under this act  the fda has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs 
the fda may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and or withdraw approval of an anda and seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of any pending nda  anda or other regulatory submissions under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery and illegal gratuities policy 
if fraud or discrepancies are discovered  the fda may significantly delay or suspend substantive scientific review of a pending application during validity assessment or remove approved products from the market until the assessment is complete and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved 
to approve an application  the fda generally must determine that the applicant is capable of producing a safe and  for some types of applications  an effective or functional product based on  among other things  testing and other data provided by the applicant and the adequacy of the applicant s manufacturing processes and controls 
the principal basis for this determination is the data in the application  therefore  the reliability of data is of critical importance 
if the agency determines that the criteria for approval cannot be met because of unresolved questions regarding reliability of data  the agency will not approve the application 
if an application is denied  a new application will be accepted after completion of corrective action and sanction against individuals involved in the fraudulent activity 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 

table of contents continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing 
foreign regulation whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure  which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
this authorization is a marketing authorization approval  or maa 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization  which is granted by a single european union member state  may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
this procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure  or mrp 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
we face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us 
third party reimbursement and pricing controls in the united states and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
it will be time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare and private payers 
our products may not be considered cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
the passage of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs  which may affect the marketing of our products 
in many foreign markets  including the countries in the european union  pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
employees the efforts of our employees are critical to our success 
we believe that we have assembled a strong management team with the experience and expertise needed to execute our business strategy 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel as needs dictate to implement our growth strategy 
as of december   we had employees  of which held a md degree and held a phd degree 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we regard our relations with our employees to be good
