item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development  manufacturing and commercialization of important medicines for patients with cancer and other life threatening conditions 
we operate in three business segments products  royalties and contract manufacturing 
we have a portfolio of four marketed products  oncaspar  depocyt  abelcet and adagen 
our drug development programs utilize several cutting edge approaches  including our industry leading pegylation technology platform used to create product candidates with benefits such as reduced dosing frequency and less toxicity 
our pegylation technology was used to develop two of our products  oncaspar and adagen  and has created a royalty revenue stream from licensing partnerships for other products developed using the technology 
enzon also engages in contract manufacturing for several pharmaceutical companies to broaden the company s revenue base 
results of operations effective december   we changed our fiscal year end from june to december the discussion and analysis that follows covers our results of operations and cash flows for the three years ended december  and because of the change in fiscal year  the full year information was compiled from our transition report on form k for the six months ended december   our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  and our quarterly report on form q for quarter ended march  quarterly data were not audited 
summary level overview year ended december  compared to total revenues of million were unchanged in compared to products segment revenues remained constant as a group 
a reduction in fourth quarter royalty revenues from peg intron due to the sale of a interest therein was offset by a rise in contract manufacturing revenues for the year 
income before tax for the year ended december  was million compared to million in major operating factors contributing to the rise were the gain on the sale of the royalty interest of million partially offset by million of restructuring costs 
company wide spending on research and development rose approximately million in compared to  but acquired in process research and development expenditures of million experienced in were not repeated in other major effects include million of legal costs related to securing the supply of oncaspar raw material in  not incurred in  a million gain on sale of equity securities in not recurring in and lower interest expense in of million compared to  due to the refinancing and repurchases of our debt 
summary level overview year ended december  compared to total revenues rose million for the year ended december  to million from million in full year the largest component of total revenues is product sales which grew by in the year ended december  to million 
total revenues reflect four full quarters of royalties in versus approximately three quarters in contributing to a higher increase than actual growth in royalty activity 
there was a one quarter deferral of royalty revenue in to improve the recognition process 
income before tax for the year 
table of contents ended december  was million as compared to a loss before income tax of million for the twelve months ended december  our financial results in were significantly impacted by the write down of intangible assets and goodwill totaling million 
the one quarter deferral in royalty revenue recognition in also affected comparisons of operating results 
further discussion of these and other revenue and profitability fluctuations is contained in the segment analyses that follow 
the percentage changes throughout this management s discussion and analysis are based on thousands of dollars and not the rounded millions of dollars reflected throughout this section 
following is a reconciliation of segment profitability to consolidated income loss before income tax millions of dollars overview year ended december december december products segment profit loss royalties segment profit contract manufacturing segment profit loss corporate and other expenses income loss before income tax includes million gain on sale of interest in peg intron royalties 
impairment losses of million in the products segment related to goodwill and abelcet intangible assets and million in the contract manufacturing segment related to goodwill were recognized in december we do not allocate certain corporate income and expenses not directly identifiable with the respective segments  including exploratory and preclinical research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  investment income  interest income  interest expense or income taxes 
research and development expense is considered a corporate expense unless it relates to an existing marketed product or a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs would be chargeable to one of our operating segments

table of contents revenues sales performance of individual products is provided below millions of dollars year ended december december december product change change oncaspar depocyt abelcet adagen totals year ended december  compared to net product sales of million for are largely unchanged on an aggregate basis from the total reached in  however  the composition of sales by product reflects some significant shifts 
sales of our lead oncology agent  oncaspar  grew million or for the year ended december  to million compared to the growth in volume of oncaspar during was approximately 
the us food and drug administration fda approved oncaspar for the first line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all in july the increase in oncaspar sales is attributable to the continued transition to its first line use and the adoption of protocols in pediatric and adult patients some of which call for dosage regimens that will include a greater number of weeks of oncaspar therapy 
there was also an april  price increase 
sales of depocyt  for treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  and adagen  for the treatment of severe combined immuno deficiency disease  tend to fluctuate from period to period due to their small patient bases 
sales of depocyt increased to million or in from million last year whereas sales of adagen decreased in to million from million in as noted last year  adagen sales in were somewhat elevated due to a newly negotiated distributor contract and that distributor adjusting inventory levels in line with industry norms 
both depocyt and adagen were impacted by an april  price increase 
in april  the fda granted full approval of depocyt 
originally  depocyt was conditionally approved under the fda s sub part h regulation 
abelcet  our intravenous antifungal product  experienced sales in the us and canada that were lower for the year ended december  at million than the million recorded for the year ended december  due to continued competition from the numerous therapeutics in the anti fungal market 
year ended december  compared to net product sales of million in the year ended december  represented growth over net product sales of million in the year ended december  the growth was primarily attributable to volume increases of approximately each for oncaspar and adagen 
the continued decline in sales of abelcet was more than offset by growth in our other products 
sales of oncaspar grew to million or for the year compared to million in the growth of oncaspar was mainly attributable to its continued adoption in certain protocols by hospitals and cooperative groups 
on july   we announced the approval of oncaspar for the first line treatment of patients with all 
sales of depocyt increased to million in from million in due to pricing 
abelcet sales in the us and canada declined in compared to in the face of continued competition from current and new therapeutics in the anti fungal market 
adagen experienced growth in sales of from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of a newly negotiated contract with our distributor and the distributor s establishment during the fourth quarter of of inventory levels in line with industry norms 

table of contents cost of product sales in  cost of products sold rose as a percentage of net sales to approximately from in in december  we entered into supply and license agreements with ovation for the active ingredient used in the product of oncaspar 
a resulting license fee of million caused a million increase in amortization expense charged to oncaspar cost of products sold 
in  the raw material component of the oncaspar cost of goods will increase  as we start to sell product that has been manufactured using the active ingredient purchased through the new supply agreement with ovation 
higher supplier costs of materials and negative production variances contributed to lower adagen and abelcet margins  respectively  in also  the ongoing transfer of production of oncaspar and adagen from our south plainfield  new jersey facility to our indianapolis  indiana facility  discussed under restructuring below  resulted in million of cost related to required production test batches to validate the new production processes and assure continued product quality and stability 
in the year ended december   cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales remained relatively stable overall at when compared to the year ended december  oncaspar royalty costs were significantly reduced in by million due to the january  negotiated lowering of royalties with sanofi aventis 
offsetting this  in part  was a million increase in amortization resulting from the intangible that arose from the million payment made to sanofi aventis in connection with the royalty reduction 
some inventory write offs were also experienced in relation to oncaspar  but other production costs were lower as a percent of sales resulting in a net improvement in margins for the product 
abelcet costs were favorably affected by the december write down of related intangibles and the consequent lowering of amortization expense in as compared to also  abelcet inventory write off losses experienced in were not repeated in these improvements in abelcet cost of sales were largely offset by lower margins in adagen due to the write off of certain batch failures 
depocyt margins remained relatively unchanged 
research and development expenses products segment research and development spending increased by in to million from million in our existing marketed products are in the later stages of their respective life cycles 
for this reason  research and development spending related to marketed products has been directed largely towards securing and maintaining a reliable supply of the ingredients used in their production primarily in the production of oncaspar and adagen 
in august  we initiated a phase i clinical trial of oncaspar to assure its safety and potential utility in the treatment of advanced solid tumors and lymphomas in combination therapy 
as announced in february  the oncaspar solid tumor trial in combination therapy reached dose limiting toxicities 
the data are currently being analyzed to better understand whether the combination of oncaspar and gemzar warrants further development in solid tumors and lymphoma 
research and development spending on marketed products is expected to continue 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  as well as other commercial expenses and marketing programs to support our sales force 
also included in selling and marketing expenses are the costs associated with our medical affairs function  including a medical science liaison group 
selling and marketing expenses declined to million in when compared to million in  due primarily to lower promotional costs this year 
in late  we realigned our sales territories to improve the efficiency of our sales force 
we continue to make selective investments in selling  marketing and medical affairs 

table of contents the aggregate spending on selling and marketing expense of million during the year ended december  remained relatively constant compared to million in the same period of oncaspar expansion due to the first line approval for all announced in july was a key focus 
we also supported a repositioning of abelcet during amortization of acquired intangibles amortization expense of approximately million in and million in was principally related to abelcet intangible assets 
during the quarter ended december   we recognized an impairment write down of nearly all abelcet related assets amounting to million see write down of goodwill and intangibles below 
this write down significantly reduced periodic amortization expense in the year ended december  from million in the twelve months ended december  write down of goodwill and intangibles the majority of our intangible assets prior to had been acquired in november with the acquisition of abelcet 
by late and into  abelcet sales had declined from historical levels and a long term strategic plan completed in november indicated that it was unlikely sales would recover to prior levels 
in light of this impairment indicator  we engaged an independent valuation specialist  duff and phelps  to assist us in determining the fair value of the abelcet asset group and test for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
initial testing disclosed that the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset group were insufficient to cover the carrying value of the abelcet related intangibles 
the fair value of these intangible assets was then calculated and a non cash impairment charge was recognized in the products segment for the excess of carrying amount over fair value in the aggregate amount of million during the quarter ended december  effective in the quarter ended december   we changed the manner in which we manage and evaluate the performance of our operations which resulted in a change to our business segmentation and the identification of our related reporting units 
this new segmentation necessitated the allocation of our existing goodwill to the newly identified reporting units on a relative fair value basis 
further  we considered the historical declining performance of the abelcet products and the impairment recognized of the related intangible assets to be indicators that our products segment goodwill may be impaired 
with the assistance of duff and phelps  we determined the fair value of our reporting units  to assist us with the allocation of our goodwill and estimate the fair value of currently marketed product intangibles 
the allocation process resulted in the products segment being assigned million of goodwill 
the ensuing testing to estimate the implied fair value of this goodwill disclosed that it was impaired in its entirety 
accordingly  a non cash impairment loss related to goodwill was recorded in the amount of million in the products segment during the quarter ended december  restructuring during the first quarter of  we announced plans to consolidate our manufacturing operations in our indianapolis  indiana location 
this action was taken as part of our continued efforts to streamline operations 
all operations at our south plainfield  new jersey facility are expected to be transferred to our indianapolis facility in  resulting in the incurrence of certain restructuring and exit costs 
among these costs will be employee severance and related benefits for affected employees estimated to be million 
these amounts are expected to be paid in upon the successful transfer of production to our indianapolis facility and closure of our south plainfield facility 
severance charges and related benefits of million have been recognized through december  we expect to incur other costs during related to the relocation of goods and equipment  which will be recognized when costs are incurred 

table of contents certain assets consisting primarily of manufacturing equipment that will not be transferred to the indianapolis facility  nor continue to be used in manufacturing at the south plainfield facility were decommissioned during accordingly  we recognized the remaining depreciation totaling million on these assets during in the three months ended june   million  the cost of required validation batches at our indianapolis facility for both oncaspar and adagen  was expensed and included in cost of product sales 
there were no charges for validation batches during the other quarters of we may experience costs associated with the lease termination or the subleasing of the south plainfield facility 
such costs will be incurred and recognized when we cease use of the property in however  we do not know at this time what the final use or disposition of the leased south plainfield facility will be 
additionally  during  we recognized million of employee severance and related benefits when we combined our previous two specialized sales forces into one sales team 
this  in addition to severance costs of million and equipment write downs of million associated with the manufacturing consolidation  discussed above  brought total restructuring charges to million 
royalties segment royalties segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december december december change change royalty revenue nm gain on sale of royalty interest nm segment profit nm nm nm not meaningful the majority of total royalties is comprised of royalty revenue we receive on sales of peg intron  a peg enhanced version of schering plough s alpha interferon product  intron a  which is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
total royalties also include other royalty revenue and certain license revenues related to the application of our technology to other firms products 
for example  under an agreement we have with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar  osi pharmaceuticals has sublicensed our pegylation technology for use in macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration  an eye disease associated with aging that destroys central vision 
nektar also has a sublicense with hoffmann la roche relating to pegasys  a treatment for hepatitis c 
we receive a share of the royalties nektar receives from osi pharmaceuticals and hoffmann la roche 
we recognize royalty revenue when it is reasonably determinable and collection is reasonably assured which  beginning with the quarter ended december   is the notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
the one quarter deferral of royalty revenue recognition had no effect on our cash flows but has inhibited period to period revenue comparisons 
the years ended december and reflect royalties earned on underlying sales made in the twelve month period october of the preceding year through september of the current year whereas  the year ended december  reflects royalties on sales made january through september  the impact on revenue comparisons is discussed below 

table of contents total royalty revenue of million for the year ended december  was lower than the million reported during the year ended december  the decline was primarily attributable to the fact that the company sold a interest in royalties payable to it by schering plough corporation on net sales of peg intron occurring after june  in our fourth quarter of  because of the one quarter lag in royalty revenue recognition and the sale of of the revenue stream  we reported just of the total royalty revenues generated from sales of peg intron for quarter ended september   compared to full recognition in all quarters of apart from the decrease in percentage of royalties received  there was a modest rise in sales of peg intron 
increased pegasys royalties were offset by the effects of competition for macugen in the us the gain on the sale of the interest in peg intron royalties  net of related costs  was million 
the purchaser of the royalty interest will be obligated to pay an additional million to us in the first quarter of if it achieves a certain threshold level of royalties on sales of peg intron occurring from july  through december  the million contingent gain will be recognized when and if the contingency is removed and collection is assured  however  at this time  we do not anticipate that the threshold will be reached 
the year ended december reflected a full year s revenues whereas the one quarter deferral of royalty revenue discussed above resulted in the year ended december representing essentially just three quarters revenues 
peg intron sales continued to grow in as a result of its launch in japan 
however  as anticipated  schering plough reported a decline in peg intron sales in japan in the fourth quarter of as new patient enrollment moderated as a result of increased competition 
macugen also experienced significant competition from a newly approved agent as anticipated 
the future revenues to be received from the use of our technology are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control such as competition and the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees 
these factors include the approval of new agents like cimzia and hematide  new uses and geographies for peg intron and increased competition 
also  the sale of a interest in future peg intron royalties will lower royalty revenues commensurately 
costs and expenses current royalty revenues do not require any material specific maintenance costs 
at some point in the future  costs associated with initiation of new outlicensing agreements that could result in our receipt of a royalty stream and  if necessary  costs necessary to maintain the underlying technology may be charged to the royalties segment 
contract manufacturing segment contract manufacturing revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from the manufacture of myocet and abelcet for cephalon for the european market  and to a lesser extent  the manufacture of an injectable multivitamin  mvi  for mayne pharma  ltd  a division of hospira  inc contract manufacturing segment profitability millions of dollars year ended december december december change change revenues cost of sales write down of goodwill nm segment profit loss nm nm not meaningful 
table of contents revenues contract manufacturing revenue for the year ended december  rose to million over the million recorded in reflecting  in part  management s efforts to generate additional business in this segment and the reflection of a full year of business under two contracts entered into near the end of the two referenced contracts entered into in involve the production of research materials 
accordingly  we cannot be certain we will be able to sustain the level of revenue we experienced during the year ended december  million versus million in 
also  the revenue amount was adversely affected by a million billing adjustment 
contract manufacturing revenue remained unchanged at million between and declines in international sales of abelcet related revenues were largely offset by growth in mvi and myocet 
abelcet international revenues were down  in part  due to declining demand but also due to a billing adjustment that resulted in a reduction of million 
cost of sales cost of sales for contract manufacturing  as a percentage of sales  was approximately for the year ended december  as the above referenced million billing adjustment lowered sales but had no effect on that year s costs  the ratio of costs to sales was negatively affected 
without that effect  cost of sales for contract manufacturing would have been more consistent in with the percentage and with the of sales recorded in write down of goodwill in the quarter ended december   the contract manufacturing segment was allocated million of goodwill in connection with the redefinition of segments described above in the products segment 
a similar test  as described above  for impairment disclosed that the full amount of goodwill allocated to contract manufacturing was impaired and  accordingly  was written off 
non us revenue we had export sales and royalties recognized on export sales of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  sales in europe and royalties recognized on sales in europe  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our non us product sales and royalties are denominated in us dollars and are included in total revenues 

table of contents corporate and other expenses millions of dollars year ended december december december change change research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development nm restructuring nm other income expense interest expense investment income  net other  net nm nm nm nm corporate costs nm not meaningful research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  patent filing fees  contractor and consulting fees  principally related to clinical and regulatory projects  costs related to research and development partnerships or licenses  drug supplies for clinical and preclinical activities  as well as other research supplies and facilities charges 
research and development expenses related to currently marketed products are excluded from these corporate amounts and are reported in the products segment 
our research and development expense is considered a corporate expense until a product candidate enters phase iii clinical trials at which time related costs would be chargeable to one of our operating segments 
we continue to invest in research and development to build a differentiated oncology business through the continued development of our current portfolio  reinforcing our position as a scientific leader in pegylation through our customized linker technology tm platform 
for the full year of  research and development spending was million as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to spending in on the new programs initiated during we filed an investigational new drug ind application and opened two phase i trials for peg sn also  we opened two phase i trials in the hif alpha antagonist subsequent to the ind filing in the quarter ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we accepted two of the additional six oncology compounds licensed from santaris pharma a s santaris which prompted a million milestone payment 
in addition  compensation expense was affected by new hires and by the july  adoption of share based compensation rules that required a charge to expense for stock options and nonvested share awards 
this affected to comparisons due to the successive layering in of amortization of post adoption grants 

table of contents the significant increase in research and development spending during reflected a number of key initiatives undertaken to expand and improve our product pipeline 
expenditures rose to million in included in the amount was a million payment to tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation formerly inex pharmaceuticals related to the termination of our partnership for the development of an oncology product 
excluding these costs from the comparison  the underlying growth in research and development spending year over year was even more significant 
ind applications were filed during relating to recombinant human mannose binding lectin and the hif alpha antagonist for solid tumors 
the clinical trials underlying these and other research efforts accounted for much of the increased spending in in addition  the ind filing in december related to hif alpha which filing was approved by the fda in january triggered a million license milestone payment to santaris 
this amount was recorded in research and development expense in one additional ind was filed during the costs associated with this have been included in the products segment as it relates to oncaspar 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  salaries and benefits for support functions  and allocations of facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  of million were lower by from levels of million whereas spending in was up over the million recorded in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million in legal costs incurred in connection with securing the supply of the raw material used to produce oncaspar 
the absence of this expense in the succeeding and preceding years largely explains the decline in general and administrative expense from to of million and the majority of the increase from to of million 
the other significant influence on year to year comparisons during this three year interval is the earnings impact resulting from the july  adoption of share based compensation rules 
the cost of officer and director share based compensation is recognized in the general and administrative expense caption causing it to be felt most significantly here 
for a period of three to four years after adoption of the new rules  we will experience incrementally higher share based compensation expense as amortization of additional grants is layered into the computations 
the effect of the new accounting rules was greater in the comparisons because they were in place for twelve months of versus six months in acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development for the year ended december  was comprised of payments totaling million to santaris for rights to a total of eight rna antagonists based on lna locked nucleic acid technology 
acquired in process research and development of million for the twelve months ended december  was attributable to the execution of a license agreement with natimmune a s natimmune in september for the clinical development of recombinant human mannose binding lectin rhmbl 
as each of these technologies was in the developmental stage at the time of acquisition  the payments were charged to operations 
subsequent milestone payments related to these agreements are charged to research and development 
other income expense other income expense for the three years ended december   and was expense of million  income of million and expense of million  respectively 
the refinancing of a significant portion of our long term debt in affected the year to year comparisons in a number of manners refer to liquidity and capital resources below 

table of contents interest expense was million for compared to million for the reduction in interest expense is attributable to the lowering of the effective interest rate on our outstanding notes payable through the refinancing in and subsequent repurchases of our notes 
outstanding notes payable at the beginning of in the amount of million bore interest at 
in  million principal amount  of these notes was repurchased using the proceeds of our may issuance of million notes 
the net result of these transactions was to replace million of notes with million notes  resulting initially in an annualized interest cost savings of approximately million 
additional repurchases of our notes  including million principal amount during  have taken place over the past year and a half  reducing the outstanding balance as of december  to million  further contributing to savings of interest expense 
additional repurchases of the notes were made during january of reducing the outstanding balance to million as of january  the notes will be fully repurchased or repaid on or before of july  interest expense rose during to million from million in due primarily to the write off of million of deferred offering costs in connection with the repurchase of a portion of our notes 
net investment income decreased by million to million for from million for due principally to the sale in january and february of our remaining  shares of nektar therapeutics  inc common stock which resulted in a net gain of million 
net investment income for increased over due to the gain of million realized in on the sale of our remaining shares of nektar common stock 
in addition  we had more investments outstanding in at higher interest rates than in the same period of other  net was income of million for  compared to income of million for the change resulted primarily from a million gain on the repurchase of the notes during in  we realized a million gain related to repurchases of our notes 
concurrent with the issuance of new notes due  we used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase million principal amount of notes due at a purchase price of million resulting in a gain of million reflected in other  net 
during the twelve months ended december   we realized a loss of million related to the sale of nps pharmaceuticals nps common stock we received under a june merger termination agreement and a financial instrument we entered into to reduce our exposure to the change in fair value associated with such shares 
income taxes during  we recorded a tax expense of approximately million  which represents federal  state and canadian tax liabilities and includes an adjustment to taxes payable 
a federal income tax provision was recorded for representing federal alternative minimum tax primarily related to the gain on sale of a royalty interest recognized in the third quarter of our adoption  as of january   of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  had no effect on income tax expense 
in accordance with fin  as amended  tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return 
we have no tax positions relating to open income tax returns that we consider to be uncertain 
income tax expense of million for is comprised of certain state and canadian taxes 
no federal income tax expense was recorded due to the utilization of deferred tax assets 
for the twelve months ended december   the net income tax provision was million 
this was almost entirely the result of the establishment of a full valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets in june based on our assessment that it was not likely we would realize a future benefit from those assets 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources aggregate cash reserves rose to million as of december  from million at december  cash reserves include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  restricted investments and cash and marketable securities 
cash received on sale of a interest in peg intron royalties of million million less related transaction costs  represented the largest single cash inflow and offset expenditures to redeem a portion of the outstanding balance of the notes payable million  invest in property and equipment million and make payment for oncaspar product rights acquired in december million 
the remaining increase in cash reserves arose principally from operating income as adjusted for noncash items and fluctuations in working capital balances 
total cash reserves  as of december  were million greater than the million balance as of december  positive operating cash flows for the year ended december  and cash proceeds of million from the sale of nektar common stock contributed to the increase in cash reserves 
partially offsetting these cash inflows was the january payment to sanofi aventis of million relating to a reduction of the oncaspar royalty rate and the million payment to santaris for their technology rights 
cash provided by operating activities in of million exceeded that in by million 
this was due primarily to the rise in operating income  as adjusted for noncash items  of million in compared to million in  or an increase of million 
the largest single factor in this increase from year to year was the million net proceeds in on the sale of future peg intron royalties referred to above 
offsetting this cash inflow  in part  was the comparative change in operating assets and liabilities year over year aggregating to million 
in  reductions in accounts payable and increased investment in inventories constituted uses of cash  offset by a higher level of accrued expenses and other changes in operating assets  resulting in a net use of cash of million 
during  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily an increase in accounts payable  had a positive effect on operating cash of million 
cash used in investing activities in of million was lower than the million expended in due primarily to the fact that  in  we made net incremental investments in marketable and equity securities of approximately million 
we also had greater investments in in product rights and in process research and development million in versus million in 
offsetting this trend was an increase in investments in property and equipment in of million when compared to the prior year 
financing activities in and related almost entirely to the repurchase and refinancing of our long term debt as described below 
the repurchase of a portion of the notes payable constituted a use of cash in of million and the net result in of issuing the notes and partial repurchase of the notes was a source of cash of million 
cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the primary elements in the million improvement year over year were improved operating earnings plus net cash inflows relating to changes in operating assets and liabilities in compared to net cash out flows relating to operating assets in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in addition to investments in short term investments and marketable securities  we acquired million of property and equipment  million of in process research and development and million of product rights 
financing activities in provided a source of cash in the amount of million reflecting the net favorable effects of refinancing a portion of our long term debt as described below and million of stock option exercises 
in  the repurchase of notes payable used million of cash 
as of december   we had outstanding million of convertible senior notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of and million of convertible subordinated notes payable that bear interest at an annual rate of 
interest is payable on june and december for the notes and january and july for the notes 
accrued interest on the notes was million and million  as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents during  we repurchased million principal amount of notes for million 
the second quarter issuance of the notes generated million of gross financing cash inflows million in may and million in june 
we incurred million of costs in connection with the note issuances including legal  accounting and underwriting fees 
the net proceeds of the note issuance were used to repurchase million face value million in may and million in july of notes outstanding at a purchase price of for each  principal amount plus accrued interest 
the combined purchase price was million and accrued interest amounted to million 
our board of directors has authorized us to  and we may  make additional privately negotiated repurchases of the notes from time to time at the discretion of our senior management 
for a more detailed description of the terms of our convertible subordinated notes see contractual obligations below 
our current sources of liquidity are our cash reserves  interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of oncaspar  depocyt  abelcet and adagen  royalties earned which are primarily related to sales of peg intron  and contract manufacturing revenue 
as a result of the sale in the third quarter of  of a interest in future royalties payable to us on sale of peg intron occurring after june   cash flows from royalties earned have been affected accordingly beginning in the fourth quarter of based upon our current planned research and development activities and related costs and our current sources of liquidity  we anticipate our current cash reserves and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future 
as indicated above  total cash reserves include restricted investments and cash 
these dedicated funds amounted to million at december  fully covering the million principal amount of notes payable july  while we believe that our current sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operational needs for the near future  we may enter into agreements with collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of products that could increase our cash requirement or seek additional financing to fund future operations and potential acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we will need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our significant debt level may adversely affect our ability to do so 
failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any off balance sheet spe transactions 
our notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and pose a reasonable likelihood of potential significant dilution 
the maximum potential dilutive effect of conversion of the notes is million shares 
the notes have a conversion price of per share 
consequently  dilution related to the notes is remote 
the notes are discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources above and contractual obligations below 
in addition  stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and million restricted stock units were outstanding at december   that represent additional potential dilution 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our notes payable  including interest  operating lease obligations  inventory purchase obligations and our license agreements with collaborative partners 

table of contents as of december   we had million of convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these notes mature on june  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted

our convertible notes are payable on july  and our convertible notes are payable on june  critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues revenues from product sales and contract manufacturing revenue are recognized when title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
we recognize revenues for abelcet at the time of shipment by our third party distributor to the wholesaler 
sales are recorded when oncaspar and depocyt are shipped by our third party distributor directly to the end user 
we recognize revenue for adagen upon sale to our specialty distributor 
for product sales we also record a provision at the time of shipment for estimated future credits  chargebacks  sales discounts  rebates and returns 
these sales provision accruals  except for rebates which are recorded as a liability  are presented as a reduction of the accounts receivable balances 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the accruals by comparing the actual payments to the estimates used in establishing the accruals 
we provide chargeback payments to the wholesalers based on their sales to members of buying groups at prices determined under a contract between ourselves and the member 
administrative fees are paid to buying groups based on the total amount of purchases by their members 
we estimate the amount of the chargeback that will be paid using a distribution channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers  which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel  and b historical trends  adjusted for current changes 
the settlement of the chargebacks generally occurs within three months after the sale to the wholesaler 
we regularly analyze the historical chargeback trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends 

table of contents in addition  state agencies that administer various programs  such as the us medicaid programs  receive rebates 
medicaid rebates and administrative fees are recorded as a liability and a reduction of gross sales when we record the sale of the product 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we use a channel information obtained from certain of our wholesalers  which allows us to determine the amount and expiry of inventory in the distribution channel  b our historical medicaid rebate and administrative fee payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales  and c any significant changes in sales trends 
current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  and the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid patients are also evaluated 
factors that complicate the rebate calculations are the timing of the average manufacturer pricing computation  the lag time between sale and payment of a rebate  which can range up to nine months  and the level of reimbursement by state agencies 
the following is a summary of gross to net sales reductions that are accrued on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in thousands december  december  accounts receivable reductions chargebacks cash discounts other including returns total accrued liabilities medicaid rebates administrative fees total grand total royalties under our license agreements with third parties are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the licensee net of future credits  chargebacks  sales discount rebates and refunds and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information is generally received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
at the request of the customer  certain contract manufacturing arrangements involve the transfer of title of the finished product to the customer prior to shipment 
the product in question is manufactured to the unique specifications of the customer and cannot be used to fill other orders 
if all necessary conditions are met  including the product is complete and ready for shipment  the risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the customer pays for storage of the product at our facility  we will recognize revenue 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned  upon the occurrence of contract specified events 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be not realized 
as of december   we believe that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating 
table of contents activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain our position 
long lived asset impairment analysis long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present 
impairment indicators are events or circumstances that may be indicative of possible impairment such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  a current period operating loss combined with a history of operating losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
testing for the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets is performed initially by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flow stream exceeds the carrying amount  no further analysis is required 
however  if this test shows a negative relationship  the fair value of the assets within the asset group must be determined and we would record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
these evaluations involve amounts and forecasts that are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
share based payments effective july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  measured by the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
the impact such awards will have on our results of operations will be a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price of our stock at date of grant  combined with the application of the black scholes valuation model discussed below 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method which requires that compensation costs be recorded  as earned  for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding at june  acceleration of vesting of certain stock options in april and june had the effect of reducing the amount of compensation expense that would have to be recognized subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
r 
the years ended december  and  for example  were potentially benefited by million and million  respectively  with potentially million affect in the aggregate on and as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
options or stock awards issued to non employees and consultants are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and recognized over the related vesting or service period 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of the company s stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on historical enzon stock price information 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued two statements that would apply prospectively to potential  business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  early application is not permitted 
these pronouncements would be adopted at such time as we undertake a business combination and will have no impact on our current and historical financial statements 
sfas no 
r  business combinations  retains the fundamental requirements of purchase accounting but requires  among other 
table of contents things  the recognition and measurement of any noncontrolling interest and certain previously unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development 
it also calls for the recognition of most acquisition costs as expense rather than part of the total acquisition cost and the recognition of a gain in the event of a bargain purchase rather than negative goodwill 
sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
at its december  meeting  the fasb ratified a consensus of the emerging issues task force regarding the accounting for collaborative agreements eitf 
effective beginning in  the consensus prohibits participants in a collaborative agreement from applying the equity method of accounting to activities performed outside a separate legal entity and requires gross or net presentation of revenues and expenses by the respective parties depending upon their roles in the collaboration 
the consensus will be applied to collaborative agreements in existence at the date of adoption using a modified retrospective method that requires reclassification of all periods presented 
we are in the process of evaluating the possible impact the consensus may have on our financial statements  but do not expect it to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
the fasb has issued two pronouncements with effective dates primarily as of the first quarter of relating to measuring financial instruments at fair value 
we are in the process of evaluating the new standards but do not  at this time  anticipate that either will have any material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
certain financial statement disclosures will be revised  however  to conform to the new guidance 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements provides guidance on the use of fair value in such measurements and prescribes expanded disclosures about fair value measurements contained in financial statements 
once sfas no 
is adopted  sfas no 
can be adopted which allows companies the option to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a contract by contract basis 
as it relates to certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  the effective date of sfas no 
is the first quarter of the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus in june that non refundable advance payments to acquire goods or pay for services that will be consumed or performed in a future period in conducting research and development activities on behalf of the entity should be recorded as an asset when the advance payments are made eitf  accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
capitalized amounts are to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed  that is  when the goods without alternative future use are acquired or the service is rendered 
the consensus is to be applied prospectively to new contractual arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the effect of adoption of eitf  but do not expect it to be material to our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of available for sale securities are comprised of equity and debt securities  time deposits and auction rate securities 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest the majority of our investments in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
while auction rate securities have long stated maturities  interest rates are reset at intervals of up to days at which time they can be sold 
accordingly  they are considered to have current maturities 
the table below presents the amortized cost  fair value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our available for sale securities as of december  excluding primarily those related to our executive deferred compensation plan in thousands 
total fair value fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate our outstanding convertible notes have fixed interest rates 
accordingly the fair values of the respective issuances will fluctuate as market rates of interest move up or down 
fair values are also affected by changes in the price of our common stock 
our convertible senior unsecured notes in the principal amount of million at december  are due june  and have a fair value of million at december  
table of contents our convertible subordinated notes in principal amount of million at december  are due july  the fair value of these notes was approximately million at december
