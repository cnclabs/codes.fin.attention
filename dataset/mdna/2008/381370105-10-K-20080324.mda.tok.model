financial information about geographic areas during the years ended december  and  we operated primarily in the united states 
we had no material foreign operations in and employees as of february   we had employees  including hourly rate employees 
the number of hourly rate employees fluctuates depending upon the number and size of projects under construction at any particular time 
we have no unionized employees and believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
electrical construction through our subsidiary  southeast power corporation southeast power  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electrical facilities for utilities and industrial customers 
we also install fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
southeast power  based in titusville  florida  performs electrical contracting services in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
our electrical construction business includes the construction of transmission lines  distribution systems and substations and other electrical installation services for utility systems and industrial and specialty projects  including fiber optic cable installation which is primarily overhead optical ground wire and all dielectric self supporting cable 
our customers include many of the leading companies in the industries we serve 
representative customers include florida power light company progress energy lee county electric cooperative jea kissimmee utilities authority orlando utilities commission santee cooper central electric power cooperative in the fourth quarter of  pursuant to award after a competitive bid process  we were selected to partner with a major utility in a multi year project involving the upgrading of miles of high voltage kv transmission line to support load growth in the central florida area  on which work has commenced 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has come from one or two different customers each year 
our largest customers may change from year to year 
in the year ended december   our top five customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
since the contribution of a customer may vary from year to year  we cannot predict the future effect of the loss of any given customer 
it is our policy to commit ourselves only to the amount of work we believe we can properly supervise  equip and complete to the customer s satisfaction and schedule 
as a result of this policy and the magnitude of some of the construction projects undertaken by us  a substantial portion of our annual revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  the specific identity of which vary from year to year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detail on sales to major customers which exceed of total sales 
construction is customarily performed pursuant to the plans and specifications of customers 
we generally supply the management  labor  equipment and tools while materials are primarily supplied by our customers 
most projects have a duration of six months or less  although some contracts may extend beyond one year 
revenues and results of operations in our electrical construction business can be subject to seasonal variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  customer spending patterns and system loads 
the company primarily performs work in the southeastern united states 
electric utility customers normally perform their system upgrades and maintenance work during off peak seasons when the demand for electrical power is reduced  which is in the first two quarters of the year in the southeast region of the united states 
this pattern is apparent by the reduction in the number of active projects in the third quarter 
however  since hurricane season normally peaks during this period  this pattern can be offset with storm restoration work resulting from hurricane damage 

table of contents the electrical construction business is highly competitive 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
competitive factors include level of technical expertise and experience  industry reputation  quality of work  price  geographic presence  dependability  availability of skilled personnel  worker safety and financial stability 
our management believes that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services  or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we enter into contracts on the basis of either competitive bidding or direct negotiations with our customers 
competitively bid contracts account for a majority of our electrical construction revenues 
although there is considerable variation in the terms of the contracts undertaken  such contracts typically involve lump sum fixed price  or unit price time and material contracts 
however  many of our contracts do not require our clients to purchase a minimum amount of services  and many of our contracts are cancelable on short notice 
the magnitude and duration of projects undertaken by us vary  which may result in substantial fluctuations in our backlog from time to time 
backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
our backlog also includes certain service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
the projected backlog amounts for these service agreement contracts are based on our historical work from these customers 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
our backlog at december  was million  of which million is believed to be firm due to the nature of our fixed priced contracts and million of which is attributable to service agreements 
the total backlog is reasonably expected to be completed within the current year 
this compares to a backlog of million as of december  of which million was believed to be firm from fixed priced contracts and million of which was attributable to service agreements 
subsequent to december   we have received additional contracts totaling million of which million is expected to be completed in and million of which will be completed by early in certain circumstances  we are required to provide performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety to secure our contractual commitments 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
management is not aware of any performance bonds issued for us that have ever been called by a customer 
we currently believe that we will not have to fund any claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
we believe that we have adequate bonding availability for our operations as presently conducted 
as of december   outstanding performance bonds issued on behalf of our electrical construction subsidiary amounted to million 
generally  our customers supply most or all of the materials required for a particular contract and we provide the personnel  tools and equipment to perform the installation services 
however  with respect to a portion of our contracts  we may supply part or all of the materials required 
in these instances  we are not dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily utilize to complete the job 
we are not presently experiencing  nor do we anticipate experiencing  any difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of materials 
we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and rules regarding  among other things  contractor licensing  electrical codes  worker safety and environmental protection 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
the main administrative and maintenance facilities of southeast power are located on a acre tract of land near titusville  florida  which we own 
the office building is approximately  square feet 
the shop and maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
the south carolina division of southeast power owns its administrative and maintenance facilities  which are located on a acre tract of land in spartanburg  south carolina 
the office building is approximately  square feet and the maintenance facilities are approximately  square feet 
we believe that the aforementioned properties are currently in good condition and properly maintained 
real estate through our subsidiary bayswater development corporation and its various subsidiaries bayswater we are engaged in the acquisition  development  management  and disposition of land and improved properties 
the primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential condominium projects along the east coast of central florida 
over the past several years we have developed five condominium projects 
our current project  pineapple house  is an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units located in melbourne  florida  and is the first phase of a planned multi phase development 
our customers generally are pre retirement  retirement or second homebuyers seeking higher quality  maintenance free residences with generous amenities 
we acquire land for development only after feasibility and environmental testing has been performed 
generally  architectural and engineering plans for the projects are outsourced and the project plans are submitted to third party general building contractors for competitive fixed price bids to construct the improvements 
the sales process is conducted by outside real estate brokerages that best serve the specific markets where our projects are located 
in an effort to limit risk  our policy is to obtain a substantial number of contracts for sale  backed by customers non refundable earnest money deposits  prior to commencing construction on the condominium projects 
generally the minimum non refundable earnest money deposit is of the purchase price and is held in escrow by a third party until such time as the unit is closed and title to the unit has been transferred to the buyer 
we do not offer financing arrangements to purchasers of our condominiums 
we generally purchase land and pay for architectural  engineering and various other costs with cash reserves 
construction costs are generally financed with bank financing  as specified in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as of december   we had no projects under construction and no backlog outstanding real estate contracts for sale excluding partial revenue already recognized on said contracts under the percentage of completion method in the real estate segment compared to approximately million in backlog as of december  however  we own vacant property on which we plan to build two condominium buildings  which will comprise phase ii and phase iii of the pineapple house project 
although we have delayed the sales and construction of new projects  we believe the real estate market in our area will ultimately improve and we will resume our plans for this vacant property 
however  we can provide no assurance about the real estate market or our future plans 
our historical financial performance in real estate construction is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in particular  we expect financial results to vary from project to project and from quarter to quarter 
our revenue may therefore fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  and we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the real estate industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with numerous national and local real estate developers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors  including quality  location  design  perceived value  price and reputation in the marketplace 
we believe that we have certain competitive advantages including desirable locations  attractive designs and higher quality features not generally offered by other developers in the market in which we compete 
we are subject to federal  state and local statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations regarding  among other things  zoning  building permits  environmental standards  building moratoriums and building codes 
permits and approvals mandated by regulation for development of any magnitude are often numerous  significantly time consuming and onerous to obtain  and not guaranteed 
we believe that our real estate operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations 
the real estate division administrative offices are located within the corporate offices located in melbourne  florida 
discontinued operations effective november   we completed the sale of the capital stock of our mining subsidiaries  st 
cloud mining company and the goldfield consolidated mines company  to an unrelated party as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in september  we were notified by the united states environmental protection agency the epa that we are a potentially responsible party prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at the anderson calhoun mine mill site the site in stevens county  washington which was previously owned by us see item  legal proceedings 
in november  we learned that in october  the state of washington  as part of its effort to catalog abandoned mines  issued a report on the sierra zinc mine mill site the sierra site  also in stevens county  washington  which we may have owned or operated  and which we may have used to process a limited amount of ore from the site 
the report did not address any potential required remediation or reclamation 
the sierra site is currently listed on epa s comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability information system database cerclis 
although we are not aware of any threatened governmental or other action with respect to the sierra site  there can be no assurance that such action will not occur in the future 
item a 
risk factors 
our business involves various risks associated with the operations of our company 
to provide a framework to understand our operating environment  we are providing a brief explanation of the significant risks associated with our business 
although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors  others could emerge in the future 
each of the following risks could affect our performance 
risks related to our electrical construction operations we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small group of customers 
the loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
a significant portion of our electrical construction revenue is derived from a small group of customers  with one or two different customers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year 
for example  in the year ended december   our top five customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
the loss of one or more of these customers would  if not replaced by other business  result in a decrease in revenues  margins and profits which could be material 
the electrical construction industry is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  retain our customers or win new customers  our financial performance could be harmed 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
certain of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may  therefore  be able to provide their services at lower rates than we can provide 
many of our current and potential competitors  especially our competitors with national scope  also may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors 
if we fail to compete favorably with new or existing competitors  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents our business is affected by the spending patterns of our customers and adverse weather conditions  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
most of our work is performed outdoors and as a result  our results of operations can be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  including inclement weather due to tropical storms and hurricanes  which are most likely to occur in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
any weather related delays in the completion of  or which increase the cost of  our projects could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in any one or more of our reporting periods 
an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could reduce the demand for our services 
because a substantial portion of our electrical construction work is performed for customers in the electric utility industry  an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could impair the financial condition of many of our customers  which could cause them to reduce their capital expenditures and demand for our services  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
skilled labor shortages and increased labor costs could negatively affect our ability to compete for new projects 
in our electrical construction business  we have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel 
for example  currently there is a shortage of linemen capable of working on and supervising the construction of high voltage lines 
linemen are frequently recruited across geographic regions to satisfy demand  including for storm restoration work  which can exacerbate this shortage 
the commencement of new  large scale infrastructure projects  increased demand for infrastructure improvements and the aging utility workforce further deplete the pool of skilled labor available to us  even if we are not awarded such projects 
as a result of these factors  the supply of experienced linemen and supervisors may not be sufficient to meet our expected demand and we may not be able to allocate or hire sufficient project managers for new electrical construction projects 
we may also spend considerable resources training employees who may then be hired by our competitors  forcing us to spend additional funds to attract personnel to fill those positions 
if we were unable to retain sufficient qualified personnel at a reasonable cost  or at all  we would be unable to staff new and existing projects  which would reduce our revenues 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in critical accounting estimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein  a significant portion of our revenues in our electrical construction operations is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost method  which is standard for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
the cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in revenue or translate into profits 
backlog for our electrical construction operations at december  was million  which represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
this revenue is not guaranteed  however  as many of our customers may cancel their contracts with us on short notice typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
in addition  million of these uncompleted contracts are service agreements that contain multiple year terms which fall into the category of unit price contracts 
typically  these service agreements do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
for these service agreements  we project the backlog amount based on our historical work from each customer 
to the extent that our customers cancel their contracts with us or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason  we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated backlog 
furthermore  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
as a result  even if we realize all the revenue from the projects in our backlog  if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our projects are subject to numerous hazards 
if we do not maintain an adequate safety record  we may be ineligible to bid on certain projects  could be terminated from existing projects and could have difficulty procuring adequate insurance 
hazards experienced as a result of our electric construction operations include electrocutions  fires  mechanical failure and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause and have caused personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages  including blackouts  and may result in suspension of our operations on a project  large damage claims  and  in extreme cases  criminal liability 
at any given time  we are subject to workers compensation claims and claims by employees  customers and third parties for property damage  loss of life and personal injuries resulting from such hazards or other workplace accidents 
further  regulatory changes implemented by the occupational safety and health administration could impose additional costs on us 
notwithstanding our investment of substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and we may be unable to avoid accidents resulting from the hazards described above and the associated liability exposure  which may be significant 
furthermore  if serious accidents or fatalities were to occur or if our safety record were to deteriorate  we could become ineligible to bid on certain projects and could be terminated from existing projects  our reputation and our prospects for future projects could be negatively affected  and we could be required to expend additional resources on health and safety programs 
in addition  if our safety record were to significantly deteriorate  it would become more difficult and expensive for us to procure adequate insurance 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
in certain circumstances  we are required to provide performance bonds to secure our contractual commitments 
although to date we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding  if we were unable to obtain surety bonds in the future  or were required to post collateral in order to obtain surety bonds  our ability to obtain new contracts would be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents risks related to our real estate development operations we engage in real estate activities which are speculative and involve a high degree of risk the real estate industry is highly cyclical by nature and future market conditions are uncertain 
factors which adversely affect the real estate and homebuilding industries  many of which are beyond our control  include the availability and cost of financing  unfavorable interest rates and increases in inflation  overbuilding or decreases in demand  changes in national  regional and local economic conditions  cost overruns  inclement weather  and labor and material shortages  the impact of present or future environmental legislation  zoning laws and other regulations  availability  delays and costs associated with obtaining permits  approvals or licenses necessary to develop property  and increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees 
the homebuilding and condominium industry is in the midst of a significant downturn 
a continuing decline in the demand for condominiums coupled with an increase in the inventory of available condominiums and other homes could adversely affect our sales volume and pricing even more than has occurred to date and  as a result  could reduce our earnings 
the homebuilding industry is in the midst of a significant downturn 
as a result  we have experienced a decline in demand for new condominiums 
homebuilders inventories of unsold new homes of all types have increased as a result of increased cancellation rates on pending contracts as new homebuyers sometimes find it more advantageous to forfeit a deposit than to complete the purchase of the home 
in addition  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  has depressed prices and reduced margins 
this combination of lower demand and higher inventories affects both the number of condominiums that we can sell and the prices at which we can sell them 
for example  in  we experienced a significant decline in our sales results  reductions in our margins and a higher than normal cancellation rate 
we have no basis for predicting how long supply and demand will remain out of balance in the market where we operate or whether  even if demand and supply come back in balance  sales volumes or pricing will return to prior levels 
changes in national and regional economic conditions  as well as local economic conditions where we conduct our real estate development operations and where prospective purchasers of our condominiums live  can have a negative impact on our business 
adverse changes in employment levels  job growth  consumer confidence  interest rates and population growth may reduce demand and depress prices for our condominiums 
this  in turn  can reduce our earnings 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for homebuyers  interest rates  consumer confidence  levels of new and existing homes for sale  demographic trends and housing demand 
if adverse conditions affect any of our markets  they could have a proportionately greater impact on us versus other homebuilding companies 
an excess supply of housing  including homes held for sale by investors and speculators  can also lower new home prices and reduce our gross margins on new home sales 
as a result of the foregoing  potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our condominiums  or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
we may be unable to change the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways 
in addition  cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers sentiment changes and they may fail to honor their contracts  as occurred in the multifamily housing industry is highly competitive and  if others are more successful  our business could decline 
we operate in a very competitive environment  which is characterized by competition from a number of other real estate developers 
we compete with large national and regional development companies and with smaller local firms for land  financing  raw materials and skilled management and labor resources 
we also compete with the resale  or previously owned  condominium market 
increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and or reduce our prices 
increased competition could also result in an oversupply of condominiums or other housing alternatives available for sale  which could depress the prices at which we can sell our condominiums  and increase the length of time it takes us to sell them 
if a failure to compete effectively resulted in our selling fewer condominiums at lower prices  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if we do not receive cash corresponding to previously recognized revenues  our future cash flows could be lower than expected 
over the last few years  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we recognize revenues and profits from sales of condominium units during the course of construction 
revenue recognition commences and continues to be recorded when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a full refund of its deposit except for non delivery of the residence  a substantial percentage of units are under non cancelable contracts  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured and costs can be reasonably estimated 
due to various contingencies  like delayed construction and buyer defaults  as occurred in  we may receive less cash than the amount of revenue already recognized or the cash may be received at a later date than we expected  which could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
for sales of condominiums 
eitf no 
will require condominium sales to meet the continuing involvement criterion of sfas no 
in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage of completion method 
eitf no 
will be 
table of contents effective for our fiscal year beginning january  this consensus could require that additional deposits be collected by developers of condominium projects that wish to recognize profit during the construction period under the percentage of completion method 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of eitf no 
on future projects  we will be required to delay revenue recognition until the aggregate investment tests described in sfas no 
and eitf no 
have been met  which will reduce the potential effects of this risk 
if land is not available at reasonable prices  our sales and earnings could decrease 
our real estate development operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for the development of our residential condominiums 
changes in the general availability of land  competition for available land  availability of financing to acquire land  zoning regulations that limit housing density and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential developments 
if the supply of land appropriate for development of our residential condominiums becomes more limited because of these factors  or for any other reason  the cost of land could increase  which could reduce the profitability of our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our condominiums  and the number of condominiums that we build and sell could be reduced  which would reduce our revenues 
if the market value of our land and developments drops significantly  our profits could decrease 
the market value of our land and condominium inventories of our real estate development operations depends on market conditions 
we acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current market 
if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory  we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past  may experience less than anticipated profits and may not be able to recover our costs when we sell our property or finished product 
in the face of adverse market conditions  we may have substantial inventory carrying costs or may have to sell land or completed units at a loss  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  if there is a decrease in demand for condominiums such that the market value of a condominium is less than purchase price reduced by the deposit made by a buyer  the buyer may elect to forfeit their deposit to the company and have no further obligation to purchase the condominium resulting in a loss of revenue  operating income and a possible write down of condominiums in inventory 
in  as the market deteriorated  we had thirteen buyers default on their contracts and forfeit their deposits 
as the market continued to stagnate  we determined it was necessary to reduce our selling prices for the remaining units and  as a result  recorded a write down of  related to condominium units held for sale 
government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our developments  increase our expenses or limit our building activities  which could have a negative impact on our operations 
we must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our real estate development operations  and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority 
we incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements 
any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs  as discussed below 
various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning building  zoning  sales and similar matters apply to and or affect the residential multifamily industry 
municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities  such as water and sewer taps 
in some areas  municipalities may enact growth control initiatives  which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year 
this governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities  mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers 
the industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations which limit the availability or use of land 
we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law 
further  we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed developments  whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties 
increases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs  and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for our condominiums 
increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space  road improvements  or to provide low and moderate income housing  could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our condominiums 
in addition  increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide  as a result  not to purchase one of our condominiums 
in addition  any changes in the income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing  which in turn could reduce our sales and adversely affect our revenues 
our business is concentrated in florida  which increases our exposure to local adverse events 
in our real estate development operations  we currently develop and sell condominiums only on the east coast of florida 
as a consequence  our exposure to local adverse events  such as natural disasters or changes in economic conditions  is increased 
in particular  florida is affected by tropical storms and hurricanes  which can damage or destroy buildings  including condominiums 
the occurrence of such a storm or other natural disaster could result in delays in construction and shortages and increased costs of labor and building materials 
any such delays or additional costs could adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development operations 
additionally  a number of insurance carriers have opted either not to write insurance in florida at all or to only renew existing policies and not to write new policies 
these practices have resulted in substantial increases in the cost of insurance  a widespread shortage of available private insurance for property owners in florida and the creation of a state joint underwriting association 
the state provided insurance coverages generally afford less protection at greater costs than typically provided by private insurance carriers 
the inability of property owners to obtain cost effective insurance could have an adverse effect on demand for property in our markets  which could reduce our revenues 
furthermore  there are periods of time during which insurance companies will not write policies because of the presence of a named storm that may pass over the areas in which we sell condominiums 
during these periods  home closings in areas that could be affected by such a storm will be delayed until the risk of the storm has passed and the required insurance can be obtained 

table of contents adverse weather conditions and conditions in nature beyond our control could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
in our real estate development operations  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  floods and fires  can have serious effects on our ability to perform work 
we also may be affected by unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems 
any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in the completion of  or increase the cost of  our projects and  as a result  could adversely affect our sales  earnings and profitability 
in addition  approaching storms require that sales  development and construction operations be suspended in favor of storm preparation activities such as securing construction materials and equipment 
after a storm has passed  construction related resources such as sub contracted labor and building materials are likely to be redeployed to hurricane recovery efforts around the state 
governmental permitting and inspection activities may similarly be focused primarily on returning displaced residents to homes damaged by the storms  rather than on new construction activity 
depending on the severity of the damage caused by the storms  disruptions such as these could last for several months 
if we experience shortages of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control  there could be delays or increased costs in developing our condominiums  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to develop residential condominiums may be affected by circumstances beyond our control  including work stoppages  labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people  such as carpenters  roofers  electricians and plumbers  lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services  our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured  and shortages  or delays in availability  or fluctuations in prices of  building materials 
any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our condominium projects 
if we are not able to recover these increased costs by raising the prices of our condominiums we might decide to postpone or cancel the development of condominium projects on which we have not yet begun construction 
if that happens  our operating results could be harmed 
additionally  we may be limited in the amount we can raise sales prices by our customers unwillingness to pay higher prices 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly  which could adversely affect our business 
as a real estate developer  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims  which can include bodily injury claims and mold related property damage claims among others  are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high  and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited 
there can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims  we may experience losses that could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition  which could be material 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing for the development of our projects 
if we are not able to obtain suitable financing  our costs would increase and our revenues would decrease  or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels 
increases in interest rates can make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business  which would have an adverse affect on our profitability 
if our potential customers are not able to obtain suitable financing  our business may decline 
our real estate development operations also depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our condominiums 
during  the mortgage lending industry experienced significant instability 
as a result of increased default rates  particularly but not entirely with regard to sub prime and other non conforming loans  many lenders have reduced their willingness to make and tightened their credit requirements with regard to  residential mortgage loans 
fewer loan products and stricter loan qualification standards may make it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of our condominiums 
increases in the cost of home mortgage financing could prevent our potential customers from purchasing our condominiums 
in addition  where our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a condominium from us  increases in mortgage costs could prevent the buyers of our customers existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete the purchase  which could result in our potential customers inability to buy a condominium from us 
if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing  our sales and revenues could decline 
we depend upon the availability and skill of general contractors and subcontractors 
substantially all our construction work is done by subcontractors working for a general contractor we select for a particular project 
accordingly  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of those subcontractors 
we do not have long term contractual commitments with any particular general contractor  subcontractors or suppliers 
although we believe that our relationships with our general contractors  subcontractors and suppliers are good  we cannot assure you that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available to us at reasonable rates 
the inability to contract with skilled subcontractors or general contractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could limit our ability to build and deliver condominiums and could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our real estate development operations 
additionally  if there is an impairment  bankruptcy or default by the general contractor or subcontractors our production  revenue and operating income may be adversely affected 
we rely on outside professionals whose errors could increase our costs 
we often collaborate with numerous professionals such as architects  engineers and general contractors in the development of our real estate projects 
in the course of our business  we rely on the work of these professionals to help design and build the condominiums that we develop  and errors in their work can create significant increases in cost and delays in construction 

table of contents our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenues and operating results from real estate development operations are subject to fluctuations 
because we typically have only one or two projects under development at any time  factors such as the timing of the start of construction of new projects  the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction and others can cause our revenues and operating results to vary from period to period and from year to year 
accordingly  the historical financial performance of our real estate development operations is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results for any particular period  and quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
we may be subject to environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our properties 
the development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on our part as owner and developer  for our own acts as well as the acts of prior owners or owners or past owners of adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of our properties  we may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances 
should a substantial environmental hazard be found on any of our properties  our results of operations and the value of the contaminated property could be adversely affected 
acts of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business 
acts of war  any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power  including the armed conflict with iraq  or acts of terrorism  may cause disruption to the economy  our company  our employees and our customers  which could reduce demand for our condominiums and adversely impact our total revenues and earnings 
increased insurance risk could negatively affect our business 
insurance and surety companies may take actions that could negatively affect our business  including increasing insurance premiums  requiring higher self insured retentions and deductibles  requiring additional collateral or covenants on surety bonds  reducing limits  restricting coverages  imposing exclusions  and refusing to underwrite certain risks and classes of business 
any of these actions may adversely affect our ability to obtain appropriate insurance coverage at reasonable costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our business we could be adversely affected by the loss of key management personnel 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the efforts of our senior management  including those of our subsidiaries 
we believe that key members of our senior management possess valuable industry knowledge  relationships and experience that are important to the successful operation of our business 
the loss of such members of our senior management could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected by liabilities associated with our former mining business 
we completed the sale of the capital stock of our mining subsidiaries effective november  however  we could still be liable for previous activities at sites we once owned 
we have been identified as a prp for investigation and removal activities at one such site  as discussed in item herein 
the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
environmental on september   the epa issued a special notice letter notifying us that we are a prp  along with three other parties  with respect to investigation and removal activities at the site in stevens county  washington 
we sold the site property in we have investigated the historic operations that occurred at the site as well as the nature and scope of environmental conditions at the site that may present concerns to the epa 
based upon our investigation to date  we have determined that our operations at the site were primarily exploratory and that we never engaged in any milling or other processing activities at the site 
our records reflect that between the years and we extracted a limited amount  tons of surface ore from the site for off site processing 
the site has changed owners several times since we sold it  and we believe that a substantial majority of the mining activities and all of the milling and related processing and process waste disposal activities likely were conducted by subsequent owners 

table of contents on january   we  together with combustion engineering and blue tee corp  submitted to epa and other federal and state regulatory agencies a draft final engineering evaluation cost analysis report ee ca report 
in april  the epa approved as final the ee ca report for the site 
the ee ca report proposes to adopt as the preferred remedy a removal action primarily focused on addressing ore processing areas and wastes that were created after the company sold the site 
on or about october   epa issued an action memorandum that specifies the nature and scope of the response action that the agency will require with respect to the site 
the action memorandum adopted the preferred removal action from the ee ca report 
epa has indicated its intention to issue formal notice letters to us and the other prps regarding performance of the removal action set forth in the action memorandum or other form of settlement with the agency 
however  no formal letter has been received to date 
the epa has indicated that it hopes that response actions at the site will be completed during the construction season 
the ee ca report  following cost estimation procedures applicable to ee ca documents  estimates that the net present value of the proposed removal action is million 
this figure includes amounts for contingencies and is based on currently available information  certain assumptions and estimates 
in light of our limited role in the creation of the wastes that are the primary focus of the removal action  we believe that the other two prps  particularly blue tee corporation successor to american zinc should be liable for most of the cleanup costs  as they were directly responsible for all on site ore processing activities and wastes 
however  there can be no assurance as to the scope of our share of liability for cleanup costs 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  any of the prps may be jointly and severally liable to the epa for the full amount of any response costs incurred by the epa  including costs related to investigation and remediation  subject to a right of contribution from other prps 
in practice  prps generally agree to perform such response activities  and negotiate among themselves to determine their respective contributions to any such multi party activities based upon equitable allocation factors that focus primarily on their respective contributions to the contamination at issue 
it is impossible at this stage to estimate the total costs of the remediation at the site or our share of liability for those costs due to various factors  including incomplete information regarding the site and the other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of actual remediation costs and our equitable share of liability for the contamination

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction through our subsidiary southeast power corporation  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electric utility facilities for electric utilities and industrial customers  and the installation of fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies and electric utilities 
southeast power  based in titusville  florida  performs electrical contracting services in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
we are also involved through our subsidiary bayswater development corporation and its various subsidiaries in the acquisition  development  management and disposition of land and improved properties 
the primary focus of our real estate operations has been the development of residential condominium projects along the east coast of central florida 
over the past several years we have developed five condominium projects 
our current project  pineapple house  is an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units located in melbourne  florida  and is the first phase of a planned multi phase development 
overview our revenue from electrical construction operations decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to the reduction in the number of projects under construction this year because we have recently been less successful in the bidding and awards process  partly due to the number of jobs awarded to competitors at prices that would not meet our target profit margins 
operating margins of our electrical construction operations decreased to for the year ended december  from for the like period in  primarily the result of reduced productivity on several jobs due to clients transmission line clearance problems  delays in procurements of client furnished materials  delays in our clients processing permits on a timely basis and related transition costs and lost productivity as work crews were moved from one job to another due to these customer delays 
revenues from our real estate development operations decreased by for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this decrease is mainly due to the reversal of previously recognized revenues on the pineapple house project upon the notification from buyers of their intent to default on their purchase contracts 
real estate development operations had an operating loss of million in the year ended december   compared to operating income of million in the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this loss reflects the reversal of revenues and cost of sales due to the default on purchase contracts discussed above  as well as the write down of the pineapple house inventory to estimated fair value 
pineapple house  our current real estate project  is a multi phase project located in melbourne  florida 
the first phase is comprised of an eight story building containing thirty three luxury river view condominium units 
as of december   twenty two units were under contract for sale  backed by million of non refundable earnest money deposits 
due to the current weakness in the florida condominium market  as further described below  there was a virtual cessation of sales of our condominiums during  which continued through the nine months ended september   during which we made no additional sales for pineapple house 
in may  we received the certificate of occupancy for pineapple house and notified our contracted buyers to begin consummating the sales of the units 
of the twenty two units under contract for sale we closed on nine of these units 
the remaining thirteen buyers defaulted on their contracts  forfeiting deposits  aggregating  as a result of the defaults on these contracts  we reversed the previously recognized revenues and cost of sales on these units 
in september  as the market continued to stagnate  we determined it was necessary to reduce the selling prices for the remaining pineapple house condominium units  which resulted in an adjustment in the carrying value of these units and a write down of  related to the pineapple house condominium units held for sale 
since this reduction in selling prices  we have entered into contracts for sale with respect to seven units  six of which were consummated prior to december  we closed the sale of the remaining unit under contract in february in addition to the remaining units of phase i of pineapple house  we own vacant property on which we plan to build two condominiums  which will comprise phase ii and phase iii of this project 
although we have delayed the sales and construction of these additional phases of pineapple house  we believe the real estate market in our area will ultimately improve and we will resume our plans for this vacant property 
however  we can provide no assurance about the real estate market or our future plans 
additionally  we have three units in oak park  located in cape canaveral  florida in inventory 
oak park was completed in the rd quarter of operating margins from real estate development operations vary due to the type and number of units under construction at any given time 
since we historically have had only one or two projects under construction at any given time  operating margins can vary significantly depending upon the cost of the underlying land  the type of construction  location of the project and general market conditions 
in addition  our projects are generally completed in approximately one year  which also influences year to year operating margin comparisons 
looking forward with respect to our real estate development operations  we continue to see weak  and perhaps deteriorating  market conditions  which may continue to have an adverse impact on the sales and pricing of our condominium units  the settlement of existing contracts  the commencement and development of new projects including a delay in the commencement of the second phase of the pineapple house project and on the results of our real estate development operations 
we cannot predict whether the florida condominium market will improve  or when any such improvement may take place 
however  we have completed the first phase of the pineapple house project on budget and in a timely manner  and we believe the project is attractive and of high quality 
at the new reduced selling prices  we expect renewed sales activity at the pineapple house project  as has already been evidenced by seven sales at the new prices  discussed above 
furthermore  we will no longer be incurring construction costs with respect to this phase and our share of the maintenance costs on the unsold units is expected to be no more than  annually 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts  real estate development projects  deferred income tax assets and environmental 
table of contents remediation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies  estimates and related disclosure with the audit committee of the board of directors 
percentage of completion electrical construction segment we recognize revenue from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using primarily the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in productivity and scheduling  and the cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  site conditions and scheduling that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  a change in the availability and proximity of materials and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
due to our experience and our detailed approach in determining our cost estimates for all of our significant projects  we believe our estimates to be highly reliable 
however  our projects can be complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
if a current estimate of total costs indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
accrued contract losses as of december  and were  and  respectively 
revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is probable 
percentage of completion real estate development segment as of august  commencing with our second condominium development project  all revenue associated with real estate development projects that meet the criteria specified by sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue is recognized when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  a substantial percentage at least one third of the condominiums are under firm  non refundable contracts  except in the case of non delivery of the unit or interest  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  after considering the requirements of applicable state laws  the condominium contract  and the terms of applicable financing agreements  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured  deposits equal or exceed of the contract price  and sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
we determine that construction is beyond a preliminary stage when engineering and design work  execution of construction contracts  site clearance and preparation  excavation and the building foundation are complete 
in november  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 applicability of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
for sales of condominiums 
eitf no 
will require condominium sales to meet the continuing involvement criterion of sfas no 
in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage of completion method 
eitf no 
will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january  this consensus could require that additional deposits be collected by developers of condominium projects that wish to recognize profit during the construction period under the percentage of completion method 
the cumulative effect of applying eitf no 
 if any  is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the effect of this eitf is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements  as there are no projects currently under construction 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of eitf no 
on future projects  we will be required to delay revenue recognition until the aggregate investment tests described in sfas no 
and eitf no 
have been met 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that a material difference in total actual project costs versus total estimated project costs is unlikely due to the nature of the fixed price contracts we enter into with the general contractors on our real estate projects 
if a current estimate of total project costs indicates a loss on a project  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
there were no contract losses recorded during any period in and in the real estate development segment 
the timing of revenue and expense recognition is contingent on construction productivity 
factors possibly impeding construction productivity include  but are not limited to  supply of labor  materials and equipment  scheduling  weather  permitting and unforeseen events 
when a buyer defaults on the contract for sale  revenues and expenses recognized in prior periods are adjusted in the period of default 
in the year ended december   as a result of thirteen buyers defaulting on their purchase contracts  we recorded a reversal in revenues previously recognized of million and in costs of sales previously recorded of million 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered or settled 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the previously recorded valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents as of december   our deferred tax assets were largely comprised of an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward and inventory adjustments refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on historical experience and assumptions with respect to forecasts of future taxable income and tax planning  among others  we anticipate being able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the amt credit carryforward  which has no expiration date and the inventory adjustment will be recognized as condominium units are sold 
therefore  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
the minimum amount of future taxable income required to be generated to fully realize the deferred tax assets is approximately million 
provision for remediation in september  we were notified by the epa that we are a prp with respect to possible investigation and removal activities at a mine that we formerly owned 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this matter 
it is impossible at this stage to estimate the total costs of the remediation at the site or our share of liability for those costs due to various factors  including incomplete information regarding the site and the other prps  uncertainty regarding the extent of actual remediation costs and our equitable share of liability for the contamination 
beginning in september  in accordance with fin no 
and sop no 
 we have recognized a net expense within discontinued operations for this matter 
the provision was increased by  during the year ended december   increasing the cumulative net expense to  this represents the current estimate of our share of the costs associated with both an emergency removal action previously undertaken by the epa and actual remediation costs  the professional fees associated with the ee ca study and the anticipated professional fees associated with the completed remediation  all reduced by both actual and estimated insurance recoveries 
total actual costs to be incurred at the site in future periods may vary from this estimate  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental costs 
as of december   we have recorded a reserve balance for future applicable costs of  accrued as a current liability within discontinued operations 
the accrual will be reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time  which could result in changes to its amount

operating expenses also include any gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment 
operating income loss excludes interest expense  interest and other income  and income taxes 
revenues total revenues in the year ended december  decreased by to million  compared to million in the year ended december  this decrease in total revenues was mainly due to decreased revenues recognized in the electrical construction segment and the reversal of revenue  resulting in negative revenues  in the real estate development segment in each case  for the year ended december  electrical construction revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in is largely due to a slowdown in demand for our electrical construction services and a reduction in the number of projects in process  resulting from the availability of fewer profitable projects 
in the current year we had fewer projects under construction because we have recently been less successful in the bidding and awards process  partly due to the number of jobs awarded to competitors at prices that would not meet our target profit margins 
the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in our backlog from time to time 
at december  the approximate value of uncompleted contracts was million compared to million at december  we expect to complete of this backlog during the year ended december  subsequent to december   we have received additional contracts totaling million of which million is expected to be completed in and million of which will be completed by early we cannot project the levels of future demand for construction services 
real estate construction reported net revenues of  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the revenues consisted of million in revenues recognized on the pineapple house units with purchase contracts received prior to completion of the project  which closed as agreed upon after completion of the project  million in revenues received in the fourth quarter of upon the sale of six additional pineapple house units   collected from forfeited deposits   in revenues for the sale of one oak park unit and  in condo association dues received by pineapple house condominium association  inc phca  offset by the reversal of million of previously recognized revenues on the pineapple house project upon the notification from thirteen buyers of their intent to default on their contracts 
in the year ended december   we recognized revenue on both the oak park project  which was completed in the third quarter of and the pineapple house project  which we had begun in the first quarter of during the year ended december   the only project under construction was pineapple house 
as of december   due to the completion of phase i of the pineapple house project there was no backlog for the real estate development operation s segment 
operating results electrical construction operations had an operating income of  in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of million during the year ended december  operating margins on electrical construction operations decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in operating margins for the year ended december   when compared to the same period in  was largely the result of reduced productivity on several jobs due to clients transmission line clearance problems  delays in procurements of client furnished materials  delays in our clients processing permits on a timely basis and related transition costs and lost productivity as work crews were moved from one job to another due to these customer delays 

table of contents real estate development operations had an operating loss of million in the year ended december   compared to an operating income of million in the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this loss reflects the reversal of revenues and cost of sales due to the default on purchase contracts discussed above  as well as the write down of the pineapple house inventory to estimated fair value in the third quarter of totaling  costs and expenses total costs and expenses  and the components thereof  decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   a decrease of

liquidity and capital resources working capital analysis our primary cash needs have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our primary sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our lines of credit 
as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
in addition  we had million in unused revolving lines of credit as of december   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this cash on hand  our credit facilities and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our future operating needs and debt requirements 
cash flow analysis the following table presents our net cash flows for each of the years ended december as indicated net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities are comprised of income loss from continuing operations adjusted to reflect the timing of cash receipts and disbursements therefrom 
cash provided by our operating activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million from operating activities for the same period in our cash flows are influenced by the level of operations  operating margins  the types of services we provide  as well as the stages of our projects in both the electrical construction and real estate segments 
net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  is mainly attributed to cash received upon the completion and closing of the sales of the pineapple house condominiums  offset by the net loss for the current year 
operating cash flows normally fluctuate relative to the status of development of projects within both the real estate and electrical construction segments 
days of sales outstanding analysis we evaluate fluctuations in our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for the electrical construction segment by comparing days of sales outstanding dso 
we calculate dso as of the end of any period by utilizing the preceding three months of electrical construction revenues to determine sales per day 
we then divide accounts receivable and accrued billings  net of allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the period by sales per day to calculate dso for accounts receivable 
to calculate dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  we divide costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts by sales per day 
for the years ended december  and  our dso for accounts receivable were and  respectively  and our dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts were and  respectively 
the increase in the dso for accounts receivable for the year ended december  is primarily due to the payment patterns of several customers 
as of february   we have received of our december  outstanding trade accounts receivable balance and billed of the retainage 
the decrease in the dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings is primarily attributable to the current billing requirements of our customers 
as of february   we have invoiced our customers for of the balance in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings as of december  
table of contents investing activities cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million compared to cash used of million during the same period in these activities are mainly attributed to purchases of equipment  primarily trucks and heavy machinery used by our electrical construction segment for the upgrading and replacement of equipment

these purchases will be funded through our working capital  leases and lines of credit
