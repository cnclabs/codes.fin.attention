table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations have historically been focused on the onshore oil and natural gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
beginning in  the company continued to diversify its oil and natural gas exploration and development portfolio to include unconventional styled reserve properties with the addition of its east texas austin chalk play  and continuing in areas such as north central oklahoma and kentucky exploration and development opportunities 
declines in the existence of conventional exploration projects in very mature producing basins  such as south louisiana and the shallow shelf areas of the gulf of mexico  have impacted the number of economic prospects available for drilling 
this is partly the result of better technology that has improved the industry s ability to determine probabilities of success  and partly the result of new projects being smaller in size compared to the decline rates exhibited by the giant fields discovered  generally  prior to the s 
as a result  the company made a shift during and extended what had been a highly successful exploration program during the early s  from drilling purely deep  higher risk  yet higher potential prospects  to place more emphasis on the development of an exploration inventory of shallower  lower risk  repeatable  multi well plays 
this shift was the genesis of two very successful exploration plays thornwell and biloxi marshlands where multiple wells were drilled either just above pressures  or the first sands into geo pressures 
in both instances  the company developed processing and interpretation techniques that identified direct hydrocarbon indicators and developed reserves with probabilities of success levels greater than each 
meridian s management believes that south louisiana still contains both tremendous attributes high producing rates  high cash flows and returns  plus lower lifting costs once proved and remaining opportunities for a company  such as meridian  that possesses a unique position in the region a position marked by technical knowledge and expertise  relationships  acreage positions  seismic inventory and data and prospect inventory 
however  the fact remains that the replacement of reserves year after year in this region continues to be more and more difficult under current conditions 
with the recent increase in commodity prices  the industry is now experiencing a new paradigm in domestic exploration 
recent price increases and enhanced technology has enabled the industry  as a whole  to consider domestic exploration projects that were once uneconomic 
these are predominantly classed as unconventional tight gas and resource shale or resource material plays 
the barnett shale field in northern texas is the best  but not the only  example of this type of play 
it is estimated that as much as of current domestic production now stems from accumulation of this nature 
these fields are quite prolific  extend over large areas  but are also very cost sensitive  with breakeven costs often at per mcf or more on large capital investments 
in recognition of the totality of circumstances  including the availability of these styles of play opportunities and the company s high current cash position stemming from its higher producing rate gulf coast properties  in early  meridian s management introduced as a part of its business plan  the further expansion of its exploration program to include the identification and development of unconventional and resource plays into its portfolio 
since that decision  the company has entered into joint ventures and acquired strategic acreage positions in basins recognized for both the unconventional and resource exploration plays 
the company has expanded its technical and business development staff to include a team of experienced professionals and consultants who will be primarily responsible for the further extension of the company s reserve base and reserve life in the unconventional resource plays 

table of contents operations overview our four primary regions where the capital budget will be spent  and where we are currently active are east texas  south louisiana  north louisiana  and south texas 
east texas austin chalk meridian is on track with its plans to develop this growing core area 
the company originally acquired an interest in this play as a working interest owner in approximately  acres during mid year the original plan was to develop the woodbine sand section offsetting the prolific double a wells field 
additional objectives were the austin chalk and buda formations 
meridian was granted operatorship of the play and has since developed a current gross acreage position of approximately  contiguous acres in this play area 
this will provide enough acreage for a drilling inventory of up to possible dual lateral well locations 
since initial drilling starting in  the company has drilled or participated in the drilling of eight austin chalk wells six are producing  one is drilling  one is currently completing and about to be tested 
the aggregate gross proved reserves discovered as a result of the completed wells  including pud locations  equal over bcfe bcfe net to meridian 
average wells in the area reportedly recover approximately bcfe  with the best wells recovering as much as bcfe 
this play s contribution to the company s net proven reserve base has grown from to approximately over the course of the past months and is projected to be one of the top four cash flow producing fields in the company 
scheduled wells for are in the thicker  shallower chalk areas that are expected to produce higher oil ratios than the company s initial wells that were primarily focused on the original woodbine test locations 
as stated above  two wells are currently being drilled and completed in this area 
the bsm no 
well wi  has drilled two horizontal laterals with approximate lengths of  and  feet measured depth md  respectively 
currently a liner is being run in the second lateral and is expected to be completed and tested in the coming weeks 
the freeman no 
well wi has completed its first lateral at approximately  feet md 
the second lateral is currently at a length of approximately  feet md  going to a targeted  feet md in length 
the vertical depth of the austin chalk formation in this area is approximately  feet 
additionally  meridian participated in the outside operated bsm a no 
h  which was a single lateral well that reached a total depth of  md 
the well was recently tested at mmcf d with barrels of oil per day 
meridian holds approximately working interest in this well 
the key to this project is management of the cost of drilling and completing dual laterals within estimated cost levels and leveraging the large acreage position to increase production and reserves with continual drilling 
we have achieved these goals in a relatively short cycle and  in doing so  believe that with the addition of our recently acquired and constructed new drilling rig  we will be able to maintain a continuous drilling program within this region 
levering off the knowledge and experience of the company in this play  the company has expanded beyond its currently established boundaries to explore and test acreage located in two separate south central texas areas 
meridian is building leasehold positions and has budgeted four test wells in these areas for calendar year it is anticipated that in these areas  the production will have a higher liquid oil content than its current production in the initial wells in east texas 
the expanded play areas are unproven and in the early stage  therefore  as they are tested  the company will release additional details on these opportunities as they develop 
south louisiana south louisiana remains a core area for near term and long term upside for meridian 
weeks island field continues to be the company s largest oil field and render additional opportunities from new well locations  sidetracks and development drilling 
the company is currently reprocessing its d seismic data over weeks island and regions in its south louisiana play area  the expectations being that the re processed and newly acquired d data will enhance the company s generation of lower to moderate risk new projects in this core 
table of contents area where it is already active and has operations and production facilities in place 
currently  in the weeks island field  work is being done on the myles salt no 
development well located in iberia parish 
the well was re entered and is being sidetracked to approximately  feet md 
currently the well is drilling at approximately  feet md 
the targeted sands for this re entry are the o  p and q sands 
these are primarily oil based sands in the miocene formation 
meridian owns a working interest and is the operator of the well 
recently in the weeks island field  the goodrich cocke no 
well was recompleted in the bf sand in the miocene formation 
average daily production from the well is approximately barrels of oil equivalent 
flowing tubing pressure was measured at approximately  psi through a th inch choke 
the company is the operator and owns a working interest in the well 
north louisiana the company is in the early stages of establishing foothold lease positions in two different repeatable project opportunities in north louisiana 
meridian will release additional details on these opportunities as the plays develop 
new albany shale play in the new albany shale play in the illinois basin  two wells were drilled and tested during the fourth quarter of the first well  the farms of meadow hills no 
well was drilled to  feet  targeting the devonian new albany shale formation 
a second well  the keach no 
 was drilled to approximately the same depth  also targeting the new albany shale formation 
both wells were fracture stimulated and allowed to flow back the water used in the frac 
subsequent pumping of the load water off the formation resulted in the production of minor amounts of natural gas from each well 
the results of the completion process have not been economic to date  and the company is currently reviewing its options for this area for an additional test of its southern acreage position 
oklahoma in the mid continent area  the company tested the hunton de watering play and concluded that it did not fit the criteria of the company for near or long term economic growth 
the underlying assumptions as presented in this play were not achieved and therefore the company took advantage of the opportunity to sell the remainder of its acreage position in the area recouping relatively all of its costs for the leasehold position in this area for approximately million  the proceeds of which were received in although the last well drilled  the benkendorf no 
well appeared to be economic based on initial data points  the company concluded that the risk of development beyond this limited acreage to other positions in the area constituted too high of a risk and that it was more prudent to deploy the capital into other areas with less risk and better economics 
rig status the company s new rig  the triton  is anticipated to be delivered by the end of march to either the next well in the company s east texas austin chalk play  or one of the previously referenced wells in the south texas area 
orion drilling company  lp will be operating  maintaining and crewing two rigs used by meridian 
one of the rigs will be owned by meridian and one will be on a long term contract 
it is anticipated that orion s management and operations of the rigs will improve drilling efficiencies and costs for the wells it drills 
capital expenditure plans for the company anticipates a capital spending budget of approximately million for new prospect opportunities  ranging in depths from shallow to deep 
based 
table of contents on current projections  these expenditures are within the company s expected operating cash flows including cash on hand and allow the company the flexibility to take on additional prospects  acquisitions or joint ventures as the opportunities are presented or developed throughout the year 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  fluctuations in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas have several important consequences to us  including affecting the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
reserve estimates significantly impact depletion and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  bad debts  oil and natural gas properties  derivative contracts  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 

table of contents proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in our amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
changes in the quantities of our reserves could significantly impact the company s provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in reserves would have increased our provision for the year by approximately  however  a increase in our reserves would have decreased our provision for the year by approximately 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and natural gas industry conditions  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
at december   we had million allocated to unevaluated oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in the unevaluated oil and natural gas properties balance would have increased our provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties by approximately and a increase would have decreased our provision by approximately for the year ended december  full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  after deducting the asset retirement obligation  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
accordingly  based on september   pricing of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil  the company recognized in the third quarter of a non cash impairment of million million after tax of the company s oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
due to the imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and natural gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas 
table of contents properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
at december   we had a cushion ie the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs of million before tax 
a increase in prices would have increased our cushion by approximately 
a decrease in prices would have decreased our cushion by approximately 
our hedging program would reduce some of the impact of a price decline 
price risk management activities 
the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
cash flow hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various derivative contracts 
these contracts allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by sfas and any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item 
any changes in fair value resulting from the ineffectiveness of the hedge are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenues 
the company recognized a gain of  during the year ended december   a gain of  during the year ended december   and a loss of  during the year ended december  as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s oil and natural gas contracts was an unrealized loss of million million net of tax which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
based upon december   oil and natural gas commodity prices  approximately million of the loss deferred in other comprehensive income could potentially decrease gross revenues in the contract agreements expire at various dates through december  net settlements under these contract agreements increased decreased oil and natural gas revenues by   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively

fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
the standard applies prospectively to new fair value measurements performed after the required effective dates  which are as follows on january   the standard became applicable to measurements of the fair values of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities  on january   the standard will apply to all remaining fair value measurements  including non recurring measurements of non financial assets and liabilities  such as asset retirement obligations and impairments of long lived assets 
the company adopted the effective portion of sfas on january   we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
generally  sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations completed on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  provided we do not undertake a significant acquisition or business combination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility 
since interest charged on borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 

table of contents hedging contracts from time to time  meridian addresses market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
all of the company s current hedging contracts are in the form of costless collars 
the costless collars provide the company with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly based on the nymex futures contract 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of the company during the periods presented 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production during the respective terms of the hedging agreements 
the fair values of the hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the nymex future prices for the applicable trading months 
the fair values of our hedging agreements are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the estimated fair value of our hedging agreements as of december   is provided below see the company s website at www
