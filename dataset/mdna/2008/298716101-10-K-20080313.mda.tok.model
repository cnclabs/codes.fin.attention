the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wages  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  electronics  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery and equipment

environmental compliance in addition to our obligations under environmental laws with respect to property that we own  there are several federal and state statutes that govern the rights and obligations of financial institutions with respect to environmental issues 
in addition to being directly liable under these statutes for its own conduct  a financial institution may also be held liable under certain circumstances for the actions of borrowers or other third parties on property that collateralizes a loan held by the institution 
this potential liability may far exceed the original amount of the loan made by the financial institution  which is secured by the property 
currently  we are not a party to any legal proceedings involving potential liability under applicable environmental laws 
employees we had approximately full time equivalent employees as of december  our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified management and other personnel

supervision and regulation this following is a summary description of the relevant laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank and financial holding companies 
the descriptions of  and references to  the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries and do not purport to be complete 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
general the supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance funds of the fdic and the banking system as a whole  and not for the protection of the bank holding company stockholders or creditors 
the banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks  including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations 
legislation is from time to time introduced in congress and puerto rico s legislature  including proposals to overhaul the bank regulatory system  expand the powers of depository institutions and limit the investments that depository institutions may make with insured funds 
such legislation may change applicable statutes and the operating environment of eurobancshares and eurobank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations would have upon the financial condition and results of operations of eurobancshares or eurobank  or any of their subsidiaries 
on march   eurobancshares subsidiary bank  eurobank  entered into a stipulation and consent order with the fdic agreeing to the issuance of a cease and desist order 
the order was based upon examination results which indicated that the bank s bank secrecy act anti money laundering program was not fully in compliance with the requirements of the bsa laws  regulations  and guidance 
for additional information  see the section of this report captioned anti terrorism legislation on page eurobancshares eurobancshares is a financial holding company registered under the bank holding company act  and is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the federal reserve board 
the bank holding company act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage  and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities  including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations 
regulatory restrictions on dividends  source of strength eurobancshares is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from its other subsidiaries 
the principal source of our revenue is dividends received from eurobank 
various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends eurobank can pay to eurobancshares without regulatory approval 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
under federal reserve board policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support 
such support may be required at times when  absent this federal reserve board policy  a holding company may not be inclined to provide it 
as discussed below  a bank holding company  in certain circumstances  could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  the trustee will be deemed to have assumed  and is required to cure immediately  any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution  and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims 
activities closely related to banking the bank holding company act prohibits a bank holding company  with certain limited exceptions  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or from engaging in any activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks and certain other subsidiaries  or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries 
one principal exception to these prohibitions allows the acquisition of interests in companies whose activities are found by the federal reserve board  by order or regulation  to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks  as to be a proper incident thereto 
these activities include  among other things  numerous services and functions performed in connection with lending  investing  and financial counseling and tax planning 
in approving acquisitions by bank holding companies of companies engaged in banking related activities  the federal reserve board considers a number of factors  and weighs the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience and increased competition or gains in efficiency against the risks of possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 
the federal reserve board is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced through acquisition of a going concern 
gramm leach bliley act  financial holding companies the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of  revised and expanded the provisions of the bank holding company act by including a new section that permits a bank holding company to elect to become a financial holding company to engage in a full range of activities that are financial in nature 
the qualification requirements and the process for a bank holding company that elects to be treated as a financial holding company require that all of the subsidiary banks controlled by the bank holding company at the time of election to become a financial holding company must be and remain at all times well capitalized and well managed 
eurobancshares made an election to become a financial holding company on september  the gramm leach bliley act further requires that  in the event that the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  the election must be made by filing a written declaration with the appropriate federal reserve bank that states that the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company  provides the name and head office address of the bank holding company and each depository institution controlled by the bank holding company  certifies that each depository institution controlled by the bank holding company is well capitalized as of the date the bank holding company submits its declaration  provides the capital ratios for all relevant capital measures as of the close of the previous quarter for each depository institution controlled by the bank holding company  and certifies that each depository institution controlled by the bank holding company is well managed as of the date the bank holding company submits its declaration 
the bank holding company must have also achieved at least a rating of satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs under the community reinvestment act during the institution s most recent examination 
financial holding companies may engage  directly or indirectly  in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activity  or complementary to a financial activity provided it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the gramm leach bliley act specifically provides that the following activities have been determined to be financial in nature lending  trust and other banking activities  insurance activities  financial or economic advisory services  securitization of assets  securities underwriting and dealing  existing bank holding company domestic activities  existing bank holding company foreign activities and merchant banking activities 
in addition  the gramm leach bliley act specifically gives the federal reserve board the authority  by regulation or order  to expand the list of financial or incidental activities  but requires consultation with the united states treasury department  and gives the federal reserve board authority to allow a financial holding company to engage in any activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
privacy policies under the gramm leach bliley act  all financial institutions are required to adopt privacy policies  restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access 
eurobancshares and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act 
safe and sound banking practices bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the federal reserve board s regulation y  for example  generally requires a holding company to give the federal reserve board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation 
depending upon the circumstances  the federal reserve board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations  and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
the penalties can be as high as million for each day the activity continues 
annual reporting  examinations we are required to file annual reports with the federal reserve board  and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bank holding company act 
the federal reserve board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries  and charge the company for the cost of such the examination 
capital adequacy requirements the federal reserve board has adopted a system using risk based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of certain large bank holding companies 
prior to march   these capital guidelines were applicable to all bank holding companies having million or more in assets on a consolidated basis 
however  effective march   the federal reserve board amended the asset size threshold to million for purposes of determining whether a bank holding company is subject to the capital adequacy guidelines 
eurobancshares currently has consolidated assets in excess of million and is therefore subject to the federal reserve board s capital adequacy guidelines 
under the guidelines  specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of of which at least is required to consist of tier capital elements 
total capital is the sum of tier and tier capital 
to be considered well capitalized  a bank holding company must maintain  on a consolidated basis  i a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and ii a total risk based capital ratio of or greater 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was 
thus  eurobancshares is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the federal reserve board uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the leverage ratio is a company s tier capital divided by its average total consolidated assets 
certain highly rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  but other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
as of december   our leverage ratio was 
the federal banking agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions  substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
imposition of liability for undercapitalized subsidiaries bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels 
in the event an institution becomes undercapitalized  it must submit a capital restoration plan 
the capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institution s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
the aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be adequately capitalized 
the bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan 
for example  a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior federal reserve board approval of proposed dividends  or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates 
acquisitions by bank holding companies the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board before it may acquire all  or substantially all  of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting shares of such bank 
in approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies  the federal reserve board is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned  the convenience and needs of the communities to be served  and various competitive factors 
control acquisitions the change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the federal reserve board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal reserve board  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control 
in addition  any company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act before acquiring in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company or more of the outstanding common stock of the company  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the company 
cross guarantees under the federal deposit insurance act  or fdia  a depository institution which definition includes both banks and savings associations  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic  can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or a receiver and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
in some circumstances depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the fdic  cross guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured depository institutions in a holding company structure 
any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary bank to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary bank s cross guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled insured depository institutions 
eurobank is currently the only fdic insured depository institution subsidiary of eurobancshares 
because eurobancshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from eurobank  its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of eurobank  the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors of eurobank would be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of eurobank to its shareholders  including any depository institution holding company such as eurobancshares or any shareholder or creditor of such holding company 
anti terrorism legislation in the wake of the tragic events of september th  on october   the president signed into law the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of also known as the patriot act  the law enhances the powers of the federal government and law enforcement organizations to combat terrorism  organized crime  and money laundering

proposed regulations interpreting other provisions of the patriot act continue to be issued 
under the authority of the patriot act  the secretary of the treasury adopted rules on september  increasing the cooperation and information sharing among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement authorities regarding individuals  entities and organizations engaged in  or reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in  terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
under those rules  a financial institution is required to expeditiously search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained accounts  or engaged in transactions with individuals or entities  listed in a request submitted by the financial crimes enforcement network fincen  notify fincen if an account or transaction is identified  designate a contact person to receive information requests  limit use of information provided by fincen to i reporting to fincen  ii determining whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction  and iii assisting the financial institution in complying with the bank secrecy act  and maintain adequate procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of fincen requests 
under the new rules  a financial institution may also share information regarding individuals  entities  organizations  and countries for purposes of identifying and  as appropriate  reporting activities that it suspects may involve possible terrorist activity or money laundering 
such information sharing is protected under a safe harbor if the financial institution i notifies fincen of its intention to share information  even when sharing with an affiliated financial institution  ii takes reasonable steps to verify that  prior to sharing  the financial institution or association of financial institutions with which it intends to share information has submitted a notice to fincen  iii limits the use of shared information to identifying and reporting on money laundering or terrorist activities  determining whether to establish or maintain an account or engage in a transaction  or assisting it in complying with the bank security act  and iv maintains adequate procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of the information 
any financial institution complying with these rules will not be deemed to have violated the privacy requirements discussed above 
the secretary of the treasury also adopted a rule on september  intended to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through correspondent accounts maintained by us financial institutions on behalf of foreign banks 
under the rule  financial institutions i are prohibited from providing correspondent accounts to foreign shell banks  ii are required to obtain a certification from foreign banks for which they maintain a correspondent account stating the foreign bank is not a shell bank and that it will not permit a foreign shell bank to have access to the us account  iii must maintain records identifying the owner of the foreign bank for which they may maintain a correspondent account and its agent in the united states designated to accept services of legal process  and iv must terminate correspondent accounts of foreign banks that fail to comply with or fail to contest a lawful request of the secretary of the treasury or the attorney general of the united states  after being notified by the secretary or attorney general

eurobank eurobank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico and the fdic  which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law  and is subject to certain federal reserve board regulations of transactions with its affiliates 
the federal and puerto rico laws and regulations which are applicable to eurobank  regulate  among other things  the scope of its business  its investments  its reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans 
in addition to the impact of such regulations  commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the federal reserve board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy 
transactions with affiliates there are various statutory and regulatory limitations  including those set forth in sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w  governing the extent to which eurobank will be able to purchase assets from or securities of or otherwise finance or transfer funds to eurobancshares or its nonbanking subsidiaries 
among other restrictions  such transfers by eurobank to eurobancshares or any of its nonbanking subsidiaries generally will be limited to of eurobank s capital and surplus and  with respect to eurobancshares and all such nonbanking subsidiaries  to an aggregate of of eurobank s subsidiary s capital and surplus

dividends the ability of eurobank to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by the puerto rico banking act of  as amended  the fdia and fdic regulations 
in general terms  the puerto rico banking act provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than receipts  the excess of expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank and the balance  if any  shall be charged against the required reserve fund of the bank 
if there is no sufficient reserve fund to cover such balance in whole or in part  the outstanding amount shall be charged against the bank s capital account 
the puerto rico banking act provides that until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to of the original capital  the bank may not declare any dividends 
in general terms  the fdia and the fdic regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized  when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments  or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding a bank 
the payment of dividends by eurobank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies  such as maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice that  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement that provides that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of operating earnings for the current and preceding two years 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdic capital requirements eurobank is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain adequate levels of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by applicable regulators 
the fdic and the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico monitor the capital adequacy of eurobank by using a combination of risk based guidelines and leverage ratios 
the agencies consider the bank s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system

total risk based capital is determined by combining core capital and supplementary capital 
under the regulatory capital guidelines  eurobank must maintain a total risk based capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least  a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of at least  and a tier capital to adjusted total assets ratio of at least for banks receiving the highest examination rating to be considered adequately capitalized 
see discussion in the section below captioned the fdic improvement act 
firrea the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  or firrea  includes various provisions that affect or may affect eurobank 
among other matters  firrea generally permits bank holding companies to acquire healthy thrifts as well as failed or failing thrifts 
firrea removed certain cross marketing prohibitions previously applicable to thrift and bank subsidiaries of a common holding company 
furthermore  a multi bank holding company may now be required to indemnify the federal deposit insurance fund against losses it incurs with respect to such company s affiliated banks  which in effect makes a bank holding company s equity investments in healthy bank subsidiaries available to the fdic to assist such company s failing or failed bank subsidiaries 
in addition  pursuant to firrea  any depository institution that has been chartered less than two years  is not in compliance with the minimum capital requirements of its primary federal banking regulator  or is otherwise in a troubled condition must notify its primary federal banking regulator of the proposed addition of any person to the board of directors or the employment of any person as a senior executive officer of the institution at least days before such addition or employment becomes effective 
during such day period  the applicable federal banking regulatory agency may disapprove of the addition of employment of such director or officer 
eurobank is not subject to any such requirements 
firrea also expanded and increased civil and criminal penalties available for use by the appropriate regulatory agency against certain institution affiliated parties primarily including i management  employees and agents of a financial institution  as well as ii independent contractors such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution s affairs and who caused or are likely to cause more than minimum financial loss to or a significant adverse affect on the institution  who knowingly or recklessly violate a law or regulation  breach a fiduciary duty or engage in unsafe or unsound practices 
such practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the submission of inaccurate reports 
furthermore  firrea authorizes the appropriate banking agency to issue cease and desist orders that may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets or take other action as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate 
the fdic improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia  made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions  and improvement of accounting standards 
this statute also limited deposit insurance coverage  implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions 
fdicia requires every bank with total assets in excess of million to have an annual independent audit made of the bank s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the fdic 
fdicia also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending on their level of capital 
fdicia divides banks into five different categories  depending on their level of capital 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more  and the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a certain capital level 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more unless it receives the highest composite rating at its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  in which instance it must maintain a leverage ratio of or more 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than and a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 
in addition  the fdic has the ability to downgrade a bank s classification but not to critically undercapitalized based on other considerations even if the bank meets the capital guidelines 
according to these guidelines  eurobank was classified as well capitalized as of december  in addition  if a state non member bank is classified as undercapitalized  the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the fdic 
pursuant to fdicia  an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets  engaging in a new line of business  acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution  or opening or acquiring a new branch office  except under certain circumstances  including the acceptance by the fdic of a capital restoration plan for the bank 
furthermore  if a state non member bank is classified as undercapitalized  the fdic may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank  if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  the fdic would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions 
these actions would include  among other things  requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital  improvements in management  limits on interest rates paid  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers 
if a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized  fdicia requires the bank to be placed into conservatorship or receivership within ninety days  unless the fdic determines that other action would better achieve the purposes of fdicia regarding prompt corrective action with respect to undercapitalized banks 
the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank 
under fdicia  the fdic is required to conduct a full scope  on site examination of every bank at least once every twelve months 
an exception to this rule is made  however  that provides that banks i with assets of less than million  ii are categorized as well capitalized  iii were found to be well managed and its composite rating was outstanding and iv has not been subject to a change in control during the last twelve months  need only be examined by the fdic once every eighteen months 
broker deposits under fdicia  banks may be restricted in their ability to accept broker deposits  depending on their capital classification 
well capitalized banks are permitted to accept broker deposits  but all banks that are not well capitalized could be restricted to accept such deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept broker deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
deposits obtained from financial intermediaries  so called broker deposits  represented approximately of eurobank s total deposits as of december  as previously mentioned  eurobank is currently well capitalized and therefore is not subject to any limitations with respect to its broker deposits 
federal limitations on activities and investments the equity investments and activities as a principal of fdic insured state chartered banks such as eurobank are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks 
under regulations dealing with equity investments  an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type  or in an amount  that is not permissible for a national bank 
fdic deposit insurance assessments in addition  under fdicia  the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  is authorized to assess insurance premiums on a bank s deposits at a variable rate depending on the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the bank 
under prior law  the deposit insurance assessment was a flat rate  regardless of the likelihood of loss 
in this regard  the fdic has issued regulations that provide for a transitional risk based deposit assessment that determines the deposit insurance assessment rates on the basis of the bank s capital classification and supervisory evaluations 
each of these categories has three subcategories  resulting in nine assessment risk classifications 
the three subcategories with respect to capital are well capitalized  adequately capitalized and less than adequately capitalized which would include undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized banks 
the three subcategories with respect to supervisory concerns are healthy  supervisory concern and substantial supervisory concern 
a bank is deemed healthy if it is financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses 
a bank is deemed subject to supervisory concern if it has weaknesses that  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration of the bank and increased risk to the bank insurance fund  or bif 
a bank is deemed subject to substantial supervisory concern if it poses a substantial probability of loss to the bif 
on june   the deposit insurance funds act of  or difa  was enacted and signed into law as part of the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of difa established the framework for the eventual merger of the bif and the savings association insurance fund  or saif  into a single deposit insurance fund 
it repealed the statutory minimum premium and  under implementing fdic regulations promulgated in  premiums assessed by both the bif and the saif are to be assessed using the matrix described above at a rates between cents and cents per of deposits 
difa also separated  effective january   the financing corporation  or fico  assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the bif and saif assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by the fico would be in addition to the amount  if any  paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
the fico rate could be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in assessment bases for the bif and the saif 
accordingly  eurobank could be subject to two separate premiums for servicing interest on bond obligations and for the bif saif insurance  if such premiums were assessed 
the fdic acts as collection agent for the fico 
in addition  difa authorized the fico to asses both bif and saif insured deposits  and required the bif rate to equal one fifth the saif rate through year end  or until insurance funds were merged  whichever occurred first 
on march   the bif and saif were merged into a newly created deposit insurance fund dif 
in october  as required by the federal deposit insurance reform act of  the fdic issued a final rule to implement the one time deposit insurance assessment credit 
during  the fdic applied an eligible institution s assessment credit less any portion of the credit transferred to another institution against the institution s future assessments to the maximum extent allowed by the statute 
the one time assessment credit could not be used to reduce fico payments 
the one time assessment credit for eurobank  our wholly owned banking subsidiary  amounted to approximately  and was used to reduce the fdic s new insurance premium assessment during  as further explained below 
in november  the fdic adopted a final rule amending its assessment regulations to improve and modernize its operational systems for deposit insurance assessments 
since  the fdic has categorized each insured institution into one of four risk categories following a two step process  which evaluate first the capital ratios of the insured institution and then  other relevant information 
the fdic s new insurance premium rates range between and cents per in accessible deposits 
for the year ended december   total fdic insurance premiums amounted to  net of the one time assessment credit of  as previously explained 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution  including eurobank  if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance  if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of eurobank s deposit insurance 
check clearing for the st century act on october   president bush signed into law the check clearing for the st century act  also known as check the law  which was not effective until october   gave substitute checks  such as a digital image of a check and copies made from that image  the same legal standing as the original paper check 
some of the major provisions include allowing check truncation without making it mandatory  demanding that every financial institution communicate to accountholders in writing a description of its substitute check processing program and their rights under the law  legalizing substitutions for and replacements of paper checks without agreement from consumers  retaining in place the previously mandated electronic collection and return of checks between financial institutions only when individual agreements are in place  requiring that when accountholders request verification  financial institutions produce the original check or a copy that accurately represents the original and demonstrate that the account debit was accurate and valid  and requiring recrediting of funds to an individual s account on the next business day after a consumer proves that the financial institution has erred 
this legislation will likely affect bank capital spending as many financial institutions assess whether technological or operational changes are necessary to stay competitive and take advantage of the new opportunities presented by check community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act  or cra  as implemented by the congress in  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires federal examiners  in connection with the examination of a financial institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
eurobancshares has a compliance committee  which oversees the planning of products  and services offered to the community  especially those aimed to serve low and moderate income communities 
the fdic rated eurobank as satisfactory in meeting community credit needs under the cra at its most recent examination for cra performance 
consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  eurobank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
eurobank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
interstate branching effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may  expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
for purposes of the riegle neal act s amendments to the fdia  eurobank is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act of  eurobank is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in eurobank s home state 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or to which home state determination rules will apply 
eurobank currently does not have any branches outside puerto rico 
federal home loan bank system the fhlb system  of which eurobank is a member  consists of regional fhlbs governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board 
the fhlbs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
they make loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the boards of directors of each regional fhlb 
as a system member  eurobank is entitled to borrow from the fhlb of new york  or fhlb ny  and is required to own capital stock in the fhlb ny in an amount equal to the greater of of the aggregate of the unpaid principal of its home mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each fiscal year  which for this purpose is deemed to be not less than of assets or of the total amount of advances by the fhlb ny to eurobank 
eurobank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules described above with respect to such advances  commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb ny to eurobank are secured by a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb ny held by eurobank 
mortgage banking operations eurobank is subject to the rules and regulations of fha  va  fnma  fhlmc and gnma with respect to originating  processing  selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage backed securities

puerto rico regulation as a commercial bank organized under the laws of puerto rico  eurobank is subject to the supervision  examination and regulation of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico  pursuant to the puerto rico banking act of  as amended 
certain of those activities are described in this supervision and regulation section above 
puerto rico banking law section of the puerto rico banking law requires the prior approval of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico with respect to a transfer of capital stock of a bank that results in a change of control of the bank 
under section  a change of control is presumed to occur if a person or group of persons acting in concert  directly or indirectly  acquires more than of the outstanding voting capital stock of the bank 
the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico has interpreted the restrictions of section as applying to acquisitions of voting securities of entities controlling a bank  such as a bank holding company 
under the puerto rico banking law  the determination of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico whether to approve a change of control filing is final and non appealable 
section of the puerto rico banking law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve which shall not be less than of its demand liabilities  except government deposits federal  state and municipal which are secured by actual collateral 
the reserve is required to be composed of any of the following securities or combination thereof legal tender of the united states  checks on banks or trust companies located in any part of puerto rico  to be presented for collection during the day following that on which they are received  money deposited in other banks or depository institutions  subject to immediate collection  federal funds sold to any federal reserve bank and securities purchased under agreement to resell executed by the bank with such funds that are subject to be repaid to the bank on or before the close of the next business day and any other asset that the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico determines from time to time

as of december   the legal lending limit for eurobank under this provision was approximately million 
if such loans are secured by collateral worth at least more than the amount of the loan  the aggregate maximum amount may reach one third of the sum of eurobank s paid in capital  reserve fund  of retained earnings and any other components that the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico may determine from time to time 
as of december   the legal lending limit for eurobank under this provision was approximately million 
there are no restrictions under section of the puerto rico banking law on the amount of loans which are fully secured by bonds  securities and other evidences of indebtedness of the government of the united states  of the commonwealth of puerto rico  or by bonds  not in default  of authorities  instrumentalities or dependencies of the commonwealth of puerto rico or its municipalities 
section of the puerto rico banking law also prohibits puerto rico commercial banks from making loans secured by their own stock and from purchasing their own stock  unless such purchase is necessary to prevent losses because of a debt previously contracted in good faith 
the stock so purchased by the puerto rico commercial bank must be sold by the bank in a public or private sale within one year from the date of purchase 
section of the puerto rico banking law also requires that at least of the yearly net income of a puerto rico commercial bank be credited to a reserve fund until the amount deposited to the credit of the reserve fund is equal to of total paid in capital common and preferred of the commercial bank

if there is no reserve fund sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part  the outstanding amount shall be charged against the capital account and no dividends shall be declared until said capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to of the original capital of the bank 
section of the puerto rico banking law authorizes eurobank to conduct certain financial and related activities directly or through subsidiaries  including lease financing of personal property  operating small loans companies and mortgage loans activities 
in  eurobank organized an ibe subsidiary  ebs overseas 
puerto rico usury law the rate of interest that eurobank may charge on real estate and other types of loans to individuals in puerto rico is subject to puerto rico s usury law 
that law is administered by the finance board  which consists of the secretaries of the treasury  commerce and consumer affairs departments  the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico  the president of the planning board  the president of the government development bank for puerto rico  the secretary of economic development and commerce department and a representative of the private financial industry 
the finance board promulgates regulations which specify maximum rates on various types of loans to individuals and revises those regulations periodically as general interest rates change 
among the most important regulations enforced on interest rates are regulations  and pursuant to regulation  there is no limitation on interest rates that may be charged on small personal loans 
the same rule applies to retail installment sale contracts and credit card loans as provided by regulation the rates on these loans are established as a result of the market and competition 
interest rates that may be charged on personal loans  personal lines of credit  cash advances on credit cards  commercial loans or commercial lines of credit and residential and commercial mortgage loans are not restricted by regulation the rates on these loans are established as a result of the market and competition

international banking center regulatory act in  we transferred all of the assets and liabilities of eurobank international  an ibe that operated as a division of eurobank  to an ibe subsidiary of eurobank  ebs overseas  inc we also have an ibe that operates as a division of eurobank under the name ebs international bank 
this ibe was acquired under the name of bt international in connection with the acquisition of banktrust and changed to ebs international bank on september  we have continued to operate ebs international as a division of eurobank and do not have immediate plans to transfer its assets to our subsidiary  ebs overseas  inc the business and operations of our ibes are subject to supervision and regulation by the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico 
under the ibe act  no sale  encumbrance  assignment  merger  exchange or transfer of shares  interest or participation in the capital of an ibe may be initiated without the prior approval of the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico  if by such transaction a person would acquire  directly or indirectly  control of or more of any class of stock  interest or participation in the capital of the ibe 
the ibe act and the regulations issued thereunder by the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico limit the business activities that may be carried out by an ibe 
such activities are limited in part to persons and assets located outside of puerto rico 
the ibe act provides further that every ibe must have not less than  of unencumbered assets or acceptable financial guarantees 
pursuant to the ibe act and the ibe regulations  our ibes must maintain books and records of all their transactions in the ordinary course of business 
the ibes are also required to submit to the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico quarterly and annual reports of their financial condition and results of operations  including annual audited financial statements for ebs overseas  inc the ibe act empowers the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico to revoke or suspend  after notice and hearing  a license issued thereunder if  among other things  the ibe fails to comply with the ibe act  the ibe regulations or the terms of its license  or if the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico finds that the business or affairs of the ibe are conducted in a manner that is not consistent with the public interest 
ibes generally are exempt from taxation under united states federal law and puerto rico law 
the legislature of puerto rico and the governor of puerto rico approved a law amending the ibe act 
this law imposes income taxes at normal statutory rates on each ibe that operates as a unit of a bank  if the ibe s net income generated after december  exceeds of the bank s net income in the taxable year commenced on july   of the bank s net income in the taxable year commencing on july   and of the bank s net income in the taxable year commencing on july   and thereafter 
it does not impose income taxation on an ibe that operates as a subsidiary of a bank 
thus  only ebs international bank  which operates as a division of eurobank rather than a subsidiary  is impacted by the new law 
however  we cannot give any assurance that the ibe act will not be modified in the future in a manner to reduce the tax benefits available to ebs overseas 
a reduction of such tax benefits may reduce our earnings 
euroseguros  inc euroseguros is a wholly owned subsidiary of eurobancshares and is registered as a corporate agent and general agency with the office of the commissioner of insurance of the commonwealth of puerto rico 
euroseguros is subject to regulation by the commissioner of insurance relating to  among other things  licensing of employees  sales practices  charging of commissions and obligations to customers 
future legislation and economic policy management of eurobancshares and eurobank cannot predict what other legislation or economic and monetary policies of the various regulatory authorities might be enacted or adopted or what other regulations might be adopted or the effects thereof 
future legislation and policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans  investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid from time and savings deposits 
such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to our business our decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan and lease losses may be inadequate  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
our loan and lease portfolio and investments in marketable securities subject us to credit risk 
inherent risks in lending also include fluctuations in collateral values and economic downturns 
making loans and leases is an essential element of our business  and there is a risk that our loans and leases will not be repaid 
we attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
as of december   our allowance for loan and lease losses totaled million  which represents approximately of our total loans and leases 
there is no precise method of predicting loan and lease losses  and therefore  we always face the risk that charge offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses and that we would need to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan and lease losses 
our methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans is based on classifications of loans and leases into various categories and the application of sfas no 
 as amended 
for non classified loans  the estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences as adjusted for changes in trends and conditions on at least an annual basis 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  the estimated allowance for non classified loans is adjusted for the probable effect that current environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors currently in use 
while our allowance for loan and lease losses is established in different portfolio components  we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
in addition  the fdic as well as the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to establish additional reserves 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in our net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow our assets 
we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers and a significant loss on any one of these credits could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
under applicable law  there are quantitative limitations on the amount of loans we can make to one borrower or a group of related borrowers 
as of december   our legal lending limit was approximately million in the unsecured category  and approximately million in the secured category 
as of december   we had individual borrowers with a loan principal balance of more than million per borrower and another individual borrowers with a loan principal balance of more than million per borrower 
given the size of these current outstanding loans relative to our capital levels and earnings  a significant loss on any one of these credits could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
a significant portion of our leases are secured by automobiles  and the loss of purchasers for our leases or a downturn in automobile purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
a significant portion of our leases are secured by automobiles 
as of december   the total amount of automobile leases was million or of our total leasing portfolio 
we sometimes sell our leases to other financial institutions in order to manage our lease financing concentration 
the loss of purchasers of our leases could cause us to reduce our lease originations  reducing our net income 
alternatively  we may increase the portion of the leases that we retain for our portfolio with the result that our exposure to automobile leases will increase 
in addition  a downturn in automobile purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
we rely heavily on short term funding sources to meet our liquidity needs  such as broker deposits and repurchase obligations  which are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and can be adversely affected by local and general economic conditions 
we have frequently utilized as a source of funds certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers that solicit funds from their customers for deposit with us  or broker deposits 
broker deposits  when compared to retail deposits attracted through a branch network  are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets and could reduce our net interest spread and net interest margin 
in addition  broker deposit funding sources may be more sensitive to significant changes in our financial condition 
as of december   broker deposits amounted to billion  or approximately of our total deposits  compared to broker deposits in the amount of billion and million  or approximately and of our total deposits  for the years and  respectively 
as of december   approximately million in broker deposits  or approximately of our total broker deposits  mature within one year 
our ability to continue to acquire broker deposits is subject to our ability to price these deposits at competitive levels  which may substantially increase our funding costs  and the confidence of the market 
in addition  if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines  we could be restricted in using broker deposits as a short term funding source 
we also have borrowings in the form of repurchase obligations with the federal home loan bank  or the fhlb  and other broker dealers 
these agreements are collateralized by some of our investment securities 
as of december   our repurchase obligations totaled million  of which million  or approximately of the total repurchase obligations  mature within one year 
if we are unable to borrow in the form of repurchase obligations  we may be required to seek higher cost funding sources  which could materially and adversely affect our net interest income 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years  and we may be unable to successfully continue to implement our growth strategy  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
our assets have grown rapidly in recent years 
with the ultimate goal of increasing net income  we have grown our assets from billion as of december  to billion as of december  the types of assets on our balance sheet that have experienced the largest categorical increases are commercial loans and lease financings 
we have funded this growth  in part  with broker deposits  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
these types of funds are generally more costly and volatile than traditional retail deposits 
we may not be able to sustain our current growth rate 
throughout our expansion  we have been successful in attracting new customers  expanding new services to existing customers  adding new business lines  engaging in acquisitions and increasing our deposit base 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue this trend  and it will become more difficult to maintain sustained growth as we increase in size 
our ability to implement our strategy for continued growth depends on our ability to attract and retain customers in a highly competitive market  on the growth of those customers businesses  on entering and expanding in lines of business in which we do not have significant past experience or for which we have only recently added personnel with the requisite experience  on our ability to continue to identify new acquisition targets and on our ability to increase our deposit base 
many of these growth prerequisites may be affected by circumstances that are beyond our control 
our inability to meet any of these growth prerequisites could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
we rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of key officers could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
our success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by our ability to retain the services of existing senior management and  as we expand  to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management 
rafael arrillaga torr ns  jr  our president and chief executive officer  has been instrumental in managing our business affairs 
our other senior executive officers have had  and will continue to have  a significant role in the development and management of our business 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
we have not established a detailed management succession plan 
accordingly  should we lose the services of any of our senior executive officers  our board of directors may have to search outside of eurobancshares for a qualified permanent replacement 
this search may be prolonged and we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate and hire a qualified replacement 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our senior executive officers 
we currently do not have any employment agreements with our senior executive officers  with the exception of a change in control agreement with rafael arrillaga torr ns  jr  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and yadira r 
mercado  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
if any of our senior executive officers leaves his or her respective position  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects may suffer 
the regulatory capital treatment of our junior subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities is uncertain 
financial holding companies with more than million in assets  like us  must maintain minimum capital ratios 
in particular  we must maintain a leverage ratio of tier capital to average assets of  a tier risk based capital ratio of of risk weighted assets  and a total risk based capital ratio tier and tier capital of of risk weighted assets to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
the federal reserve board s current rules regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities allow us to count trust preferred securities as tier capital up to of our total tier capital for regulatory purposes 
the remaining portion counts as tier capital 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted the final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies bhcs 
under the final rule  trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements would be subject to stricter quantitative limits 
the federal reserve board s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to of all core capital elements  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits generally may be included in tier capital 
the final rule provides a five year transition period  ending march   for application of the quantitative limits 
as of december   we had million in trust preferred securities of which all counted as tier capital 
a determination by the federal reserve board not to continue to allow the inclusion of our junior subordinated debentures or the trust preferred securities in tier capital  or otherwise limiting the inclusion of such debentures or securities in tier capital  could have a material and adverse impact on our regulatory capital levels and cause our capital ratios to fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines 
this could impact our ability to grow our assets 
in addition  inadequate regulatory capital levels may result in the imposition of certain operating restrictions on us and eurobank  including restrictions in using broker deposits as a short term funding source 
eurobank entered into a cease and desist order with the fdic regarding its compliance with anti money laundering laws and the bank secrecy act 
on march   the board of directors of eurobank the bank  the wholly owned banking subsidiary of eurobancshares  consented to the issuance of a cease and desist order by the federal deposit insurance corporation based upon the findings of the fdic and the commonwealth of puerto rico office of the commissioner of financial institutions relating to deficiencies in the bank s bank secrecy act anti money laundering compliance program 
under the terms of the fdic order  the bank is required to make specific improvements to its anti money laundering and bsa compliance activities 
while eurobank believes that it will be able to implement effective compliance procedures necessary to remediate the deficiencies identified in the fdic order  in the event that eurobank is unable to satisfy the requirements imposed by the fdic order  eurobank may become subject to monetary fines and penalties as well as additional restrictions on its banking operations  which could affect its ability to execute certain aspects of its business plan 
such measures could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects

the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors  including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors  or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates  conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular  or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry 
in addition  the equity markets have  on occasion  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
in addition  the sale by any of our large stockholders of a significant portion of that stockholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
further  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 
our executive officers and directors own a significant number of shares of our common stock  allowing management significant control over our corporate affairs 
as of december   our executive officers and directors beneficially own of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accordingly  these executive officers and directors will be able to control  to a significant extent  the outcome of all matters required to be submitted to our stockholders for approval  including decisions relating to the election of directors  the determination of our day to day corporate and management policies and other significant corporate transactions

first  we have adopted a stock option plan that provides for the granting of stock options to our directors  executive officers and other employees 
as of december    shares of our common stock were issuable under options granted in connection with our stock option plans 
in addition   shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance to directors  officers and employees under our stock option plan 
it is probable that the stock options will be exercised during their respective terms if the fair market value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the particular option 
if the stock options are exercised  your share ownership will be diluted 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of common stock  but does not provide for preemptive rights to the holders of our common stock 
any authorized but unissued shares are available for issuance by our board of directors 
as a result  if we issue additional shares of common stock to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes  you may be unable to maintain your pro rata ownership in eurobancshares 
future sales of common stock by existing stockholders may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that large sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or limit our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
as of december   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding  which are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws unless purchased or sold by our affiliates within the meaning of rule under the securities act 
holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders 
on december   we issued million of floating rate junior subordinated interest debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by our subsidiary  eurobank statutory trust ii 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in the purpose of this transaction was to raise additional capital to fund our continued growth 
payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of eurobank statutory trust ii are conditionally guaranteed by us 
the junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock 
holders of our series a preferred stock have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 
in connection with our acquisition of banktrust  we issued  shares in the amount of million of our series a preferred stock to certain stockholders of banktrust in exchange for their shares of the series a and series b preferred stock of banktrust 
our series a preferred stock has rights and preferences that could adversely affect holders of our common stock 
for example  we generally are unable to declare and pay dividends on our common stock if there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on our series a preferred stock for the preceding twelve months 
additionally  upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution  or winding up of our business  the holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to receive distributions out of our available assets before any distributions can be made to holders of our common stock 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  or could otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  our bylaws contain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings 
we also have a staggered board of directors  which means that only one third of our board of directors can be replaced by stockholders at any annual meeting 
we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of gains for the foreseeable future 
we have not historically and we currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock 
in addition  since we are a financial holding company with no significant assets other than eurobank  we have no material source of income other than dividends that we receive from eurobank 
therefore  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on eurobank s ability to pay dividends to us 
moreover  banks and bank holding companies are both subject to federal and puerto rico regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends 
we intend to retain the earnings of eurobank to support growth and build equity capital 
accordingly  you should not expect to receive dividends from us in the foreseeable future 
we are also restricted from paying dividends on our common stock if we have deferred payments of the interest on  or an event of default has occurred with respect to  our junior subordinated debentures 
in addition  we generally are unable to declare and pay dividends on our common stock if there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on our series a preferred stock for the preceding months 
your shares are not an insured deposit 
your investment in our common stock will not be a bank deposit and will not be insured or guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency 
your investment will be subject to investment risk  and you must be capable of affording the loss of your entire investment 
risks relating to the economic environment the ongoing economic crisis in puerto rico could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
between may and may   puerto rico experienced a partial government shutdown caused by the inability of the legislature and governor to agree on a budget  which resulted in an estimated million budget shortfall 
this government shutdown forced the closure of approximately public agencies  including puerto rico s public schools  leaving an estimated  government employees out of work 
in response to this economic crisis  several bills were approved by the puerto rico legislature to impose additional taxes  some of which were applicable to the banking industry  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
for more information relating to additional taxes imposed to the banking industry  see the section captioned provision for income taxes in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
in july   the commonwealth of puerto rico enacted legislation authorizing a new sales and use tax of up to 
the new sales and use tax is comprised of a municipal tax  which some municipalities started collecting after the approval of this law  and a central government sales and use tax that became effective as of november  this legislation also abrogated the general excise tax on most imported and manufactured goods 
in addition  the legislation mandates the establishment of measures to limit spending 
these measures include a significant reduction in debt service due to the of sales tax designated for debt service and restructuring of debt transactions  as well as a millionaire reduction in non debt service expenses by planned savings in the health and education areas 
for the fiscal year ended june   the puerto rico planning board registered a contraction of and estimates an additional decline of for fiscal year ending june  certain sectors believe the revenue yield of the sales tax could be lower than previously expected because of tax exemptions included in the law 
also  these sectors believe the government s plan to reduce expenditures heavily depends on debt restructuring and health and education cuts  which could be in an early phase of development 
a period of reduced economic growth or recession  such as this  has had an adverse effect on the quality of our loan and corporate bond portfolios 
during an economic downturn  affected borrowers may  among other things  be less likely to repay interest and principal on their loans or bonds as scheduled 
moreover  the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans and bonds could be adversely affected by an economic downturn 
this would cause the number of foreclosures to increase and  therefore  decrease our ability to recover losses on such properties and assets 
if the economic slowdown persists  those adverse effects may continue and could result in increased delinquency rates in the short term until the economy regains a more sustainable growth 
risks related to united states taxation if we or any of our subsidiaries are determined to be a passive foreign investment company  us holders of our stock could be subject to adverse tax consequences 
if we or any of our subsidiaries are determined to be a passive foreign investment company  known as a pfic  us holders could be subject to adverse united states federal income tax consequences 
specifically  if either we or any of our subsidiaries are determined to be a pfic for any taxable year  each us holder would generally be subject to taxation under special rules  regardless of whether we or any of our subsidiaries remains a pfic  with respect to any excess distribution made by us to the us holders during that taxable year  and any gain realized on the sale  pledge or other disposition during that taxable year of our common stock or the stock of the subsidiary that was determined to be a pfic 
these rules could  in addition to other consequences  cause certain income otherwise classified as capital gain to be taxed at ordinary income rates or the highest rate of tax for ordinary income in the year to which it is allocated regardless of the us holder s particular tax situation and cause the us holder to be subject to an interest charge on the deemed deferred amount at the underpayment rate 
excess distributions generally are any distributions received by the us holder on the common stock in a taxable year that exceed of the average annual distributions received by the us holder in the three preceding taxable years  or the us holder s holding period for the common stock  if shorter 
we believe that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries will be determined to be a pfic in our current taxable year  and we expect to continue to conduct our affairs in a manner so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries qualifies as a pfic in the foreseeable future 
however  we have not requested or received an opinion from our united states tax counsel as to whether we will be determined to be a pfic in our current taxable year and we can give no assurance in this regard

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
executive overview introduction we are a diversified financial holding company headquartered in san juan  puerto rico  offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned banking subsidiary  eurobank  and our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary  euroseguros 
as of december   we had  on a consolidated basis  total assets of billion  net loans and leases of billion  investment securities of million  total deposits of billion  and stockholders equity of million 
we currently operate through a network of branch offices located throughout puerto rico 
over the past three years  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
our management team has implemented a strategy of building our core banking franchise by focusing on commercial loans  business transaction accounts  our mortgage business and acquisitions 
we believe that this strategy will increase recurring revenue streams  enhance profitability  broaden our product and service offerings and continue to build stockholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance and results of operations in our total assets grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of our net loans and leases grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of our investment securities grew to million at the end of  representing an increase of  from million at the end of our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of our nonperforming assets increased to million  or by  in  from million at the end of  our total revenue grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  our net interest margin and spread on a fully taxable equivalent basis was and in  respectively  compared to and in  our provision for loan and lease losses grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  our total noninterest expense grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  and for  we recorded a tax benefit of  compared to an income tax expense of million for these items  as well as other factors  resulted in a net income for of million  compared to million in  or per common share for  compared to per common share for  assuming dilution  and are discussed in further detail throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a description of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loans and allowance for loan and lease losses loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future  or until maturity or payoff  are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted by any charge offs  unearned finance charges  allowance for loan and lease losses  and net deferred nonrefundable fees or costs on origination 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate to provide for probable collection losses in our loan and lease portfolio 
losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance account at the time a loss is incurred or a recovery is received 
the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
losses charged to the allowance amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
recoveries were credited to the allowance in the amounts of million  million and million for those same periods  respectively 
we follow a consistent procedural discipline and account for loan and lease loss contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
to mitigate any difference between estimates and actual results relative to the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  our loan review department is specifically charged with reviewing monthly delinquency reports to determine if additional allowances are necessary 
delinquency reports and analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also provided to senior management and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
the loan review department evaluates significant changes in delinquency with regard to a particular loan portfolio to determine the potential for continuing trends  and loss projections are estimated and adjustments are made to the historical loss factor applied to that portfolio in connection with the calculation of loss allowances 
portfolio performance is also monitored through the monthly calculation of the percentage of non performing loans to the total portfolio outstanding 
a significant change in this percentage may trigger a review of the portfolio and eventually lead to additional allowances 
we also track the ratio of net charge offs to total portfolio outstanding 
our methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans is based on classifications of loans and leases into various categories and the application of sfas no 
for non classified loans  the estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences  which  at least on an annual basis  are adjusted for changes in trends and conditions 
in addition  in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  management also considers the probable effect that current internal and external environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors 
while our allowance for loan and lease losses is established in different portfolio components  we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
with the exception of residential mortgages with a or lower loan to value  and the commercial and construction loans pools  loans that are more than days delinquent result in an additional allowance 
when commercial and construction loans become days delinquent  or earlier if deemed by management  each is subjected to full review by the loan review officer including  but not limited to  a review of financial statements  repayment ability and collateral held 
depending on the review results  our allowance may be increased 
in connection with this review  the loan review officer will determine what economic factors may have led to the change in the client s ability to service the obligation  and this in turn may result in an additional review of a particular sector of the economy 
for additional information relating to how each portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined  see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned allowance for loan and lease losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  however  regulatory agencies  including the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may from time to time require us to reclassify our loans and leases or make additional provisions to our allowance for loan and lease losses 
other real estate owned and repossessed assets other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed assets  normally obtained through foreclosure or other workout situations  are initially recorded at the lower of net realizable value or book value at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
any resulting loss is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
appraisals of other real estate properties are made periodically after their acquisition  as necessary 
valuations of repossessed assets are made periodically after their acquisition 
for oreo and repossessed assets  a comparison between the appraised value and the carrying value is performed 
additional declines in value after acquisition  if any  are charged to current operations 
other real estate owned amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
other repossessed assets amounted to million  million and million for those same periods  respectively 
other repossessed assets are mainly comprised of vehicles from our leasing operation 
for additional information relating to the composition of other repossessed assets  see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned nonperforming loans  leases and assets 
we monitor the total loss ratio on sale of repossessed assets  which is determined by dividing the sum of declines in value  repairs and gain or loss on sale by the book value of repossessed assets sold at the time of repossession 
repossessed vehicles amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the total loss ratio on sale of repossessed vehicles was  and for those same years  respectively 
the increase in our total loss ratio on the sale of repossessed vehicles during was directly attributable to our strategy of being more aggressive in the sale of repossessed vehicles in an attempt to expedite the disposition of slow moving inventory 
this strategy resulted in an increase of approximately in the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory over six months that were sold during  when compared to during  we sold units in inventory over six months  compared to units in inventory over six months sold during the decrease in our total loss ratio on the sale of repossessed vehicles during when compared with was mainly due to the net effect of i an increase in the sale of damaged units previously adjusted for subsequent declines in value  ii the refinements made to our methodology for estimating net realizable value of vehicles upon repossession  and iii our decision to increase the valuation of repossessed vehicles  reducing the book value of the repossessed vehicle in an effort to expedite the disposition of slow moving inventory

changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  in and a decrease of million  or  in the increase in net interest income during resulted from the net effect of an increase in average interest earning assets and increased yields from higher interest rates  and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities and increased cost of funds 
the decrease in net interest income during was primarily due to increased cost of funds 
our net interest margin decreased to for the year ended december   from and for the years ended december  and our net interest spread decreased to in  from in and in these declines in the net interest margin and spread were primarily caused by the increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of the rising short term interest rates and the libor inverted curve  which increased at a faster rate than the yield on earning assets  and to the fact that the increase in average deposits has been comprised substantially of broker deposits  a higher cost category  due to the fierce competitive local environment for core deposits  making broker deposits an attractive funding alternative 
in addition  during  our net interest margin and spread were also affected by decreases in the prime rate  primarily during the fourth quarter of during  our net interest margin and spread were also affected by the write off of  in unamortized placement costs related to the redemption of million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures  as previously mentioned

provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is a direct result of the periodic evaluation of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses  considering the growth in the loan portfolio  net charge offs  delinquencies  related loss experience  current internal and external environmental factors  and overall economic conditions 
we determine a provision for loan and lease losses that we consider sufficient to maintain an allowance to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information concerning this determination  please see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned allowance for loan and lease losses 
our provision for loan and lease losses increased to million in  or of net charge offs  from million in  or of net charge offs  and from million in  or of net charge offs 
the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses during when compared to the previous year was mainly caused by i three business relationships  which became impaired during the third quarter of and required a specific allowance of million  ii the increase in our loan portfolio  and iii the overall economic conditions 
the increase in the provision during when compared to resulted from the growth in our commercial and construction loan portfolio  but primarily from the deterioration of our leasing portfolio 
net charge offs were million in  compared to million in  and to million in for more detail on net charge offs  please refer to the allowance for loan and lease losses section herein 
we believe existing allowance levels are appropriate 
while our allowance for loan and lease losses is established in different portfolio components  we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
because we do not have any major industry concentrations  the determination of our provision for loan and lease losses is not impacted by such industry concentrations

our largest noninterest income source is service charges  primarily on deposit accounts  representing  and of total noninterest income in  and  respectively 
this income source for amounted to million  compared to million in and million in the increase in was mainly due to an increase in non sufficient fund charges on deposit accounts  atm merchant fees  trust fees  other fees on loan accounts  leasing license commissions  and an increase in miscellaneous income mainly related to our credit card operations 
the decrease in was mainly due to a decrease in trust fees and non sufficient fund charges on deposit accounts 
another component of noninterest income for is the net loss on sale of non hedging derivatives 
during year ended december   net noninterest income reflected a  net loss on non hedging derivatives on which hedge accounting had been discontinued 
the net loss during reflected a million charge to earnings in the first quarter of for net losses on non hedging derivatives on which hedge accounting had been discontinued and a  gain on the termination of such derivatives in the second quarter of the derivatives were assumed in connection with the acquisition of banktrust in may during  gain on sale of loans and leases amounted to  compared to  in and to  in income from gain on sale of loans and leases as a percentage of total noninterest income was  and in  and  respectively 
this source of noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of mortgage loans and lease financing contracts 
during  we sold million in mortgage loans to other financial institutions  compared to million in and million in in addition  during the third quarter  we sold  in individual residential construction loans to other financial institution 
we did not retain the servicing rights on these loans and we accounted for this transaction as a sale  resulting in a gain of approximately   and  for those same periods 
in june  we became a government national mortgage association issuer 
in order to take advantage of this designation  we are increasing our volume of mortgage loans originations and have restructured the mortgage loans department to increase our sales in the secondary market

during  we recognized a million loss on sale of million in fhlb and mortgage backed securities  compared to a  loss on sale of million in us treasury obligations available for sale in these investments were sold in an effort to improve the yields of the available for sale securities portfolio 
there was no sale of investments in our final component of net noninterest income is the net gain or loss on the sale of other real estate owned  repossessed assets and other assets 
during  we experienced a net loss in this component of million  compared to a net gain of  in  and net losses of million for the year ended december  the net loss on sale of other real estate owned  repossessed assets and other assets during was directly attributable to our strategy of being more aggressive in the sale of repossessed vehicles to expedite their disposition and avoid the build up of our repossessed vehicles inventory  primary during the first and second quarter of this strategy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory 
during five quarters in a row  sales of repossessed vehicles exceeded the number of units repossessed 
the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory as of december  decreased to units  or by approximately  from units as of december   after increasing by from units as of december  this is the lowest level of repossessed vehicles in inventory since august during  the decrease in the net loss on sale of other real estate owned  repossessed assets and other assets was in part due to the sale of a real estate property during the second quarter of  which resulted in a gain of approximately  but primarily to the refinements we made to our methodology for estimating the net realizable value of vehicles upon repossession and to our decision of increasing the valuation allowance of repossessed vehicles in an effort to expedite the disposition of slow moving inventory  as previously mentioned 
we continue monitoring the repossessed vehicles inventory very closely and taking measures to expedite its disposition

noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets increased to in  from in and in our efficiency ratio was in  in and in the efficiency ratio is determined by dividing total noninterest expense by an amount equal to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis plus noninterest income 
we anticipate that the overall volume of our noninterest expense will continue to increase as we grow 
however  we remain committed to controlling costs and efficiency and expect to moderate these increases relative to our revenue growth 
salaries and employee benefit expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was mainly attributable to an increase of approximately million in salary adjustments and expanded personnel for business growth  after considering a decrease of million in costs deferred upon a reduction in leasing originations  a  increase related to the opening of four branches during  and an increase of approximately  related to employees benefits  mainly related to an increase in the medical plan expense

professional and directors fees were million  million and million  or  and of total noninterest expenses  in  and  respectively

our expenses related to oreo and repossessed assets remained at million  or and of total interest expense in and  respectively  compared to million  or of total noninterest expense in the increase in these expenses during was attributable primarily to the combined effect of an increase in the average number of repossessed vehicles in inventory  which resulted in increased repairs and maintenance expenses  and an increase in the valuation allowance of repossessed vehicles in an effort to expedite their disposition in the future 
during  the average number of repossessed vehicles in inventory increased by to units  when compared to vehicles for promotion and advertising increased to million in  from million and  in and  respectively

during  the decrease in other non interest expenses was mainly associated with the provision for losses on off balance sheet items and insurance claim receivables 
provision for income taxes puerto rico income tax law does not provide for the filing of a consolidated tax return  therefore  the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated income statement is the sum of our income tax expense and the income tax expenses of our individual subsidiaries 
our revenues are generally not subject to us federal income tax 
income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying our current tax rate to taxable income 
the deferred tax expense benefit reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to an income tax expense of million in  and million in our income tax provision for year ended december   and was comprised of a current income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  and a deferred tax benefit of million and  for and  respectively  compared to a deferred tax expense of million in our current income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million in  after increasing from million in during  the decrease in our current income tax expense was mainly due to the net effect of i a reduction in our income before taxes  ii an increase in the net exempt income during  iii the total consumption during the quarter ended march  of net operating losses nols from acquired financial institutions  and iv the termination on december  of the additional transitory taxes of imposed by the puerto rico legislature in the increase in our current income tax expense during was mainly due to the total consumption of nols from acquired institutions  which was substantially lesser than the amount consumed in our deferred tax benefit for the year ended december  increased to million  from a deferred tax benefit of  in  compared to a deferred tax expense of million in during  the increase in the deferred tax benefit was mainly due an increase in deferred tax assets mainly due to an increase in our provision for loan and lease losses as of december   primarily during the third quarter of the change in the deferred tax provision during was mainly due to the combined effect of i a substantially lesser amount of nols from acquired institutions consumed during when compared to  and ii a decrease in deferred loan and leases net origination costs 
as of december   and we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this assessment  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  our compliance with the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and tax planning strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of these deductible differences at december  will be realized 
on december   the governor of puerto rico approved and signed law no 
 which offers tax credits to financial institutions on the financing of qualified residential mortgages 
these tax credits vary based on whether the property to be financed is an existing dwelling or a new construction and whether it will be occupied by the buyer or is acquired for investment purposes 
the tax credits are limited  subject to certain restrictions  to a maximum of a of the property s selling price  or  whichever is lower 
this law expires on june  or when the tax credits granted reach the total allotted amount of million  whichever occurs first 
the tax credit will become available to us for the taxable years beginning after december  up to taxable year ended december  and it will not impact our net income tax provision

the company could use the payment in equal portions as a tax credit in the income tax return for the taxable years beginning after december  no income tax expense was recorded in related to this law since such prepayment was to be used as a tax credit in the income tax return of taxable years beginning after december  on may   the governor of puerto rico approved and signed law no 
 which imposed an additional transitory tax of on taxable income 
this tax was applicable to the banking industry raising the maximum statutory tax rate to for taxable years beginning after december  and ending on or before december  this law also stated that for taxable years beginning after december   the maximum statutory tax rate will be 
on august   the governor of puerto rico approved and signed law no 
 which imposed an additional transitory tax of on taxable income 
this additional tax increased the maximum statutory tax rate from to and is applicable to all corporations and partnerships with taxable income in excess of  during the taxable years beginning after december  and ending on or before december  the approval of the additional transitory taxes of over the original maximum statutory tax rate of as mentioned above  resulted in additional income tax expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
financial condition our total assets as of december  were billion  compared to billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in our total assets during was primarily the net result of a decrease in securities purchased under agreements to resell  an increase in our investment securities portfolio  the organic growth of our loan portfolio  and an increase in premises and equipment 
during  the increase was primarily the net result of organic growth in our loan portfolio and a decrease in our investment portfolio 
our total deposits increased by to billion in  after increasing by to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the increase in deposits during and was concentrated in broker deposits  as further explained below 
other borrowings increased to million in  after decreasing to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase in broker deposits and other borrowings during was mainly attributable to the fierce competition for core deposits on the island due to a reduction of local funding sources 
this fierce competition for local deposits has made broker deposits and other borrowings an attractive funding alternative  resulting in lower funding costs when compared to the unusually higher rates offered locally for time deposits 
we decided to pursue the use of the broker deposits and other borrowings alternative in an attempt to control the continuous increase in our funding cost 
in  the decrease in other borrowings was mainly related to a decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and the redemption of trust preferred securities  as previously mentioned 
stockholders equity increased by to million as of december   representing an increase of million from million as of december  as of december   our stockholders equity was million  representing an increase of from million as of december  besides earnings and losses from operations  stock options exercised  a private placement  and stock repurchases  our stockholders equity was also impacted by accumulated an other comprehensive gain of million during and other comprehensive losses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively

our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs 
our investment portfolio mainly consists of securities classified as available for sale and a small portion of securities we intend to hold until maturity  or held to maturity securities

as part of this positioning  in the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately million of fhlb and mortgage backed securities available for sale with an average yield of since we expected an improvement in the yield curve during during  we continued analyzing different market opportunities in an attempt to improve the investment portfolio s average yield and to maintain an adequate average life 
during the second half of  the market presented some good investment opportunities as a result of the liquidity crises faced by some banks and brokers in the mainland  which made them sell part of their investment securities portfolios at wider spreads to reduce their total assets 
we were able to acquire securities that improved our average yield and extended the average maturity of the portfolio

our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines promulgated by the fdic in the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  review of appraised value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
on occasions  the bank grants real estate secured loans for which the loan to values exceed 
in those instances  additional forms of collateral or guaranties are obtained 
loans secured by real estate  excluding construction loans  equaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the volume of our real estate loans has increased significantly as a result of our organic growth 
real estate secured loans  excluding real estate secured construction loans  as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to in  from in  and from in loans secured by real estate included residential mortgages amounting to million as of december   which increased by million  or by  when compared to million as of december   after increasing by from million as of december  these increases in residential mortgages mainly resulted from our strategy of expanding our residential mortgage operations to take advantage of opportunities in this area on the island  as previously mentioned 
lease financing contracts  the second largest component of our loan portfolio  consist of automobile and equipment leases made to individuals and corporate customers 
we continue emphasizing on automobile leasing 
for  approximately of our lease financing contracts originations were for new automobiles  approximately were for used automobiles and the remaining consisted primarily of construction and medical equipment leases 
the volume of our lease financing contracts decreased to million as of december   from million and million as of december  and  respectively 
lease financing contracts  as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and at the end of  and  respectively 
the decrease in our lease portfolio during and resulted from the proactive actions we started taking during the third quarter of to tightening our underwriting standards  enhance our collections efforts and strategically pare back our automobile leasing operations upon the deterioration of our lease portfolio  mainly during the last quarter of during september and march  we sold lease financing contracts on a limited recourse basis to a third party with carrying values of million and million  respectively 
we did not sell lease financing contracts during and other commercial and industrial loans include revolving lines of credit as well as term business loans  which are primarily collateralized by accounts receivable and the assets being acquired  such as equipment or inventory  and other forms of collaterals or guaranties 
other commercial and industrial loans increased to million as of december   from million in and million in the increase in other commercial and industrial loans in and was due to our organic growth 
other commercial and industrial loans as a percentage of total loans were   and at the end of  and  respectively 
construction loans secured by real estate totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
construction loans secured by real estate as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and for those same periods  respectively 
during and  the increase in construction loans secured by real estate resulted from of our organic growth  which was primarily comprised of loans for the construction of residential multi family projects that  although private  are moderately priced or of the affordable type supported by government assisted programs  and other loans for land development and the construction of commercial real estate property 
consumer loans have historically represented a small part of our total loan and lease portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans consist of personal installment loans  credit cards  boat loans  and consumer lines of credit 
we make consumer loans only to complement our commercial business  and these loans are not emphasized by our branch managers 
as a result  repayment on this portfolio has generally exceeded or equaled origination  except for  when we acquired consumer loans in connection with our acquisition of former banktrust 
consumer loans as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and at the end of  and  respectively 
consumer loans as of december   and included a boat portfolio of million  million and million  respectively  million  million and million  respectively  in unsecured installment loans  and credit cards and open end loans for million  million and million  respectively 
our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans generally have maturities of three to five years  while we generally limit commercial loans secured by real estate maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
leases are offered for terms up to months 
the following table shows our maturity distribution of loans and leases  including loans held for sale of million  as of december   excluding non accrual loans amounting to million as of the same date 
a significant part of our non consumer loan portfolio is floating rate loans which comprise both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans 
by contrast  residential mortgage loans originated by eurobank are fixed rate 
residential mortgage loans are included in the real estate secured category in the following table 
as of december  over year through years over years one year or less fixed rate floating or adjustable rate fixed rate floating or adjustable rate total in thousands real estate construction real estate secured other commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total maturities are based upon contract dates 
demand loans are included in the one year or less category and totaled million as of december nonperforming loans  leases and assets nonperforming assets consist of loans and leases on nonaccrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans that have been restructured resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  oreo  and other repossessed assets 
the following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming assets net of the portion guaranteed by the united states government as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans and leases  net of unearned nonperforming assets to total loans and leases  net of unearned  plus repossessed property nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans we continually review present and estimated future performance of the loans and leases within our portfolio and risk rate such loans in accordance with a risk rating system 
more specifically  we attempt to reduce the exposure to risks through reviewing each loan request and renewal individually  utilizing a centralized approval system for all unsecured loans and secured loans over individual managers limit  strictly adhering to written loan policies  and conducting an independent credit review 
in general  we receive and review financial statements of borrowing customers on an ongoing basis during the term of the relationship and respond to any deterioration noted 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and we are in the process of collection 
for loans placed in nonaccrual status  the nonrecognition of interest income on an accrual basis does not constitute forgiveness of the interest  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status  resulting in an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and when we believe the borrower will eventually overcome financial difficulties and repay the loan in full 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans and leases that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on a cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual status 
nonperforming assets consist of loans days or more past due still accruing interest  loans and leases on non accrual status  oreo  and other repossessed assets 
non performing assets increased to million as of december   from million and million as of december  and  respectively 
nonperforming assets to total assets increased to as of december   from and as of december  and  respectively 
non performing loans are comprised of loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  and loans and leases on nonaccrual status 
the nonperforming loans increased to million as of december   from million as of december   after increasing by million from million as of december   as further explained below 
nonperforming loans to total loans increased to as of december   from and as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in nonperforming loans during was mainly due to combined effect of a million increase in loans days or more past due still accruing interest and an increase of million nonaccrual loans 
during  the increase in loans days or more past due still accruing interest was mainly due to the combined effect of a million increase in loans secured by real estate  a  increase in other commercial and industrial loans  a  increase in lease financing contracts  and a  increase in overdraft 
our historical losses on commercial and construction loans secured by real estate have been low 
the million increase in loans secured by real estate was mainly caused by two commercial business relationships of which one was in the construction industry amounting to million and the other was in the dairy business amounting to million  which was partially secured by real estate  and also had milk production quotas among other assets serving as collateral 
the million increase in nonaccrual loans during was mainly due to the net effect of a million increase in loans secured by real estate  a million increase related to one construction business relationship  which was partially secured by real estate and also had other corporate guaranties  a  decrease in lease financing contracts  and a  decrease in marine loans 
the million increase loans secured by real estate was mainly caused by i six commercial business relationships amounting to million secured by real estate of which two amounting to million were in the communication and service industries  respectively  three were in the commercial trade and or construction industries amounting to million  and another was in the elective health services industry amounting to million  ii five commercial business relationships amounting to million partially secured by real estate  of which two were in the dairy farm business amounting to million and had milk production quotas servicing as collateral  and the other three were in the food retailing  security systems  and service industry  and iii other two in the general freight and health care industries  respectively  amounting to million not secured by real estate 
the increase in nonperforming loans during was mainly due to the combined effect of a million increase in loans days or more past due still accruing interest and an increase of million in nonaccrual loans 
during  the increase in loans or more days still accruing interest was mainly concentrated in one business relationship secured by real estate for million 
the increase in nonaccrual loans during was mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase of million in commercial and construction loans  and an increase of  in marine loans 
the million increase in nonaccrual commercial and construction loans included five business relationships secured by real estate amounting to million  and other three loans amounting to million granted to a construction company  for which real estate collateral was held for approximately of the total debt and proceeds from specific assignments of construction contracts were sufficient to repay the remaining balance 
as of december   all nonperforming loans mentioned above remained in nonaccrual status 
we believe all loans and leases  with which we have serious doubts as to collectibility  are classified within the category of nonperforming loans and leases and are appropriately reserved 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and that management intends to offer for sale 
other repossessed assets are comprised of repossessed automobiles  boats and equipment subject to lease contracts 
oreo and repossessed assets are initially recorded at the lower of net realizable value or book value 
any resulting loss is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
an appraisal of oreo and valuations of repossessed assets are made periodically after a property is acquired  and a comparison between the appraised value and the carrying value is performed 
additional declines in value after acquisition  if any  are charged to current operations 
gains or losses on disposition of oreo and repossessed assets  and related operating income and maintenance expenses  are included in current operations 
as of december   our oreo consisted of properties with an aggregate value of million  compared to properties with an aggregate value of million as of december   and properties with an aggregate value of million as of december  during  we repossessed properties with an aggregate value of million  of which eighteen were land lots in the amount of million belonging to one commercial customer  and sold properties with an aggregate value of  during  we repossessed properties with an aggregate value of million and sold properties with an aggregate value of million 
other repossessed assets as of december  were million  compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   and  other repossessed assets were comprised of repossessed vehicles amounting to million  million and million  respectively  repossessed boats amounting to  million and million  respectively  and repossessed equipment amounting to   and  respectively 
during  the decrease in repossessed assets was mainly due to the net effect of a decrease of million in repossessed vehicles  a decrease of  in repossessed boats  and an increase of  in repossessed equipment 
the decrease in repossessed vehicles during was mainly attributable to our strategy of being more aggressive in the sale of repossessed vehicles  primary during the first and second quarter of as previously mentioned  this strategy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory 
this is the fifth quarter in a row in which the number of repossessed vehicles sold exceeded the number of units repossessed 
the number of repossessed vehicles in inventory as of december  decreased to units  or by approximately  from units as of december   after increasing by  from units as of december  total repossessed and sold vehicles during were  and  respectively  compared to  and  in  and to  and  in during  the increase in repossessed assets was mainly due to the net effect of an increase of million in repossessed vehicles  and a decrease of  and  in repossessed boats and equipment  respectively 
the increase in repossessed assets during was mainly due to the deterioration of our lease portfolio 
however  even though the number of repossessed vehicles in increased when compared to  the net increase during  in term of units  was lower as sales of repossessed assets also increased for as compared to  as previously mentioned 
we continue monitoring the inventory of repossessed vehicles very closely and taking measures to expedite its disposition 
the ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases plus repossessed property oreo and other repossessed assets increased to as of december   from and as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for loan and lease losses we have established an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loans and leases in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  monthly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  as discussed below  and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments 
when analyzing the adequacy of our allowance  our portfolio is segmented into major loan categories 
although the evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance focuses on loans and leases and pools of similar loans and leases  no part of our allowance is segregated for  or allocated to  any particular asset or group of assets 
our allowance is available to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as classification  type of loan or lease  industry or collateral 
as needed  we separately analyze the following components of our portfolio and provide for them in our allowance credit quality  sufficiency of credit and collateral documentation  proper lien perfection  appropriate approval by the loan officer and the loan committees  adherence to any loan agreement covenants  and compliance with internal policies and procedures and laws and regulations 
the general portion of our allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to all categories of loans and leases outstanding in our portfolio 
we use historic loss rates determined over a period of to years  which  at least on an annual basis  are adjusted to reflect any current conditions that are expected to result in loss recognition 
the resulting loss factors are then multiplied against the current period s balance of loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
rates for each pool are based on those factors management believes are applicable to that pool 
when applied to a pool of loans or leases  the adjusted historical loss rate is a measure of the total inherent losses in the portfolio that would have been estimated if each individual loan or lease had been reviewed 
in addition  another component is used in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
this additional component serves as a management tool to measure the probable effect that current internal and external environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors currently in use 
factors that we consider include  but are not limited to effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures  including those for underwriting  collection  charge offs  and recoveries  changes in the experience  ability and depth of our lending management and staff  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  levels of  and trends in  delinquencies and nonaccruals  and national and local economic business trends and conditions 
on a quarterly basis  a risk percentage is assigned to each environmental factor based on our judgment of the implied risk over each loan category 
the result of our assumptions is then applied to the current period s balance of loans outstanding to derive the probable effect these current internal and external environmental factors could have over the general portion of our allowance 
the net allowance resulting from this procedure is included as an additional component in the evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance 
in addition to our general portfolio allowances  specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate a high probability that a loss will be incurred 
this amount is determined following a consistent procedural discipline in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
through periodic management review at branch and executive level and utilization of internal delinquency processes  both portfolios and individual loans and leases are monitored on an ongoing basis 
when considered appropriate  a specific allowance will be considered on individual loan or lease accounts 
a review is generally conducted of all the conditions surrounding any particular account such as the borrower s character  existing and potential financial condition  realizable value of collateral  prospects for additional collateral and payment record 
as a result  the loss potential is determined and specific allowances may be established  which will vary depending on the analysis 
as mentioned above  our methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans is based on classifications of loans and leases into various categories and the application of sfas no 
 as amended 
as explained before  for non classified loans  the estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences as adjusted for changes in trends and conditions on at least an annual basis 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  the estimated allowance for non classified loans is adjusted for the probable effect that current environmental factors could have on the historical loss factors currently in use 
while our allowance for loan and lease losses is established in different portfolio components  we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
although our management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the table below summarizes  for the periods indicated  loan and lease balances at the end of each period  the daily average balances during the period  changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses arising from loans and leases charged off  recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off  and additions to the allowance  and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan and lease losses year ended december  dollars in thousands average total loans and leases outstanding during period total loans and leases outstanding at end of period  including loans held for sale allowance for loan and lease losses allowance at beginning of period charge offs real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total charge offs recoveries real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total recoveries net loan and lease charge offs provision for loan and lease losses allowance of acquired bank banktrust allowance at end of period ratios net loan and lease charge offs to average total loans allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to provision for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses increased by  or million  to million as of december   after increasing by  or  to million in  from million in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to at the end of year  from in  and in the allowance for loan and lease losses is affected by net charge offs  loan portfolio growth  and also by the provision for loan and lease losses for each related period  which  during  was certainly impacted by the overall economic conditions 
the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses during was mainly caused by three business relationships  which became impaired during the third quarter of and required a specific allowance of million  as previously mentioned 
during  the increase in the allowance for loans and lease losses was mainly related the loss trends in our leasing portfolio  as explained further below  and the growth in our loan portfolio 
the loan portfolio growth during and was mostly concentrated in commercial loans secured by real estate  on which the loss of risk is lesser than in the other loan categories 
we consider that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
on a quarterly basis  we have the practice of effecting partial charge offs on all lease finance contracts that are over days past due 
this is done based on our historical lease loss experience during the previous calendar year 
accordingly  all lease finance contracts that are over days past due at the end of each quarter are partially charged off 
for each of the years ended december   and  we used a historical loss ratio in lease finance contracts of approximately  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million was charged off for this purpose  respectively 
also  except for leases in a payment plan  bankruptcy or other legal proceedings  we have the practice of charging off most of our lease finance contracts that were over days past due 
this full charge off is made on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  most of our lease finance contracts that are over days past due at the end of each quarter are fully charged off 
for the years ended december   and  approximately   and million was charged off for this purpose  respectively 
we monitor the ratio of net charge offs on the leasing business to the average balance of our leasing portfolio 
the net charge off ratio on the leasing business was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the net charge off ratio on the leases business during was mainly due to the decrease in our lease portfolio 
however  for  the amount of net charge offs in our leasing portfolio remained stable when compared to the year ended december  during  the increase in the net charge off ratio on the leases business was mainly due to the combined effect of portfolio deterioration and a decrease in our lease portfolio 
our lease portfolio decreased to million as of december   from million as of december  and from million at the end of fiscal year net charge offs in our leasing portfolio remaining at million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   after increasing from million for the year ended december  we have been closely monitoring the lease portfolio and have tightened underwriting standards in an attempt to reduce possible future losses  as previously mentioned 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was  and for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in this ratio during was mainly attributable to the decrease in our inventory of repossessed vehicles  as previously mentioned 
during  the increase in this ratio was mainly due to an increase in net charge offs from our leasing portfolio  as further explained below 
net charge offs as a percentage of provision for loan and lease losses decreased to as of december   from in  and from in the decrease in this ratio during was mainly attributable to the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses to account for i the specific allowance required by three commercial business relationships  which became impaired during the third quarter of  as previously mentioned  and ii a deterioration in the overall economic conditions  as previously mentioned 
during  the decrease in this ratio was mainly a result of the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses to account for the loss trends in our leasing portfolio 
net charge offs were million for the year ended december   compared to million in  and million in the change in net charge offs for the year ended december   when compared to year ended december   resulted from i a  decrease in net charge offs from loans secured by real estate  ii  increase in net charge offs from other commercial and industrial loans  iii  decrease in net charge offs from consumer loans  iv a  decrease in net charge offs from our leasing portfolio  and v a  increase in net charge offs from overdrafts 
the increase in net charge offs for the year ended december   when compared to year ended december   resulted mainly from i a million increase in net charge offs from our leasing portfolio  ii a million decrease in net charge offs from other commercial and industrial loans  iii a  decrease in net charge offs from consumer loans  and iv a  increase in net charge offs from real estate secured loans 
the increase in net charge offs from our leasing portfolio was mainly attributable to the increase in the volume of repossessed assets  as explained before  and also to an increase in the initial market valuation of repossessed vehicles at the time of repossession  reducing the book value of repossessed vehicles 
net charge offs as a percentage of our year end portfolio balance  or net loss experience  has averaged for our commercial loan portfolio that is not secured by real estate over the past five years 
as previously mentioned  our historical losses through the years from our commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate have been low 
however  because a significant portion of our business is focused on commercial lending  we have generally maintained a conservative allowance for our commercial loan portfolio 
for the portion of our commercial loan portfolio adequately secured with real estate collateral  we maintain an allowance equal to of the outstanding balance of such portfolio 
the allowance for commercial loans that are not secured by real estate is equal to of the outstanding portfolio balance 
our consumer loan portfolio  excluding boat financing  has averaged a net loss experience over the past five years 
this is partially attributable to the fact that  in connection with our acquisitions of other banks  additional charge offs have been recorded and additional allowances have been built into the transaction pricing to compensate for future losses 
for our consumer loan portfolio  excluding boat financing  we maintain an allowance equal to of the outstanding balance of such portfolio 
our five year old construction loan portfolio has no loss experience 
nevertheless  we maintain an allowance for this portfolio equal to of the portfolio balance 
our leasing portfolio has a net loss experience over the last year 
we maintain an allowance equal to of the balance of this portfolio 
our boat financing portfolio has a net loss experience over the past four years 
we maintain an allowance equal to of the balance of this portfolio 
although our mortgage portfolio has no loss experience  we maintain an allowance equal to of this portfolio 
the table below presents an allocation for the allowance for loan and lease losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans and leases in each category to gross loans or leases

nonearning assets premises  leasehold improvements and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  totaled million as of december   compared to million and million at the end of year and  respectively 
the increase in nonearning assets during was primarily attributable to the purchase of land and an office building to serve as our new headquarters  as explained further below 
on february   eurobank  our wholly owned banking subsidiary  closed on the purchase of land and an office building to serve as our new headquarters 
the property  which is located in san juan  includes a  square foot office building that consolidates our headquarters  administrative operations  and our leasing division 
the purchase price for the property was  by december  we had completed moving our headquarters  our leasing division  and almost all administrative departments to the new building 
as of december   office building improvements amounted to million 
we anticipate that there may be a benefit from certain efficiencies associated with centralizing these operations in one location 
in addition  as of december   eurobank had three land lots amounting to million  of which one lot valued at  was purchased in april for future branch development  and the other two had an aggregate value of  and were purchased in december for future expansion of our headquarters 
except for aforementioned acquisition  we have no definitive agreements regarding acquisition or disposition of owned or leased facilities and  for the near term future  we do not expect significant changes in our total occupancy expense 
deposits deposits are our primary source of funds 
average deposits for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
average deposits grew by million  or by  in  and by million  or  in the increase in average deposits for and was mainly concentrated in broker deposits

the decrease in now and money market accounts  savings accounts  and other time deposits in denominations of less than  was mainly due to the fierce competition for core deposits on the island due to a reduction of local funding sources 
this fierce competition for local deposits has made broker deposits an attractive alternative  resulting in lower funding costs when compared to the usually higher rates offered locally for time deposits 
also  as previously mentioned  we decided to pursue the use of broker deposits alternative in an attempt to control the continuous increase in our funding cost 
because broker deposits are generally more volatile and interest rate sensitive than other sources of funds  management closely monitors growth in this category 
the following table sets forth the amount and maturities of the time deposits of  or more as of the dates indicated  excluding individual retirement accounts as of december  in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through months over months total other sources of funds securities sold under agreements to repurchase to support our asset base  we sell securities subject to obligations to repurchase to securities dealers and the fhlb

capital resources and capital adequacy requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier capital includes common stockholders equity  our series a preferred stock  our junior subordinated debentures subject to certain limitations  less goodwill 
total capital represents tier plus the allowance for loan and lease losses subject to certain limits 
in the past three years  our primary source of capital have been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
as of december   and  total stockholders equity was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the following items also impacted our stockholders equity during  a total of  stock options were exercised for the aggregate exercise price of million  as follows  on february  at an aggregate exercise price of million  and  stock options on july  at an aggregate exercise price of between the second and third quarter of  we repurchased  shares for million in connection with a stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may  which was completed in september in an effort to improve our net interest margin  on december   we redeemed million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures bearing an interest rate of at the time of redemption  upon which eurobank statutory trust i  one of our non banking subsidiaries  redeemed million in trust preferred securities 
up to december   we included these trust preferred securities as part of our tier capital 
we believe that remaining supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities from eurobank statutory trust ii will allow us to achieve and maintain our status as a well capitalized institution and to sustain our continued loan growth 
for more detail on notes payable to statutory trusts please refer to note notes payable to statutory trusts to our consolidated financial statements 
during  a total of  options were exercised for the aggregate exercise price of  as follows  options on september  at an aggregate exercise price of   options on june  at an aggregate exercise price of  and  options on february  at an aggregate exercise price of  during and  we repurchased  shares for million and  shares for million  respectively  upon a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october  respectively  which expired in october on november    we recorded  for  shares as treasury stock as a result of a payment in lieu of foreclosure from a former borrower 
we are not aware of any material trends that could materially affect our capital resources other than those described in the section entitled risk factors  in this annual report on form k 
as of december   we and eurobank both qualified as well capitalized institutions under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
however  if our capital ratios fall below the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines  we could be restricted in using broker deposits as a short term funding source 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to our capital ratios for eurobank as of the dates specified actual for minimum capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provision amount is ratio is amount must be ratio must be amount must be ratio must be dollars in thousands as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank tier capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank leverage to average assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank tier capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank leverage to average assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank tier capital to risk weighted assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank leverage to average assets eurobancshares  inc n a eurobank liquidity management maintenance of adequate core liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all times to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose the bank chose to maintain a minimum target liquidity referred as core basis surplus and defined as the portion of the bank s funds maintained in short term investments and other marketable assets  less the liabilities portions secured by any of these assets to cover a portion of time deposits maturing in days and a portion of the non maturity deposits  expressed as a percentage of total assets 
this core basis surplus number generally should be positive  but it may vary as our asset and liability committee decides to maintain relatively large or small liquidity coverage  depending on its estimates of the general business climate  its expectations regarding the future course of interest rates in the near term  and the bank s current financial position 
two additional factors that will impact the magnitude of the core basic surplus target are the available borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank fhlb  as represented by qualifying loans on the balance sheet  and unused brokered time deposits capacity relative to the bank s related policy limit on acceptable levels of these deposits 
for this reason  current fhlb advances and broker time deposits availability are part of the bank s liquidity presentation 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our core basis surplus liquidity level was  and as of the same periods  respectively 
as of december   our core basic surplus was impacted by an increase in interest bearing deposits and short term investments in connection with the approximately million in fhlb and fnma debt securities we sold during that month 
the funds generated through this sale of securities were used to finance a portion of the loans origination during the decrease in our core basic surplus liquidity level indicated above was mainly attributable to the reduction in interest bearing deposits and short term investments previously mentioned  and that the growth in the investment portfolio was funded mostly with repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowings reducing the portion of unpledged securities to total assets compared to december  as mentioned above  in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize fhlb advances and broker and out of market certificates of deposit to meet our liquidity needs 
other funding alternatives are borrowing lines with brokers and the federal reserve bank of new york  and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by qualified residential and commercial mortgage loans  and investment securities 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
as of december   we had fhlb borrowing capacity of million  including fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
also  as of the same date  we had million in pre approved repurchase agreements with major brokers and banks  subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities available for sale 
in addition  eurobank is able to borrow up to million from the federal reserve bank using securities currently pledge as collateral 
eurobank also maintains pre approved overnight borrowing lines with correspondent banks  which provided additional short term borrowing capacity of million at december  in order to participate in the broker time deposits market  we must be categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action unless we obtain a waiver from the federal deposit insurance corporation 
restrictions on our ability to participate in this market could place limitations on our growth strategy or could result in our participation in other more expensive funding sources 
in case of restrictions  our expansion strategies would have to be reviewed to reflect the possible limitation to funding sources and changes in cost structures 
as of december   we and eurobank both qualified as well capitalized institutions under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
our minimum target core basis surplus liquidity ratio established in our asset liability management policy is 
our liquidity demands are not seasonal and all trends have been stable over the last three years 
we are not aware of any trends or demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially impair our liquidity 
generally  financial institutions determine their target liquidity ratios internally  based on the composition of their liquidity assets and their ability to participate in different funding markets that can provide the required liquidity 
in addition  the local market has unique characteristics  which make it very difficult to compare our liquidity needs and sources to the liquidity needs and sources of our peers in the rest of the nation 
after careful analysis of the diversity of liquidity sources available to us  our asset quality and the historic stability of our core deposits  we have determined that our target liquidity ratio is adequate 
our net cash inflows from operating activities for were million  compared to cash inflows of million and million from operating activities for the year and  respectively 
the net operating cash inflows during and resulted primarily from the net effect of i proceeds from sale of loans held for sale  ii an increase in accrued interest receivable  iii an increase in accrued interest payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and iv a net increase in other assets 
during  the net operating cash inflows resulted primarily from the net effect of i proceeds from sale of loans held for sale  ii an increase in accrued interest receivable  iii an increase in accrued interest payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and iv a net decrease in other assets 
our net cash outflows from investing activities for the years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the net investing cash outflows experienced in were primarily used for the growth in our investment and loan portfolios 
during  the net investing cash outflows experienced were primarily used for the growth in our loan portfolio 
the higher net investing cash outflows experienced in were primarily due to growth in the investment securities portfolio  which provided additional collateral in that year to support wholesale funding increases and a growth in our loan and lease portfolio 
our net cash inflows from financing activities for the years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the net financing cash inflows experienced in were primarily provided by a net increase in deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other borrowing 
during and  the net financing cash inflows were primarily provided by a net increase in deposits 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessary move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by eurobank s board of directors and carried out by eurobank s asset liability management committee 
the asset liability management committee s objectives are to manage our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding  investment security purchase and sale strategies and mortgage loan sales  as well as derivative financial instruments 
eurobank may enter into interest rate swap agreements  in which it exchanges the periodic payments  based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates 
also  eurobank may use contracts to transform the interest rate characteristics of specifically identified assets or liabilities to which the contract is tied 
at december   the bank had interest rate swap agreements which converted million of fixed rate time deposits to variable rate time deposits of which million will mature in and and million with maturity between and but with semi annual call options which match call options on the swaps 
in addition  as of december   eurobank had million related to an option and equity based return derivative  which was purchased in january to fix the interest rate expense on a million certificate of deposit 
for more detail on derivative financial instruments please refer to note derivative financial instruments to our condensed consolidated financial statements included herein 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  using the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of the bank s existing assets and liabilities  including off balance sheet financial instruments 
net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing and relationship between various interest rates 
at december   we modeled rising ramp and declining interest rate simulations in basis point increments over two years 
the impact of embedded options in such products as callable and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans and callable borrowings were considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
the asset liability management committee utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes and to understand the level of risk volatility given a range of reasonable and plausible interest rate scenarios 
in this context  the core interest rate risk analysis examines the balance sheet under rates up down scenarios that are neither too modest nor too extreme 
all rate changes are ramped over a month horizon based upon a parallel yield curve shift and maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon 
using this approach  we are able to obtain results that illustrate the effect that both a gradual change of rates year and a rate shock year and beyond has on margin expectations 
in the december  simulation  our model indicated no material exposure in the level of net interest income to gradual rising rates ramped for the first month period  and no exposure in the level of net interest income to a rate shock of rising rates for the second month period 
this is caused by the effect of the volume of our commercial and industrial loans variable rate portfolio and the maturity distribution of the repurchase agreements and broker deposits  our primary funding source  from days to approximately years 
the hypothetical rate scenarios consider a change of and basis points during two years 
the decreasing rate scenarios have a floor of basis points 
at december   the net interest income at risk for year one in the basis point falling rate scenario was calculated at   or lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and million  or lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point decrease 
the net interest income at risk for year two in the basis point falling rate scenario was calculated at million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point decrease 
at december   the net interest income at risk for year one in the basis point rising rate scenario was calculated to be  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and  or higher than the net interest income in the rate unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point increase 
the net interest income at risk for year two in the basis point rising rate scenario was calculated at million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and million  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point increase 
these exposures are well within our policy guidelines of and for and basis points changes in rate scenarios  respectively 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit run offs and pricing and reinvestment strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios as of december  change in future net interest income gradual raising rate scenario year at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year change in future net interest income rate shock scenario year at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year basis points over year we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table represents our on and off balance sheet aggregate contractual obligations  other than deposit liabilities  to make future payments to third parties as of the date specified as of december  less than one year over one year to three years over three years to five years over five years in thousands fhlb advances notes payable to statutory trusts operating leases total in addition  on february   eurobank  our wholly owned banking subsidiary  closed on the purchase of land and an office building to serve as our new headquarters 
the purchase price for the property was off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which have a term of less than one year  represent a credit risk and are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and million  respectively 
these commitments included standby letters of credit of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  and commercial letters of credit of million   and million for those same periods  respectively 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot reasonably be predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used
