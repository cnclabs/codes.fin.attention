item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we securely deliver the enterprise network to users  wherever they work or roam  with user centric networks that expand the reach of traditional port centric networks 
user centric networks integrate adaptive wireless local area networks wlans  application continuity services  and identity based security into a cohesive  high performance system that can be deployed as an overlay to existing enterprise networks 
adaptive wlans deliver high performance  follow me connectivity so users are always connected 
application continuity services enable follow me applications that can be seamlessly accessed across wlans and cellular networks 
identity based security associates access policies with users  not ports  to enable follow me security that is enforced regardless of access method or location 
the products we license and sell include the arubaos operating system  optional value added software modules  a centralized mobility management system  high performance programmable mobility controllers  wired and wireless access points  wireless intrusion detection tools  spectrum analyzers  and endpoint compliance solutions 
our products have been sold to over  end customers worldwide not including customers from alcatel lucent  including some of the largest and most complex global organizations 
we have now implemented a two tier distribution model in most areas of the world  including the us  with value added distributors vads providing our portfolio of products  including a variety of our support services  to a diverse number of value added resellers vars 
our focus continues to be management of our channel eco system including selection and growth of high prospect partners  activation of our resellers through active training and field collaboration  
table of contents evolution of our channel programs in consultation with our partners  and deriving full value from our vads in the leverage they can provide 
our ability to increase our product revenues will depend significantly on continued growth in the market for enterprise mobility solutions  continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  our ability to continue to attract new customers  our ability to compete against more established companies as well as privately held competitors  and our ability to continue to sell into our installed base of existing customers 
our growth in support revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product and channel mix  average selling prices  costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our ability to attain profitability will also be affected by our ability to effectively implement and generate incremental business from our distribution model  most notably from our two tier distribution model  and by the extent to which we invest in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative resources to grow our business  and general economic conditions 
on march   we completed our acquisition of airwave wireless  inc airwave for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million which included  shares of our common stock  valued at million  and approximately million in cash 
airwave designs and sells specialized software to centrally manage large  multi vendor wireless local area networks lan  mesh  and wimax networks 
revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses revenues we derive our revenues from sales of our arubaos operating system  controllers  wired and wireless access points  application software modules  multi vendor management solution software  and professional services and support 
professional services revenues consist of consulting and training services 
consulting services primarily consist of installation support services 
training services are instructor led courses on the use of our products 
support revenues typically consist of software updates  on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
we only began recognizing product revenues upon delivery using the residual method for transactions in which all other revenue recognition criteria are met  in the three months ended january  as we have not been able to establish vendor specific objective evidence vsoe on our prior services and support offerings  all transactions prior to the three months ended january  continue to be recognized ratably over the support period 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
our revenue growth has been driven primarily by an expansion of our customer base coupled with increased purchases from existing customers 
we believe the market for our products has grown due to the increased demand of business enterprises to provide secure mobility to their users 
recently we have experienced longer sales cycles in certain vertical markets and seasonality in our second fiscal quarter  both of which have slowed our revenue growth 
each quarter  our ability to meet our product revenue expectations is dependent upon new orders received  shipped  and recognized in a given quarter  the amount of orders booked but not shipped in the prior quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue entering a given quarter 
our product deferred revenue is comprised of revenue associated with product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the agreement contain acceptance language or other terms that require that the revenue be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met  as well as those customer contracts that we entered into prior to our establishment of vsoe of fair value 
we typically ship products within a reasonable time period after the receipt of an order and our ability to meet our forecasted product revenue is dependent on our ability to convert our sales pipeline into product revenues from orders received and shipped within the fiscal quarter 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through vads  vars  distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems 
we expect revenues from indirect channels to continue to constitute a substantial majority of our future revenues 

table of contents we sell our products to channel partners and end customers located in the americas  europe  the middle east  africa and asia pacific 
shipments to our channel partners that are located in the united states are classified as us revenue regardless of the location of the end customer 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenues to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
for more information about our international revenues  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we began to sell our products to alcatel lucent  one of our oems  which  in turn  sells our products under its own brand name 
alcatel lucent accounted for  and of our revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues consists primarily of manufacturing costs for our products  shipping and logistics costs  and expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations 
we utilize third parties to manufacture our products and perform shipping logistics 
we have outsourced the substantial majority of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations 
accordingly  the substantial majority of our cost of revenues consists of payments to flextronics  our contract manufacturer 
flextronics manufactures our products in china and singapore using quality assurance programs and standards that we jointly established 
manufacturing  engineering and documentation controls are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and bangalore  india 
cost of product revenues also includes amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
cost of professional services and support revenues is primarily comprised of the personnel costs of providing technical support  including personnel costs associated with our internal support organization 
in addition  we employ a third party support vendor to complement our internal support resources  the costs of which are included within costs of professional services and support revenues 
gross margin our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the proportion of our products that are sold through direct versus indirect channels  new product introductions and enhancements both by us and by our competitors  product mix and average selling prices  demand for our products and services  our ability to attain volume manufacturing pricing from flextronics and our component suppliers  losses associated with excess and obsolete inventory  growth in our headcount and other related costs incurred in our customer support organization  and amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
due to higher discounts given to the indirect channel  our overall gross margins for indirect channel sales are typically lower than those associated with direct sales 
we expect product revenues from our indirect channel to continue to constitute a substantial majority of our total revenues  which  by itself  negatively impacts our gross margins 
however  in prior quarters we have experienced a favorable change in our product mix as we sold more higher margin products  which contributed to improved overall gross margins 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  overall gross margins decreased as we sold more access points than in prior quarters  which generally have a lower gross margin 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  
table of contents benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation for all employees 
we grew from approximately employees at july  to approximately employees at july   including approximately employees from our airwave acquisition 
we expect to continue to strategically hire employees throughout the company as well as invest in research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and facilities costs 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe it is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales personnel worldwide with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive  and thus  the increase in sales and marketing expenses that we experience as we hire additional sales personnel is not expected to immediately result in increased revenues and reduces our operating margins until such sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  as well as insurance  investor relations  and it infrastructure costs related to our new erp system 
further  our general and administrative expenses include professional services consisting of outside legal  audit  sarbanes oxley and information technology consulting costs 
we expect that we will incur significant additional legal costs related to defending ourselves against claims made by outside parties 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal stock based compensation effective august   we began measuring and recognizing expense for all stock based payments at fair value  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation for fiscal years   and  respectively 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income on cash balances  accretion of discount or amortization of premium on short term investments  interest expense  and losses or gains on conversion of non us dollar transactions into non us dollars 
cash has historically been invested in money market funds and marketable securities 
prior to fiscal  other income expense  net also included adjustments to record our outstanding preferred stock warrants to fair value 
subsequent to our initial public offering ipo in march  we are no longer required to remeasure these warrants to fair value 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from two sources product revenue  including hardware and software products  and related professional services and support revenue 
support typically includes software updates  on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide our customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenues for support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically between one year and five years 
we account for revenues in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related amendments and interpretations sop because our products are integrated with software that is essential to their functionality and because we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to the equipment through support agreements 
typically  our sales involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include support  training and or consulting services 
when a sale involves multiple elements  we allocate the entire fee from the arrangement to each respective element based on its vsoe of fair value and recognize revenue when each element s revenue recognition criteria are met 
vsoe of fair value for each element is established based on the sales price we charge when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element of an agreement  when the undelivered element is support  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the support is delivered 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we had not been able to establish vsoe of fair value in accordance with sop at the outset of our arrangements 
accordingly  prior to the second quarter of  we recognized revenue for the entire transaction ratably over the support period  as the only undelivered element was typically support 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we were able to establish vsoe of fair value at the outset of our arrangements as we established a new support and services pricing policy  with different services and support offerings than were previously sold 
we also began selling support services separately from our arrangements in the form of support renewals 
accordingly  beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing product revenues upon delivery using the residual method  for transactions where all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
as we had not been able to establish vsoe on our prior services and support offerings  all transactions prior to the second quarter of fiscal continue to be recognized ratably over the support period 
we recognize revenue only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
additionally  we recognize revenue from indirect sales channels upon persuasive evidence provided by our indirect channel customers of a sale to the end customer 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
stock based compensation effective august   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense beginning august  for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated term of each award 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a 
table of contents straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
this model also utilizes the fair value of our common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the stock based award  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield of our common stock to determine the estimated fair value 
we determine the amount of stock based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
compensation expense includes awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for awards granted subsequent to july  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in addition  compensation expense includes the effects of awards modified  repurchased or cancelled since the adoption of sfas r 
for purposes of sfas r  employee stock based compensation related to both unvested awards granted prior to august  and awards granted on or after august  are being amortized on a straight line basis  which is consistent with the methodology used historically for pro forma purposes under sfas we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from non employees in accordance with the consensus reached by the eitf in issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
costs are measured at the fair market value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earlier of the date on which there first exists a firm commitment for performance by the provider of goods or services or on the date performance is complete 
goodwill and intangibles we apply sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of impairment testing  we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the company 
the estimates of fair value of the company are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily includes our market capitalization 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from two to seven years 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to estimated results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
determination of recoverability of purchased intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 

table of contents inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using the standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory write downs for potentially excess inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends and technological obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
inventory write downs amounted to million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  our management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  including trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  especially given the recent financial crisis in today s economic environment 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at july  and  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  along with net operating loss carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences  research and credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards are deductible 
to the extent deferred tax assets cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance is established 
based on the available objective evidence  including the fact that we have generated losses since inception  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  management has applied a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
effective august   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
this interpretation requires us to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not record any changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior periods  and no corresponding change in accumulated deficit 
additionally  we did not make any reclassifications between current taxes payable and long term taxes payable upon adoption of fin see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion regarding the adoption of fin recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us

table of contents revenues years ended july  in thousands total revenues type of revenues product professional services and support ratable product and related professional services and support total revenues revenues by geography united states europe  the middle east and africa asia pacific rest of world including japan total revenues prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized revenue from sales of our products ratably over the term of the support contract with each customer  which is typically one to five years 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  when we were able to establish vsoe of fair value  we began recognizing revenue upon shipment of our products  for transactions where all other criteria for revenue recognition were satisfied 
professional services and support revenues primarily represent support contracts and are recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one to five years 
because of the change in the timing of our revenue recognition in the second quarter of fiscal  comparisons of the absolute dollar growth in our revenues on a year over year basis are not meaningful 
for fiscal  total revenues increased over fiscal due to an increase of million in product and professional services and support revenues 
the increases in revenue were due to the continual and steady growth of the wlan market and the significant growth in our customer base during fiscal the introduction of our new n access points also contributed to the increase in our product revenues 
further  we saw continued growth in the education and healthcare verticals during fiscal we believe the customers in these verticals continue to show increased demand for advanced wireless and lan technology 
the decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the run off in the amortization of deferred revenue associated with those customer contracts that we entered into prior to our establishment of vsoe of fair value 
we expect ratable product and related professional services and support revenues to continue to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 
in fiscal  we derived of our product revenues from indirect channels  which consist of vads  vars  and oems  compared to in fiscal we expect to continue to derive a substantial majority of our product revenues from indirect channels as we focus on improving the ability of our indirect channel partners to more effectively market and sell our products 
revenues from shipments to locations outside the united states increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in demand for our products as the wlan market expanded internationally 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal which was consistent with fiscal we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenues to increase in absolute dollars and to increase as a percentage of total revenues in future periods 

table of contents substantially all of our customers purchase support when they purchase our products 
the increase in professional services and support revenues is a result of increased first year support sales combined with the renewal of support contracts by existing customers 
as our customer base grows  we expect the proportion of our revenues represented by support revenues to increase 
total revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in product revenue as a result of the growth of the wlan market 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenue 
we generated of our revenues in fiscal from shipments to locations outside of the us compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our emea region as we expanded our operations and sales and marketing efforts in emea 
revenue from our indirect channels was of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal as we began to build out our distribution channel 
cost of revenues and gross margin years ended july  in thousands total revenues cost of product cost of professional services and support cost of ratable product and related professional services and support total cost of revenues gross profit gross margin in fiscal  cost of revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to a corresponding increase in our product revenues 
the substantial majority of our cost of product revenues consists of payments to flextronics  our contract manufacturer 
payments to flextronics and flextronics related costs constituted more than of our cost of product revenues for fiscal   and cost of professional services and support revenues in fiscal increased compared to fiscal however  the costs did not increase at the same rate as the increase in professional services and support revenues due to cost efficiencies in our support organization 
during fiscal  cost of professional services and support increased million compared to fiscal primarily as a result of several significant professional services transactions for large installations of our products that we entered into in the first quarter of fiscal amortization expense of our purchased technology intangible assets also increased million in fiscal  compared to fiscal cost of ratable product and related professional services and support decreased during this period consistent with the decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenues 
as we expand internationally  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we plan to continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 
gross margins increased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in our revenues  which grew at a higher rate than the associated costs 
for the first three quarters of fiscal  gross margins increased primarily as a result of a favorable change in our product mix as we continued to sell more higher margin products  as well as the high growth rate and percentage of revenue derived from our support business 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold more access points than in prior quarters  which generally contribute a lower gross margin 
in fiscal cost of revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the corresponding increase in our revenues 
more specifically  product revenues increased during this period which resulted in an 
table of contents increase in cost of product revenues  primarily relating to payments to flextronics 
cost of professional services and support revenues increased during this period as professional services and support revenues doubled and we added more technical support headcount domestically and abroad to support our growing customer base 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in cost of ratable product and related professional services and support revenues during this period consistent with the decrease in ratable product and related professional services and support revenues 
gross margins improved for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in our revenues  which grew at a higher rate than the associated costs 
this was primarily as a result of a favorable change to our product mix as we sold more higher margin products  as well as the high growth rate and percentage of revenue derived from our support business 
research and development expenses years ended july  in thousands research and development expenses percent of total revenues in fiscal  research and development expenses increased  compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase of million in personnel and related costs  including an increase of million in stock based compensation 
these increases were due to an increase in our headcount of employees 
we continue to hire more employees in research and development in order to develop additional functionality for existing products and develop new products in an effort to remain competitive 
outside services for engineering also increased by million as a result of hiring several outside agencies to perform compliance reviews on our n access points 
facilities expenses increased million as a result of leasing a new building for our sunnyvale  ca headquarters  as well as facilities related expenses of airwave 
depreciation expense also increased million due to an increase in depreciable assets 
in fiscal  research and development expenses increased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in headcount 
personnel and related expenses increased million  including an increase of million in stock based compensation 
the cost of internal equipment increased million due to the use of certain of our product inventory for research and development purposes 
depreciation expense also increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses years ended july  in thousands sales and marketing expenses percent of total revenues in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased over fiscal  due to an increase of million in personnel and related costs  including an increase of million in stock based compensation 
these increases were due to an increase in our headcount in sales and marketing of employees to support our growing business 
demonstration equipment expenses increased million also due to the increase in headcount as each new sales representative is provided demonstration equipment 
facilities expenses increased million as a result of leasing a new building for our sunnyvale  ca headquarters  as well as facilities related expenses of airwave 
amortization of purchased customer and tradename intangible assets increased million due to the acquisition of network chemistry and airwave 
expenses associated with marketing programs increased million and depreciation expense increased million 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased over fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in headcount 
personnel and related expenses increased million including million of stock based compensation 
we also increased our marketing programs in fiscal by million primarily for lead generation and demonstration tools 
recruiting expenses increased million as we grew our sales and marketing 
table of contents workforce in order to generate new business 
as a result of the new employees in sales and marketing  facilities expenses increased million 
general and administrative expenses years ended july  in thousands general and administrative expenses percent of total revenues in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased over fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in headcount 
consequently  personnel expenses increased million 
this increase in other personnel expenses was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a one time charge of million in stock based compensation expense as a result of issuing stock to a charitable foundation 
facilities expenses increased million as a result of leasing a new building for our sunnyvale  ca headquarters  as well as facilities related expenses of airwave 
professional fees associated with legal and audit services increased million primarily due to litigation  sarbanes oxley compliance consulting and additional costs associated with being a public company 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase of million in personnel and related costs as a result of increased headcount  including an increase of million in stock based compensation 
accounting and legal expenses increased million primarily due to becoming a public company 
in process research and development expense in process research and development expense related to our acquisition of network chemistry s line of rfprotect and bluescanner wireless security products on july  and consisted of feature enhancements and functional improvements to the underlying technology 
a total of  was expensed upon the consummation of the acquisition in fiscal because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
this development project was intended to add new functionalities necessary to address evolving customer needs  and drive market acceptance of the acquired products 
the acquired in process technology was at a stage of development that required further research and development to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability 
because the in process research and development was not yet complete and not yet generating revenue and profits  there was risk that the developments would not be completed and or not competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionalities 
during fiscal  we completed the in process research and development projects  the results of which were consistent with our expectations 
acquisition related severance expenses in connection with the acquisition of airwave  we terminated one of airwave s executives due to redundancy 
as a result  we recorded expenses totaling approximately  for severance and related benefit costs 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense  expense for warrants issued in connection with equipment loans  and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
years ended july  in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense  net 
table of contents interest income increased in fiscal from fiscal as a result of interest income earned on our short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance as of july  was million compared to million as of july  however million of the balance as of july   was received as a result of our ipo in march thus  the interest earned in fiscal was lower than fiscal because the investments were held for a shorter period of time 
during fiscal  we adjusted the carrying value of our preferred stock warrants to their fair value each period resulting in warrant expense 
subsequent to the ipo and the associated conversion of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock  the warrants to purchase shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase an equivalent number of shares of our common stock  and the warrants were no longer subject to remeasurement 
these fair value adjustments account for the remaining change in other income expense  net 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we determined that the fair values assigned to certain warrants to purchase preferred stock issued to non employees were not computed correctly as of the ipo closing date when they automatically converted to warrants to purchase common stock  which resulted in  of excess warrant expense being recognized in other income expense  net in the third quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we corrected the valuation of these warrants resulting in the inclusion of other income of  within other income expense  net and a reduction of additional paid in capital of  management and our audit committee concluded that the error was not material to the third quarter of fiscal  the year ended july  or the estimated results for the year ending july   and therefore  the correction was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal this increase in other income expense  net was offset by foreign currency losses of  for fiscal which was primarily driven by the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into us dollars 
total other income expense  net increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase of million in warrant expense 
the increase in expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income of million due to the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses  and  accordingly  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than state and foreign provisions for income tax 
as of july   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
we also had research and credit carryforwards of million for federal and million for state income tax purposes as of july  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire between and utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we have experienced an ownership change in the past  or if an ownership change occurs in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective august   we adopted fin this interpretation requires us to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not record any changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior periods  and no corresponding change in accumulated deficit 
additionally  we did not make any reclassifications between current taxes payable and long term taxes payable upon adoption of fin

as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
with the exception of the second quarter of fiscal  our revenues have increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented due to increases in the number of products sold to new and existing customers and international expansion 
these increases were offset by the quarterly decrease in the amortization of deferred revenue associated with those customer contracts that we entered into prior to establishment of vsoe of fair value 
with the exception of the second quarter of fiscal  operating expenses in all quarters increased sequentially as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate the growing business on a quarterly basis 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fsp  which subjects warrants to the requirements in statement  regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or the redemption price and requires us to classify the warrants on our preferred stock as liabilities and adjust our warrant instruments to fair value at each reporting period 
we recorded expense of  million  and million in other income expense  net in the quarters ended october   january  and april   respectively  to reflect the increase in fair value of the warrants 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a gain of  due to excess warrant expense being recognized in other income expense  net in the third quarter of fiscal subsequent to the ipo and the associated conversion of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock  the warrants to purchase shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase an equivalent number of shares of our common stock and the related carrying value of such warrants was reclassified to additional paid in capital  and the warrants are no longer subject to remeasurement 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of july  in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments years ended july  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities since our inception in february through our ipo in march  we funded our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of redeemable convertible preferred stock  which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of million 
in march  we completed our ipo which provided us with approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
most of our sales contracts are denominated in united states dollars  and as such  the increase in our revenues derived from international customers has not affected our cash flows from operations 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
to date  the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has been immaterial 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our working capital requirements and the extent to which we increase spending on personnel as our business grows 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and cash flows from sales personnel 
to a lesser extent  the start up costs associated with international expansion have also negatively affected our cash flows from operations 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  purchases of inventory  and rent payments 
during fiscal  operating activities provided million of cash compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the increase is due to increases in accounts payable  deferred revenue  and other current and non current liabilities  as well as non cash items such as stock based compensation and depreciation 
cash provided by operating activities was offset by our net loss  and increases in accounts receivable  inventory  and non cash items such as interest accretion on our short term investments 
cash used in operating activities decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in non cash activities  such as stock based compensation and the increase in fair value of our warrants  and increases in other current and non current liabilities  deferred revenue and accounts receivable  offset by decreases in deferred costs and accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal largely due to a significant decrease in our net purchases of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities included cash paid for the acquisition of airwave 
we also purchased property and equipment of million related to the continual build out of our infrastructure to support our growth 

table of contents in fiscal  cash used in investing activities increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the purchase of short term investments 
cash used in investing activities also increased as a result of our purchase of a business from network chemistry  inc cash flows from financing activities in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our stock plan  equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan 
cash flows from financing activities were offset in part by the million repurchase of common stock under our structured repurchase program 
in march  we completed our ipo which provided us with approximately million in net proceeds 
we also obtained million in net proceeds from the issuance of our redeemable convertible preferred stock during fiscal based on our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we expect that we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we have no current agreements  commitments  plans  proposals or arrangements  written or otherwise  with respect to any material acquisitions 
we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
other uses of cash on february   we announced a stock repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
during the fiscal year ended july   we repurchased  shares under this program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
purchases may be made in the open market  not to exceed million per quarter  and will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the price of our common stock  general business and market conditions  and other investment considerations 
to the extent that we repurchase shares under this authorization  interest income may decrease as our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decrease 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of july  more than total years in thousands operating leases non cancellable inventory purchase commitments other purchase commitments total contractual obligations we outsource the production of our hardware to third party manufacturing suppliers 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with these suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date  and of orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at july  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk most of our sales contracts are denominated in united states dollars  and therefore  our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro and japanese yen 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant to date  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million at july  and  respectively 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in fiscal  our interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would have declined approximately million assuming consistent investment levels
