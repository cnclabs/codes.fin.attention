item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided in order to gain an understanding of the company s financial performance during the periods presented 
the discussion includes forward looking statements and  with respect to this section  the cautionary language applicable to such forward looking statements described above in a caution about forward looking statements found before item of this form k is incorporated by reference into this item forward looking statements are management s best estimates and actual results could differ substantially from those estimates 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
executive summary and overview the company provides services and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
tidewater inc is one of the most internationally diverse companies in the offshore energy industry with five decades of international experience 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet that is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices that  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
for a second consecutive year the company exceeded the billion revenue mark due to strong industry fundamentals  primarily in the company s international markets 
the company recorded billion in revenues during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over its fiscal revenues 
fiscal consolidated net earnings dipped a modest  or million  as compared to fiscal  however  included in fiscal consolidated earnings was an after tax gain of million  related to the sale of of its offshore tugs 
after removing the after tax gain on the sale of the tugs  the company realized an approximate increase in consolidated net earnings during fiscal compared to fiscal the company s international operations continue to be the primary driver of its earnings and  during fiscal  revenues generated from international operations as a percentage of the company s total revenues were  and reflected a growth in revenues from the prior year 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for crude oil 
during fiscal  international based revenues and operating profit increased approximately million and million  or and  respectively  as compared to fiscal due to strong worldwide demand for oil and gas and an improved operating environment which resulted in vessel day rate escalations 
higher fiscal international based vessel revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs and depreciation expense 
fiscal international based operating costs increased approximately from fiscal levels due primarily to higher crewing costs  repair and maintenance costs  insurance and loss reserves and other type vessel costs  much of which can be attributed to new vessels added to the fleet during the last two fiscal years 
consistent with public reports  demand for vessels in the shallow water gulf of mexico offshore vessel market has diminished as repair work has been completed on the offshore energy infrastructure that was damaged by hurricane ivan in and hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september  respectively  and numerous drilling rigs have relocated to international areas 
the number of drilling rigs in the us market should continue to be the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the us market and  at present  the offshore rig count in the gulf of mexico remains at very low levels as compared to past industry up cycles 
the strength of the international drilling market has attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
over the longer term  the company s us based fleet should be affected more by the active offshore rig count in the united states than by any other single outside influence 
the company s united states results of operations are primarily dependent on the demand and supply relationship for natural gas 
the company s us based revenues and operating profit decreased approximately million and million  or and  respectively  during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower average day rates and utilization on all vessel classes operating in the us market 
the company s us based results of operations were also lower due to the sale of the company s us based offshore tugs in fiscal  as previously disclosed

index to financial statements key focus for fiscal and outlook during fiscal  the company continued its focus on growing its international markets  maintaining its competitive advantage and modernizing its vessel fleet in order to generate future earnings capacity 
the company is effectively utilizing its strong cash position to grow the industry s largest fleet of new vessels and also fund common stock repurchases when appropriate 
in the company s operating business  management focused on improving dayrates and utilization and maintaining disciplined cost control 
given the progress the company has made in executing its strategies  the company is poised to continue to grow organically through the construction of vessels at a variety of shipyards worldwide and  given the right opportunity  to grow through targeted and disciplined acquisitions that provide shareholder value 
the company has the largest number of older vessels among its competitors in the industry  and it also has the largest fleet of new vessels in the industry 
because the company has a large number of older vessels  management has also targeted assessing opportunities for its older fleet in its strategic initiatives 
the company will continue to pursue its long term growth strategies on a disciplined basis and  in each case  will carefully consider whether proposed transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
these areas of opportunity have a common theme  which is to leverage the company s existing strengths and capitalize on favorable market conditions to improve operating profit  earnings per share and cash flows 
the company s safety performance was disappointing during fiscal while the company s total recordable incident rate trir was the second best in the company s history  at per  man hours  the company experienced eight lost time accidents during the fiscal year  including six fatalities 
the company s principal operations occur in offshore waters where the workplace environment is unstable 
because the environment is unstable  the company works diligently to maintain workplace safety 
management regularly communicates with its personnel to promote safety and instill safe work habits through company media and safety review sessions 
the company also regularly conducts safety training meetings for its seamen and staff personnel 
the company is committed to improving its record for the safety of the company s employees and for the safety of its customers

the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc  is constructing the two foot vessels 
one international shipyard is constructing the six foot vessels while two different international shipyards are constructing the eight foot vessels 
the six foot vessels are scheduled for delivery beginning in december with final delivery of the sixth vessel in january expected delivery for the eight foot vessels  which are considered deepwater class vessels  will begin in january with delivery of the eighth foot vessel in september the eight foot vessels  which are considered deepwater class vessels  are being constructed at an international shipyard  and are expected to be delivered to the market beginning in november with final delivery of the eighth foot vessel in july as of march   million has been expended on these vessels 
the company is also committed to the construction of two foot  fast  crew supply boats and two water jet crewboats for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
two separate international shipyards are constructing these vessels 
the two water jet crewboats are expected to be delivered in january and february of the two fast  crew supply vessels are expected to be delivered in june and september of as of march   the company had expended million for the construction of these four vessels

index to financial statements while the company has an aggressive program of new build commitments to replace its aging fleet of vessels over time  the company s strong balance sheet and available liquidity allows it to be opportunistic in the enhancement of that program  of which the company anticipates taking advantage over the next several years 
the majority of the company s core group of older vessels  its supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and may be replaced within the next several years depending on the strength of the market during this time frame 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacities or new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund over the next few years the continuing replacement of the company s mature fleet of vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s aging vessels in the core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company stays in regular contact with its historical sources of capital and liquidity and monitors most other capital markets on an on going basis 
in spite of the current turmoil in capital markets caused by the evolving sub prime crisis the company believes that adequate capital and liquidity will be available to fund the continuation of its fleet replacement program  although the terms and pricing of such capital or borrowings may be on terms that are not as advantageous as the company has enjoyed historically 
the company has recently experienced some delays in the expected deliveries of equipment for vessels under construction as has the offshore supply vessel industry in general 
the delays experienced by the company to date are reflected in the revised table set forth above 
further delays could continue to negatively impact the deliveries scheduled above  and the table above is therefore subject to continued modification as and when such information becomes available

general market conditions and consolidated results of operations offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
the company s revenues and operating profit are primarily driven by fleet size  vessel utilization and day rates because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors which affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
drydocking costs are only incurred if economically justified  taking into consideration the vessel s age  physical condition and future marketability 
if the required drydocking is not performed  the vessel is either stacked or sold as it cannot work without the proper certifications 
a certain number of drydockings are required over a given period to meet regulatory requirements 
when the company takes a productive vessel out of service for drydocking  the company incurs not only the drydocking cost but also the loss of revenue from that vessel during the drydock period 
in any given period  downtime associated with drydockings and major repairs and maintenance can have a significant effect on the company s revenue stream and on vessel utilization rates 
in the current environment of record dayrates in the international markets the company operates in  vessel downtime for drydockings has taken on an increasing importance to the company and its financial performance 
strong demand for the company s mature vessels has resulted in continued drydockings of these older vessels which extend the lives of the vessels 
in addition  the company s newer vessels  built over the last eight years  are now experiencing their first and second required regulatory drydockings 
these facts have resulted in increased levels of expenditures for drydockings and significant impact on operating revenues 
although the company attempts to manage the scheduling of the drydockings to minimize the associated costs and loss of revenue  recent inflation in shipyard pricing and the heavy workloads at the shipyards are resulting in increased costs and increased loss of revenue 
the company does not see the shipyard situation changing much in the foreseeable future and expects that the timing of drydockings in the future will result in continued quarterly volatility in repair and maintenance cost and loss in revenue 
fuel and lube costs can fluctuate in any given period depending on the number of mobilizations that occur in any given period 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company also incurs vessel operating costs which are aggregated under the other vessel operating cost heading 
these costs consist of brokers commissions  training costs and other type costs 
brokers commission costs are primarily incurred in the company s international operations where brokers assist in obtaining work for the company s vessels 
brokers are paid a percentage of day rates and  accordingly  as revenues increase so do commissions paid to brokers 
other type costs include  but are not limited to  satellite communication fees  agent fees  port fees  canal transit fees  vessel certification fees and temporary importation fees 
the following table compares revenues and operating expenses excluding general and administrative expenses  depreciation expense and gains on sales of assets for the company s vessel fleet and the related percentage of total revenue for the years ended march vessel revenues and operating costs relate to vessels owned and operated by the company  while other marine revenues relate to third party activities of the company s shipyards  brokered vessels and other miscellaneous marine related activities

the company will recognize the amounts as revenue as cash is collected or at such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal market conditions the company s consolidated net earnings during fiscal dipped a modest  or million  as compared to fiscal  however  included in fiscal consolidated earnings is an after tax gain of million  related to the sale of of its offshore tugs 
excluding the after tax gain on the sale of the offshore tugs  consolidated net earnings increased approximately during the comparative periods primarily due to generating higher revenues on the company s international based vessels which were slightly offset by higher vessel operating costs and general and administrative expenses 
the company s united states us revenues decreased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal while the company s international revenues increased million  or approximately  during the same comparative period 
a significant portion of the company s operations are conducted internationally 
revenues generated during fiscal from international operations as a percentage of the company s total revenues were 
net earnings during fiscal also benefited from a reduction in the company s effective tax rate to from in fiscal the company s us results of operations during fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower utilization and average day rates on the us based vessels  the transfer of vessels to international areas of operations  and the sale of the company s us based offshore tugs during fiscal consistent with public reports  demand for vessels in the shallow water gulf of mexico offshore vessel market has diminished as repair work has been completed on the offshore energy infrastructure that was damaged by hurricane ivan in and hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september  respectively  and numerous drilling rigs have relocated to international areas 
the number of available drilling rigs in the us market should continue to be the primary driver of the company s future profitability in the us market and  at present  the offshore rig count in the gulf of mexico remains at very low levels as compared to past industry up cycles 
the strength of the international drilling market has attracted offshore rigs from the us market over the past few years and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
over the longer term  the company s us based fleet should be affected more by the active offshore rig count in the united states than by any other single outside influence 
in addition  consolidation could result in the absorption of an oil and gas company with whom the company has a strong commercial relationship with into another company with which the company does not 
worldwide rig construction continues as rig owners attempt to capitalize on the high worldwide demand for drilling 
published reports suggest that over the next three to four years  the worldwide moveable drilling rig count will increase as new build rigs currently on order and under construction stand at approximately

index to financial statements rigs which will supplement the current approximate movable rigs worldwide 
in addition  approximately new floating production units are currently under construction  which are expected to be delivered over the next three to four years 
approximately new build vessels are expected to be delivered to the worldwide offshore vessel market within the next four years as reported by ods petrodata 
an increase in vessel capacity could result in increased competition in the company s industry which may have the effect of lowering charter rates 
however  the worldwide offshore marine vessel industry has a large number of aging vessels that are nearing or exceeding their original estimated economic lives 
these older vessels could potentially retire from the market within the next few years if the cost of extending the vessels lives is not economically justifiable 
although the future attrition rate of these aging vessels cannot be accurately predicted  the company believes that the retirement of a portion of these aging vessels may negate  at least in part  the potential effects the offshore marine vessel industry may encounter when the new build vessels are delivered to the market 
additional vessel demand should be created with the addition of new build drilling rigs and floating production units over the next few years which should help minimize the effects of new build vessels being added to the offshore support vessel fleet 
at march   the company had in its fleet vessels that were acquired or constructed in the last eight years as part of its new build and acquisition program new vessels and remaining vessels  which are considered to be mature in age  with an average age of years 
during fiscal  the company s new vessels accounted for of total vessel profitability vessel revenues less vessel operating expenses less vessel depreciation while the more mature vessels accounted for the remaining 
as suggested above  these more mature vessels could potentially retire from the market over the next several years  but the earnings capacity of these mature vessels is expected to be replaced  and potentially surpassed  by newer vessels expected to be added to the company fleet over a similar period of time 
commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas are critical factors in exploration and production e p companies decision to retain their drilling rigs in the us gulf of mexico market or mobilize the rigs to more profitable international markets 
for most of calendar year  natural gas prices were relatively weak as a result of higher than normal inventory levels for the resource 
prices have strengthened since mid november as inventory levels for the resource decreased due to some production shut ins  lower liquid natural gas imports and colder than normal late winter weather 
winter ending storage levels are expected to be approximately below last year s level which bodes well for natural gas pricing during calendar year assuming storage levels do not approach full capacity during the summer injection season as has been the case during calendar years and the company s us results of operations are primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production and  given the relative volatility and uncertainty in natural gas pricing  it is unknown how us based vessel demand will be affected 
the central gulf of mexico lease sale held in march indicated strong interest in the gulf s deepwater and ultra deepwater tracts 
interest in shallow and mid water tracts was mixed as total funds exposed were lower at the march sale compared to the october sale  however  the average high bids for these water depths increased as compared to the october sale 
a significant number of rigs departed the gulf of mexico over the years and it may be difficult to bring rigs back to the gulf given the strength in the international market 
while all of these factors create uncertainty as to the immediate future activity level of the us vessel market  the company s assets are highly mobile and should the us market weaken further  the company has the ability to redeploy its vessels to international markets where the vessels may benefit from strong average day rates and earnings taxed at statutory income tax rates that are typically lower than in the united states 
in reaction to rigs departing the gulf of mexico during the latter part of calendar year  the company relocated nine vessels during fiscal to international locations where the vessels were contracted for more attractive term work at generally higher day rates than what the vessels were achieving in the gulf of mexico 
the company also relocated two vessels back to the gulf of mexico during fiscal the company will continue to assess the demand for vessels in the gulf of mexico and consider relocating additional vessels to stronger international areas as necessary 
the company transferred vessels to international locations during fiscal

index to financial statements one investment banking firm reported in their e p expenditures survey that global capital expenditures budgets for e p are forecast to increase between and during calendar year over calendar year levels 
the surveys forecast that international capital spending budgets will increase between to due to strong crude oil prices while a modest to increase is expected in north american capital spending budgets due to uncertainty in natural gas prices 
the strength in the company s fiscal international based results of operations can be attributed to higher average day rates and an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally 
average day rates for the total international based fleet increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s international results of operations have been primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship of crude oil 
crude oil prices soared during calendar year and surpassed the per barrel mark during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal analysts expect future crude oil prices to remain at strong price levels for the rest of calendar year and well beyond due to strong global consumer demand for crude oil which is driven by emerging economies  dwindling excess opec production capacity  continuing concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain countries that are members of opec  and production declines in mature oil fields 
management anticipates international vessel demand will remain strong as long as crude oil prices remain at levels that would support e p companies continuing to expend their anticipated e p spending budgets

while international based vessel revenues improved during fiscal  revenue growth was slowed by an increased number of maintenance days during fiscal  resulting from a higher level of drydockings performed 
while repair and maintenance expense increased only  capitalized repair and maintenance costs for fully depreciated vessels that extended their useful lives increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal  or an increase of approximately 
the increased number of maintenance days negatively impacted the utilization statistics of the company s vessels during fiscal international based vessel operating profit increased approximately or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenues 
higher international based revenues earned during fiscal were partially offset by increases in vessel operating costs primarily crew costs due to basic inflationary increases in labor costs around the world  repair and maintenance costs  insurance and loss reserves  fuel  lube and supplies and other vessel costs and higher depreciation expense resulting from an increase in the number of vessels operating internationally  including newly constructed vessels added to the international based fleet over the past year 
other items the company performed a thorough review of all the vessels in its fleet for asset impairment during the third quarter of fiscal the review resulted in no impairment charge 
the company s thorough review of all the vessels in its fleet for asset impairment during fiscal also resulted in no impairment charge 
during fiscal  gain on sales of assets decreased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the large gain recorded from the sale of offshore tugs during fiscal the transaction resulted in an approximate million pre tax financial gain  or approximately million after tax  or per diluted common share after tax 
dispositions of vessels can vary from quarter to quarter  therefore  gains on sales of assets may fluctuate significantly from period to period

the company s revenues generated by vessels working internationally increased approximately  or million  during fiscal as compared to fiscal while revenues generated by vessels working in the united states increased million  or approximately  during the same comparative period 
higher average day rates and utilization on all vessel classes operating internationally were the cause of the strength of the company s international based results of operations during fiscal average day rates for the total international based fleet increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal while utilization for the entire international based fleet increased approximately during the same comparative period 
the company s international results of operations are primarily dependent on the supply and demand relationship for crude oil 
crude oil prices were quite volatile during fiscal but remained in a price range that was attractive to the e p companies 
at the end of march  crude oil prices were in the low s due to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec commitment to maintain at that time a price floor by deciding in november to cut oil production by one million barrels per day 
analysts forecast that global demand for crude oil would likely remain strong in calendar year and crude oil prices were expected to remain at attractive levels due to high worldwide consumer demand for oil  relatively low excess opec production capacity  opec s intention to defend a specific floor price for crude oil and continued concerns over possible supply interruptions caused by geopolitical risk in certain countries that are members of opec 
higher utilization and average day rates were also the basis of the company s improved us results of operations during fiscal as compared to fiscal average day rates increased on all vessel classes operating in the us market 
total average day rates  on the entire us based fleet  increased approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal utilization for the total us based fleet increased approximately during the same comparative period 
fiscal s strong financial performance was a result of several significant improvements that occurred in the offshore support vessel market prior to fiscal during the first half of calendar year  the market for offshore support vessels improved as a result of the tightening of the supply of offshore support vessels due to high demand associated with the continuation of repair work to the offshore energy infrastructure that was damaged by hurricane ivan in calendar year hurricanes katrina and rita  which caused extensive damage to the energy industry infrastructure in the oil producing areas of the us gulf coast in late august and september  respectively  further tightened the offshore vessel market as e p companies competed to find available vessels for the necessary repair work resulting from the damage caused by the two storms 
demand for the company s vessels  in the gulf of mexico  prior to the two storms had already strengthened and business after the storms propelled charter rates past levels achieved in the and industry upturns 
however  consistent with public reports  the company did experience some softening in the shallow water offshore vessel market as the needed infrastructure repair work slowed and as numerous drilling rigs began relocating to international areas 
the company s us results of operations are primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production  and natural gas prices were relatively weak during calendar year as inventory levels exceeded five year averages due to mild weather 
by mid calendar year  natural gas inventories exceeded the five year average by as reported by the department of energy and were well on their way to maximum storage capacity by the end of the summer which helped drive natural gas prices below per mcf 
natural gas prices strengthened soon after calendar year began as demand for natural gas increased due to late winter cold temperatures in the northern hemisphere which reduced inventories to normalized levels 
in reaction to the rigs departing the gulf of mexico during the latter part of calendar year  and the relative volatility and uncertainty in natural gas pricing  the company relocated vessels to international areas during fiscal where the vessels were contracted for more attractive term work at effectively more profitable dayrates than what the vessels were achieving in the gulf of mexico 
the company continuously assessed the demand for the vessels operating in the gulf and considers relocating additional vessels to stronger international areas as necessary

international crew costs increased primarily because the newer  technically sophisticated anchor handling towing supply vessels and platform supply vessels that have been added to the fleet generally require a greater number of specially trained fleet personnel than the older smaller vessels in the fleet 
these same vessels incur higher maintenance costs as a result of the increased complexity and sophistication of the newer equipment installed on the vessels

interest and miscellaneous income increased approximately  or million  as compared to fiscal because the company had higher levels of cash invested in short term  interest bearing securities during fiscal than in fiscal vessel class statistics vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates 
vessel utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of days a vessel works during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel is available to work in the reporting period 
average day rates are calculated by dividing the revenue a vessel earns during a reporting period by the number of days the vessel worked in the reporting period 
vessel utilization and average day rates are calculated only on vessels in service and  as such  do not include vessel withdrawn from service or joint venture vessels

the company considers a vessel to be stacked if its crew is removed from the vessel and limited maintenance is being performed on the vessel 
this action is taken to reduce operating costs when management does not foresee adequate marketing possibilities for the vessel in the near future 
vessels are added to this list when market conditions warrant and they are removed from this list when sold or otherwise disposed of or when returned to active service 
as economically practical marketing opportunities arise  the stacked vessels can be returned to service by performing any necessary maintenance on the vessel and returning fleet personnel to operate the vessel

other liquidity matters while the company has an aggressive program of new build commitments to replace its aging fleet of vessels over time  the company s strong balance sheet and available liquidity allow it to be opportunistic in the enhancement of that program  of which the company anticipates taking advantage over the next several years 
the majority of the company s core group of older vessels  its supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and may be replaced within the next several years depending on the strength of the market during this time frame 
in addition to age  market conditions also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacities or new borrowings or lease arrangements to fund over the next few years the continuing replacement of the company s mature fleet of vessels 
these vessels would replace the company s aging vessels in the core international fleet with fewer  larger and more efficient vessels 
the company stays in regular contact with its historical sources of capital and liquidity and monitors most other capital markets on an on going basis 
in spite of the current turmoil in capital markets caused by the evolving sub prime crisis the company believes that adequate capital and liquidity will be available to fund the continuation of its fleet replacement program  although the terms and pricing of such capital or borrowings may be on terms that are not as advantageous as the company has enjoyed historically

the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts at times include escalation clauses to recover increases in specific costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to three months 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period

index to financial statements receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related weighted average cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit goodwill  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset group are compared with the carrying amount of the asset group to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flows based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value 
vessels with similar operating and marketing characteristics are grouped for asset impairment testing 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce materially different results 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions or poor operating results that could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of an asset group  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as the company s fleet continues to age  management closely monitors the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis to properly identify evolving trends and changes in market conditions that could impact the results of the impairment evaluation 
in addition to the periodic review of long lived assets for impairment when circumstances warrant  the company also performs a review of its stacked vessels and vessels withdrawn from service every six months 
this review considers items such as the vessel s age  length of time stacked and likelihood of a return to active service  among others 
the company records an impairment charge when the carrying value of a vessel withdrawn from service or stacked vessel that is unlikely to return to service exceeds its estimated fair value 
no impairment was recorded in fiscal or during fiscal  a million impairment charge was recorded 
income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets is based on the company s present belief that it is more likely than not that it will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record or adjust valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for changes to valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the present need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
vessel modifications that are performed for a specific customer contract are capitalized and amortized over the firm contract term 
the majority of the company s vessels require a drydocking inspection twice in each five year period  and the company schedules these drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
accrued property and liability losses 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan covering eligible employees of tidewater inc and participating subsidiaries 
the company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan that covers eligible us fleet personnel and eligible employees of the company hired after december  and a post retirement plan for qualified retired employees 
net periodic pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations are determined using a number of assumptions including the discount rate  the rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
the company s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  amortization of prior service costs or benefits  expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the company considers a number of factors in developing its pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term returns on plan assets  plan asset allocations  expected changes in wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
the company also provides postretirement benefits to qualified retired employees 
the postretirement program provides limited health care and life insurance benefits 
costs of the program are based on actuarially determined amounts and are accrued over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees who are expected to qualify for these benefits 
this plan is not funded

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the company s operating costs 
the major impact on operating costs is the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy exploration and production companies 
as the spending increases  prices of goods and services used by the energy industry and the energy services industry will increase 
future increases in vessel day rates may shield the company from the inflationary effects on operating costs 
due to the increase in business activity resulting from strong global oil and gas fundamentals  the competitive market for experienced crew personnel has exerted upward pressure on wages in the labor markets which increased the company s operating expenses 
in addition  strong fundamentals have also increased the activity levels at shipyards worldwide  which has led to increased pricing for both repair work and new construction work at shipyards 
also  the commodity price of steel has increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand for the metal 
the price of steel is high by historical standards and although prices moderated some since calendar year  availability of iron ore  the main component of steel  is tighter today than in when prices for iron ore increased dramatically 
if the price of steel continues to rise  the cost of new vessels will result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expenses which will reduce the company s future operating profits  unless day rates increase commensurately 
environmental matters during the ordinary course of business the company s operations are subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations 
compliance with existing governmental regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  has not had  nor is expected to have  a material effect on the company 
the company is proactive in establishing policies and operating procedures for safeguarding the environment against any environmentally hazardous material aboard its vessels and at shore base locations 
whenever possible  hazardous materials are maintained or transferred in confined areas to ensure containment if accidents occur 
in addition the company has established operating policies that are intended to increase awareness of actions that may harm the environment
