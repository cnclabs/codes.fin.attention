our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview and outlook we are an advanced oncology diagnostics services company 
our mission is to combine innovative technologies  meaningful test results and world class expertise to improve outcomes of patients suffering from cancer 
with the completion of the human genome project in the late s  medical science has entered a new era of diagnostics that will move us closer than ever before to understanding the molecular causes for complex diseases  particularly cancer 
as a result  the landscape of cancer management is undergoing significant change 
there is now an escalating need for advanced oncology testing to provide physicians with necessary information on the cellular profile of a specific tumor  enabling them to select the most appropriate therapies 
in  we changed our corporate name and completed the first stage of the transformation of our business from chromavision medical systems  inc positioned as a medical device provider with a single application to clarient positioned as a technology and services company offering a full menu of advanced tests to assess and characterize cancer 
we gathered an experienced group of professionals from the anatomic pathology laboratory and the in vitro diagnostics businesses to carefully guide this transition 
we have achieved rapid growth by commercializing a set of services to provide the community pathologist with the latest in cancer diagnostic technology  anchored by our own proprietary image analysis technology and augmented by other key technologies 
in june we initiated the second stage of our business strategy when we signed a distribution and development agreement with dako a s dako  a danish company recognized as a worldwide leader in pathology diagnostics systems 
this enabled us to strengthen our legacy position as the leader in cellular digital image analysis with the acis automated image analysis system acis and accelerate our market penetration worldwide 
in  we focused on the execution of our plan to capitalize on the growth of the cancer diagnostics market 
we expanded on our base of immunohistochemistry ihc with the addition of flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish molecular testing 
these additions positioned clarient to move beyond solid tumor testing into the important area of leukemia lymphoma assessment 
we also completed a consolidation of our business by moving into a state of the art facility without disruption to our customers 
in march  we entered the third stage of our business strategy by selling our instrument systems business  consisting of certain tangible assets  inventory  intellectual property including the company s patent portfolio and the acis and chromavision trademarks  contracts and other assets used in the operations of the instrument systems business the technology business to carl zeiss microimaging  inc zeiss  an international leader in the optical and opto electronics industries the acis sale 
the acis sale provided us with additional financial resources to focus our efforts on the most profitable and fastest growing opportunities within our services business 
we believe our strength as a leading cancer diagnostics laboratory  our strong commercial reach with cancer focused pathologists  our unique pathsite suite of services  our deep domain expertise and access to robust intellectual property can propel our continued growth through the development of additional tests  unique analytical capabilities and other service offerings 
our focus is on identifying high quality opportunities to increase our profitability and differentiate clarient s service offerings in this highly competitive market 
an important aspect of our strategy is to create near and long term  high margin revenue generating opportunities by connecting our medical expertise and our intellectual property with our strong commercial team to commercialize novel diagnostic tests sometimes also referred to as novel markers or biomarkers  such as the clarient insight dx breast cancer profile which was announced in january novel diagnostic tests detect characteristics of an individual s tumor or disease that  once identified and qualified  allow for more accurate prognosis  diagnosis and treatment 
in addition  we are working to identify specific partners and technologies where we can assist in the commercialization of third party novel diagnostic tests 
we believe that broader discovery and use of novel diagnostic tests will clarify and simplify decisions for healthcare providers and the biopharmaceutical industry 
the growing demand for personalized medicine has generated a need for these novel diagnostic tests  creating a new market expected to reach billion in three to five years based on our internal estimates 
in  we are focusing on four primary areas financial discipline to bring us closer to profitability  leverage our commercial capability to launch new tests and maintain our revenue growth trajectory  expand commercial reach to new customers  as well as capitalize on our expanded menu of additional testing for existing customers  and strategic discipline to invest in high value expansion opportunities to increase shareholder value 
key indicators of our financial condition and operating performance our business is complex  and management is faced with several key challenges to reach profitability 
we made the decision to provide in house laboratory services in to give us an opportunity to capture a significant service related revenue stream from the much broader and expanding cancer diagnostic testing marketplace 
we have been experiencing revenue growth since the inception of this business line indicating successful execution of our sales plan and solid market acceptance of our service offerings 
management must manage the growth of this business  particularly the effects such growth has on our billings  collections and business processes 
we have yet to reach optimal financial metrics related to cash flow and operating margins due to our limited history in providing lab services 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  including diagnostic services administration  for the fiscal year ended december  were of total revenue  compared to in the prior year ended december  we expect an improving trend to continue as our revenues increase  offsetting our expenditures for selling expenses related to the ramp up of our sales force responsible for our diagnostics services  administration expenses related to diagnostic services  particularly the costs of pathology services and billing and  expenses in connection with key business development initiatives focused on targeted cancer therapies in various stages of clinical study 
on march   the company entered into an amended and restated senior subordinated revolving credit facility with safeguard the new mezzanine facility to renew and expand the senior subordinated revolving credit agreement  dated march   by and between the company and safeguard delaware  inc the initial mezzanine facility 
the new mezzanine facility  which has a stated maturity date of april   provides the company access to up to million in working capital funding 
borrowings under the new mezzanine facility will bear interest at an annual rate of  subject to increase by if amounts thereunder remain outstanding after june  as of march   the company had million of indebtedness outstanding under the new mezzanine facility 
proceeds from the new mezzanine facility were used to refinance indebtedness under the initial mezzanine facility  for working capital purposes and to repay in full and terminate the loan and security agreement  dated september   between the company  clarient diagnostic services  inc  clrt acquisition  llc and general electric capital corporation  as amended the ge capital facility  and certain related equipment lease obligations 
characteristics of our revenue and expenses revenue and billing 
revenues are derived primarily from billing insurers  pathologists and patients for the diagnostic services that we provide 
third party billing 
the majority of our revenue is currently generated from patients who utilize insurance coverage from medicare or third party insurance companies 
in these situations  we bill an insurer that pays a portion of the amount billed based on several factors including the type of coverage for example  hmo or ppo  whether the charges are considered to be in network or out of network  and the amount of any co pays or deductibles that the patient may have at that time 
the rates that are billed are typically a percentage of those amounts allowed by medicare for the service provided as defined by common procedural terminology cpt codes 
the amounts that are paid to us are a function of the payors practice for paying claims of these types and whether we have specific agreements in place with the payors 
we also have a medicare provider number that allows us to bill and collect from medicare 
laboratory services provided for patients with the assistance of automated image analysis technology are eligible for third party reimbursement under well established medical billing codes 
these billing codes are known as healthcare common procedure coding systems hcpcs codes and incorporate a coding system know as common procedural terminology cpt codes 
the billing codes are the means by which medicare and private insurers identify certain medical services that are provided to patients in the united states 
cpt codes are established by the american medical association ama 
the medicare reimbursement amounts are based on relative values  associated with the cpt codes  and are established by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms using a relative value system  with recommendations from the ama s relative value update committee and professional societies representing the various medical specialties a cpt code appropriate for computer assisted image analysis went into effect on january  the interim rates established for this code in were subsequently amended on january  under the new code  the total net medicare reimbursement for acis based procedures performed in physician offices or independent laboratories reflects a technical component and a professional component 
the technical component involves preparation of the patient sample and running the test on the acis  while the professional component involves the physician s reading and evaluation of the test results 
for and for the first six months of  these medicare rates were established at approximately and per test  respectively  which reflects approximately and for the technical component and and for the professional interpretation  respectively 
in california  where our laboratory performs these tests for our diagnostic services operation  medicare reimbursement was per test  of which was for the technical component and was for professional interpretation 
for and the first six months of  the california medicare rates were adjusted to approximately per test which reflects approximately and  respectively  for the technical component and and  respectively  for the professional interpretation 
client pathologist billing 
in some situations  we establish direct billing arrangements with our clients where we bill them for an agreed amount per test for the services provided and the client will then handle all billing directly with the private payors 
the amounts that may be charged to our clients is determined in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations 
patient billing 
these billings can result from co payment obligations  patient deductibles  circumstances where certain tests are not covered by insurance companies  and patients without any health insurance 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue includes laboratory personnel  depreciation of laboratory equipment  laboratory supplies and other direct costs such as shipping 
most of our cost of revenue structure is variable  except for staffing and related expenses which are semi variable and depreciation which is mostly fixed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits and costs attributable to the support of our operations  such as information systems  executive management  financial accounting  purchasing  administrative and human resources personnel  as well as office space and recruiting  legal  auditing and other professional services 
our current sales resources are targeting community pathology practices and hospitals  the sales process for this business group is designed to understand the customer s needs and develop appropriate solutions from our range of laboratory service options 
in addition  we incur administration costs of senior medical staff  senior operations personnel  billing and collection costs  consultants and legal resources to facilitate implementation and support of our operations 
collection costs are incurred from a combination of in house services and a third party billing and collection company that we have engaged to perform these services because of the high degree of technical complexity and knowledge required to effectively perform these operations 
these costs are generally incurred as a percentage of amounts collected 
during the third quarter of  the company expects to complete the process of bringing the billing and collection process entirely in house 
the company expects this will result in expense reductions in selling  general and administrative expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
management believes that the following estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue for our diagnostic services is recognized at the time of completion of services at amounts equal to the contractual rates allowed from third parties  including medicare and insurance companies 
these expected amounts are based both on medicare allowable rates and our collection experience with other third party payors 
because of the requirements and nuances of billing for laboratory services  we generally invoice amounts that are greater than those allowable for payment 
these differences are described as contractual discounts 
as noted  however  it is only the expected payment from these parties  which is net of these contractual discounts  that is recorded as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts  we review the age of receivables in various financial classes and estimate the uncollectible portion based on the type of payor  age of the receivables  and historical loss experience 
however  in all years presented  we outsourced the direct billing and collection of laboratory related receivables  and we worked closely with our outsourced billing partner to review the details of each laboratory related account 
as the company continues to grow its laboratory service operations test volume  we expect bad debt expense to increase 
long lived assets and accruals we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets  for impairment whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  the asset is then written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow basis 
based on our review as of december   no impairments were recorded 
for other obligations requiring management s use of estimates  we review the basis for assumptions about future events and conditions  which are inherently subjective and uncertain 
in determining whether a contingent liability should be accrued  management applies standards under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a contingent liability if the exposure is considered probable and reasonably estimable 
results of operations the following table presents our results of operations as percentages of revenue percentage of revenues year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative loss from operations interest  net income loss from discontinued operations net loss fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenue total revenue increased or million from million for the fiscal year ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended december  this increase resulted from the execution of our marketing and sales strategy to increase our sales to new and existing customers 
this increase also takes into consideration the  reduction in revenue related to the credit issue discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we added new customers in and increased our penetration to existing customers during the year 
in addition we increased our breadth of offerings to include multiple cancer types  including expanding our lymphoma leukemia business  and performing testing in other solid tumors such as colon  prostate and lung 
this testing was performed using our expanded capabilities in immunohistochemistry  flow cytometry  fish and pcr 
we also increased our depth of offering within each cancer type 
we anticipate revenues will continue to increase as a result of increased revenue from existing customers  the addition of new customers and our offering of a more comprehensive suite of advanced and or proprietary cancer diagnostic tests 
cost of revenue and gross margin for the fiscal year ended december   our gross margin was compared to in the increase in gross margin in was attributable to achieving economies of scale in our operations and a shift to more profitable tests 
we anticipate gross margins will continue to increase as we more effectively utilize our capacity and expand our breadth of test offerings 
cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million compared to million for december   an increase of 
these costs include costs associated with laboratory personnel  lab related depreciation expense  laboratory reagents and supplies and other direct costs such as courier and other shipping costs 
as volume and revenue grows these costs will grow as well 
however  we expect the growth to be slower than overall revenue growth due to economies of scale  better vendor agreements  and mix of testing 
operating and other expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased from for the fiscal year ended december  to for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in expenses in was due primarily to expenses incurred to generate and support revenue growth and to improve infrastructure  including selling and marketing expenses  billing and collection costs  and bad debt expenses 
in addition  we have increased headcount and consulting resources in information technology to support our expanded offering and for future revenue growth 
in we also incurred incremental stock based compensation expense for options issued in  higher professional fees and severance costs 
we anticipate sales expenses will continue to grow to support our expected revenue growth  and we expect general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues as our infrastructure costs stabilize 
interest expense and other income 
interest expense and other income for the fiscal year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of net interest expense 
the increase was due to higher outstanding borrowings under our financing facilities as well as warrants issued to safeguard  our majority stockholder  in partial consideration for the guarantee of our credit facility with comerica bank by safeguard and in connection with the establishment and borrowings under the initial mezzanine facility 
the fair value of million related to these warrants was included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  revenue total revenue increased or million from million for the fiscal year ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended december  this increase resulted from the execution of our marketing and sales strategy to increase our sales to new customers and to enter into new managed care contracts 
this increase was also driven in part by increasing the number of available tests being performed that include immunohistochemistry  flow cytometrys and fish 
cost of revenue and gross margin for the fiscal year ended december   our gross margin was compared to in cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period of  an increase of 
these costs included laboratory personnel  lab related depreciation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct costs such as shipping 
the increase in gross margin in was attributable to achieving economies of scale in our diagnostics laboratory operations 
operating and other expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million compared to million for as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased from for the fiscal year ended december  to for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in rent expense related to our new facility  increases in selling expenses to support the growing diagnostics services business  higher stock based compensation expense due to the implementation of sfas no 
r and relocation and recruiting expenses 
interest expense and other income 
interest expense and other income for the fiscal year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  and primarily consisted of approximately million of net interest expense  offset by approximately million of interest income 
the increase in interest expense is due to the increased borrowings under our financing facilities and the debt guarantee fee charged by safeguard 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under the initial mezzanine facility with safeguard 
however  we had a working capital deficiency of million at december  cash used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  due primarily to our net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of million  partially offset by non cash costs and expenses of million for depreciation  stock based compensation and bad debt 
cash provided by investing activities of million consisted of the proceeds  net of selling costs  of million received from the sale of the technology business  which was partially offset by capital expenditures of million related primarily to new laboratory equipment and information technology infrastructure enhancements 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year was million and was attributable primarily to net borrowings of million under our revolving lines of credit and our mezzanine facility  which were partially offset by principal payments of million on capital leases 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  due primarily to our net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and other working capital changes 
cash used in investing activities of million consisted of million used to fund capital expenditures related primarily to purchases of new laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements at the new facility and million used by investing activities of discontinued operations 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million provided by our revolving lines of credit  million in issuance of common stock  including stock option exercises and million provided by financing activities of discontinued operations 
in june  we entered into a master lease agreement with ge capital for capital equipment financings of diagnostic services laboratory related equipment 
we financed million in  million in and million through december  of capital equipment under this arrangement  which were recorded as capital lease obligations 
during  several of these leases matured and we elected to refinance million of this equipment as capital leases 
during the first quarter of  we used million in borrowings under the new mezzanine facility to pay off and terminate all of our equipment lease obligations to ge capital 
we believe that we have substantially all of the laboratory equipment that is required to support our current operating activities  however  a substantial increase in diagnostic service activity in excess of our annual revenue plan may result in a requirement to make additional capital expenditures 
in july  we signed a ten year lease for a new facility  which began december  with two five year renewal options 
we relocated our laboratory operations to the new facility in january and relocated our corporate headquarters and manufacturing operation to the new facility in the second quarter of the landlord of the new facility agreed to fund approximately million of tenant improvements  subject to the terms of the lease agreement 
as of december   we have spent approximately million on tenant improvements and equipment purchases to build out the facility 
of the million spent through december   the landlord has funded million and we expect the landlord to fund the balance of million of lessor concession no later than december  rent expense was million for the fiscal year ended december  during the first quarter of  we entered into sublease agreements with two tenants who made lease and common area expense payments of million during the fiscal year ended december  on september   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with safeguard pursuant to which safeguard purchased  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purpose of this financing was to fund the purchase of trestle holdings  inc  and trestle acquisition corp 
a wholly owned subsidiary of trestle holdings  inc collectively  trestle  and is referred to as the trestle financing 
in exchange for safeguard s funding commitment  we also issued safeguard  warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share reflecting the trailing day average closing price of our common stock prior to june  the warrants issued in the trestle financing are exercisable for a period of four years after the issued date of september  following consummation of the trestle financing  safeguard beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in connection with this financing  we agreed to register the shares purchased by safeguard upon request by safeguard 
on september   we entered into a revolving credit facility with ge capital the ge capital facility which consisted of a senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to which we could borrow up to million  subject to adjustment 
at december  we had million of borrowings outstanding under this facility  and had no availability based on the amount of our qualified accounts receivable as of december  as further described above  we repaid all amounts owed under the ge capital facility during the first quarter of and terminated this facility 
we currently have a million revolving credit agreement with comerica bank which we amended and restated in february the comerica facility 
borrowings under the comerica facility totaled million at december  and are being used for working capital purposes  and the remaining availability under the comerica facility was used to obtain a million stand by letter of credit for the landlord of our leased facility in aliso viejo  california 
the comerica facility matures on february   and  as of december   the company had no additional availability under the comerica facility 
during  borrowings under the comerica facility bore interest at the bank s prime rate minus and included one financial covenant related to tangible net worth 
under the amended and restated comerica facility  at the company s option  borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate minus  or a rate equal to libor plus  provided  however  that upon the achievement of certain financial performance metrics the rate will decrease by 
we were not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant as of december  and in certain prior periods  and we have obtained a waiver from comerica bank with respect thereto 
under the terms of the amended comerica facility  we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth which is defined as the sum of capital stock and additional paid in capital  plus retained earnings or minus accumulated deficit  minus intangible assets of the following amounts negative million  for the period from january  through march   negative million  for the period april  through june   negative million  for the period from july  through september   negative million  for the period from october  through december  and negative million  plus of profits profit recapture thereafter 
the financial covenant contained in the comerica facility is based on the assumption that our results from operations in will significantly improve from our historical results of operations 
in addition  we have previously not been able to maintain compliance with prior financial covenants in our credit facilities with respect to certain periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenant in this credit facility 
safeguard guarantees borrowings under the comerica facility in exchange for an annual fee of of the amount guaranteed and an amount equal to per annum of the daily weighted average principal balance outstanding million as of december   inclusive of the above referenced letter of credit 
additionally  under the comerica facility we are required to pay safeguard a quarterly usage fee of of the amount by which the daily average principal balance outstanding under the comerica facility exceeds million 
we also issued warrants to safeguard in march as consideration for their guarantee as follows warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for an exercise price of per share for safeguard s guarantee of million  warrants to purchase  shares for an exercise price of as a commitment fee for safeguard s guarantee of the million increase in the line  and warrants to purchase  shares for an exercise price of as a maintenance fee for safeguard s guarantee of the million increase in the line 
the fair value of warrants issued was determined under the black scholes model  and the related debt discount is recognized as expense over the applicable period of the commitment 
the safeguard guarantee was also extended along with the renewal of comerica facility in february under the same terms as the extension 
no additional warrants were issued as part of the extended guarantee 
on march   we obtained the initial mezzanine facility from safeguard 
the initial mezzanine facility originally provided us up to million in working capital funding  but was reduced by million as a result of the acis sale 
borrowings under the initial mezzanine facility bore interest at an annual rate of 
in connection with the initial mezzanine facility  we issued to safeguard warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  expiring march   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share reflecting a discount to the trailing day average closing price of our common stock prior to march   expiring march   and four year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share in connection with borrowings that we made thereunder 
as of december  the company had drawn million against the mezzanine facility 
on march   the company entered into an amended and restated senior subordinated revolving credit facility with safeguard the new mezzanine facility to renew and expand the initial mezzanine facility 
the new mezzanine facility  which has a stated maturity date of april   provides the company access to up to million in working capital funding 
the new mezzanine facility will come due earlier upon i full repayment by the company of its senior debt  ii certain sales  mergers or consolidations of the company which would result in a sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets or safeguard no longer owning a majority of the company s common stock  or iii the liquidation of the company 
in the event the company completes a financing of debt or equity securities resulting in net proceeds to the company of at least  the company will be required to pay down all amounts outstanding under the new mezzanine facility and the maximum aggregate size of the new mezzanine facility will be reduced to million 
borrowings under the new mezzanine facility bear interest at an annual rate of 
as of march   the company had outstanding indebtedness of approximately million under the new mezzanine facility 
proceeds from the new mezzanine facility were used to refinance indebtedness under the initial mezzanine facility  for working capital purposes and to repay in full and terminate the ge capital facility and certain related equipment lease obligations 
in connection with the new mezzanine facility  the company issued safeguard five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  which included warrants to purchase  shares which were the subject of amounts that had not been drawn under the initial mezzanine facility 
the fair value of the warrants issued was determined under the black scholes model  and the related debt discount will be recognized as interest expense ratably over the term of this agreement related to these warrants 
in addition  under the new mezzanine facility  the company will be required to issue additional five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share on may  if a new secured credit facility has not been completed prior to such date and up to an aggregate of an additional  warrants will be issuable in three separate tranches if the aggregate size of the of the new mezzanine facility has not been reduced to million on or prior to dates specified therein 
our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes that the company will have sufficient resources to pay its obligations as they become due during the next twelve months and do not reflect adjustments that might result if we were not to continue as a going concern 
however  we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations  and future profitability is uncertain 
in addition  we have an accumulated deficit  stockholders deficit and a working capital deficiency  and a history of not complying with the covenants within our credit agreements 
such defaults were waived and we have agreed to a new financial covenant relating to tangible net worth in our credit facility with comerica bank for we entered into the amended credit facility with the expectation that we could meet the financial covenant 
however  in order to do so  our results of operations in will have to meet levels not historically achieved by the company 
failure to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our comerica facility would constitute an event of default under that facility and a cross default under the new mezzanine facility 
absent a waiver from both lenders  borrowings under both facilities would become immediately due and payable 
the company does not currently have the ability to repay borrowings under these facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully access existing financing sources or obtain additional debt or equity financing when needed or on terms that are favorable to the company and its stockholders  or will be able to obtain waivers from its lenders in the event of non compliance with its debt covenants 
as a result of these matters  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern

recent accounting pronouncements several new accounting standards have been issued and adopted recently 
none of these standards had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 

sfas no

 which allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between entities that elect different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
management is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas no 
applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except sfas no 
r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted fin  effective january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the eitf issued a consensus on eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the task force reached a consensus on how to determine whether an arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangement  how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties should be reported by the partners to a collaborative arrangement in each of their respective income statements  how payments made to or received by a partner pursuant to a collaborative arrangement should be presented in the income statement  and what participants should disclose in the notes to the financial statements about a collaborative arrangement 
this issue shall be effective for annual periods beginning after december  entities should report the effects of applying this issue as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all periods to the extent practicable 
upon application of this issue  the following should be disclosed a a description of the prior period information that has been retrospectively adjusted  if any  and b the effect of the change on revenue and operating expenses or other appropriate captions of changes in the applicable net assets or performance indicator and on any other affected financial statement line item

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have invested excess cash in short term debt securities that are intended to be held to maturity
