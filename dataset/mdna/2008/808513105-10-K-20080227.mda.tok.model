for a discussion of the company s risk management  including technology and operating risk  credit risk  concentration risk  and legal and regulatory risk  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management 
developments in the business  economic  and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company s business

a significant decrease in the company s liquidity could negatively affect the company s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the company 
maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company  including margin lending  mortgage lending  and transaction settlement  among other liquidity needs 
also  a reduction in csc s liquidity position could adversely affect csc s ability to repay debt  pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of its stock 
if the company s broker dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines  regulators could limit the subsidiaries operations or their ability to upstream funds to csc 
any such limitations could have an adverse effect on csc  which depends primarily on cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill its debt service obligations and otherwise meet its liquidity needs 
in addition  a reduction in the company s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the company  which could result in the loss of client accounts 
the company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations 
the company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations  as well as cash provided by external financing 
fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances  as well as changes in market conditions  may affect the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
specific risk factors which may adversely affect the company s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts which may affect the amount of the company s liquid assets  a significant downgrade in the company s credit ratings which could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets  and a dramatic increase in the company s client lending activities including margin  mortgage  and personal lending which may reduce the company s liquid resources and excess capital position 
significant interest rate changes could affect the company s profitability and financial condition 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest earning assets such as margin loans  customer mortgages  and securities and its funding sources such as customer deposits and company borrowings 
changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interest earning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interest bearing liabilities 
overall  the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment  the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interest earning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on interest bearing liabilities  or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgage backed securities that the company holds 
the company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return 
in the event prevailing short term

the company s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will fail to perform its contractual obligations  or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk  the policies and procedures may not be fully effective

the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio which includes us agency and non agency collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate debt securities among other investments 
the company s loans to banking clients primarily consist of first lien mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit 
housing price declines  increases in delinquency and default rates  changes in the interest rate environment and other economic factors can result in write downs on such loans and the loss of value of securities available for sale 
heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the company s risk of loss 
examples of the company s credit concentration risk include large investment positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry  mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region  and margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry

during  several financial institutions provided credit or liquidity support for their sponsored money market funds 
although the company has no obligation to do so  the company could decide for competitive reasons to provide credit or liquidity support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings

this consolidation may continue 
competition is based on many factors  including the range of products and services offered  pricing  customer service  brand recognition  reputation  and perceived financial strength 
consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does  or offer such products at more competitive prices 

table of contents the charles schwab corporation the company faces intense competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees  especially for employees who are key to the company s ability to build and enhance client relationships

competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company s client relationships 
the company s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 
technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses  litigation  and regulatory actions 
the company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the company or its vendors that constrain the company s ability to gather  process  and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely  without interruptions

switching to an alternative service provider may also require a transition period and result in less efficient operations 
potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company s financial position

any such transaction could have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the process of evaluating  negotiating  and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management s attention from other business concerns  and might cause the loss of key clients  employees  and business partners 
moreover  integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties  including the need to integrate operational  financial  and management information systems and management controls  integrate relationships with clients and business partners  and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas 
in addition  an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation 
further  the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition  and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company s current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per share eps

these regulations often serve to limit the company s activities by way of capital  customer protection and market conduct requirements  and restrictions on the businesses in which the company may operate 
despite the company s efforts to comply with applicable regulations  there are a number of risks  particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance 
any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company s regulators against the company or its affiliates  officers or employees could result in fines  penalties  cease and desist orders  enforcement actions  or suspension or expulsion  any of which could harm the company s reputation and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the company s business and financial results 
new legislation  rule changes  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal  state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company or its specific business lines 
the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally  including changes to the laws governing taxation  electronic commerce  client privacy and security of client data

in addition  the company is responding to certain litigation claims brought against former subsidiaries pursuant to indemnities it has provided to purchasers of those entities 
the company believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is vigorously contesting liability and the damages claimed 
nevertheless  some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards  including penalties  injunctions  or other relief  and the company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation 
predicting the outcome of a matter is inherently difficult  particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages  or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage
