item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and other financial information included in this annual report on form k for the years ended december   and introduction we currently manage four operating segments based on the way management makes operating decisions and assesses performance inventiv clinical  which provides services related to permanent placement  clinical staffing  data collection and management and functional outsourcing 
inventiv communications  which provides services related to pharmaceutical advertising  branding  public relations  interactive communications and physician education 
inventiv commercial  which consists of our outsourced sales and marketing teams  planning and analytics services  sample accountability services  marketing support services  professional development and training  and recruitment of sales representatives in the commercial services area 
this segment includes inventiv strategy analytics and inventiv selling solutions 
inventiv patient outcomes  which provides services related to patient adherence  patient assistance and reimbursement  clinical educator teams and medical cost containment and disease management 
our non operating segment other encompasses the activities of the corporate management group 
our business is heavily dependent on the willingness and propensity of our customers to seek outsourced solutions for the services we provide 
we believe that our business has been positively affected by a trend of large pharmaceutical manufacturers toward utilizing outsourcing arrangements as a means of controlling variable unit cost and increasing flexibility 
although large contracts with these manufacturers remain an important component of our overall business activity  there is a potential for margin contraction and the termination of contracts resulting from downsizing and other cost control measures by large pharmaceutical manufacturers 
we believe that the increasing percentage of new drug application nda and new molecular entity nme approvals attributable to small and mid tier pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies presents an opportunity for companies providing outsourced services because these companies often prefer to employ high quality  third party service providers either directly or in co promotion situations with pharmaceutical partners to effect critical late stage developmental and commercialization functions  rather than building significant infrastructure internally 
we therefore target a broad spectrum of companies within the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry in seeking to develop business opportunities 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the following is a summary of our revenue recognition policy  based on the segment and services we provide inventiv clinical clinical staffing and recruiting revenues are recognized and recorded when services are rendered 
functional outsourcing revenues are recognized and recorded when milestones are achieved  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
executive placement revenues are recognized and recorded at the time a candidate begins full time employment 
any write offs due to cancellations and or billing adjustments historically have been insignificant 
inventiv communications advertising and communication support revenues are recognized and recorded under the proportional performance method  by relating the actual hours of work performed to date to the current estimated total hours of the respective projects 
any anticipated losses on projects are recognized when such losses are anticipated 
time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
public relations revenues are recognized and recorded as time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
branding revenues are recognized and recorded on a fee for service basis  in accordance with the terms of the contracts  and revenues for certain contracts are recorded based on completed contract method 
interactive communications revenues are recognized and recorded under the proportional performance method based on services performed 
patient and physician education revenues are recognized and recorded using either the completed contract method or when milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the specific contracts 
inventiv commercial inventiv pharma teams revenues and associated costs are recognized and recorded under pharmaceutical detailing contracts based on the number of physician calls made or the number of sales representatives utilized 
most of our sales and marketing teams contracts involve two phases  a implementation phase  formerly referred to as deployment phase  typically one to three months  in which we perform initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the deployment phase  formerly referred to as promotion phase  in which our deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients through face to face interactions with physicians or other targets referred to as detailing 
our inventiv pharma teams contracts specify a separate fee for the initial implementation phase of a project 
we consider the implementation phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognize the related revenues throughout the implementation phase  which typically spans a period of one to three months at the beginning of the first year of a contract 
we generally recognize revenue during the deployment phase of our inventiv pharma teams contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
the accounting for the two phases is based on our analysis of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in which we have concluded that the deployment and promotion phases are being sold separately and therefore qualify as separate units of accounting within the meaning of paragraph of eitf many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue from incentive fees is recognized and recorded when we are reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
non refundable conversion fees are recognized and recorded as revenue when one of our sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
recruiting revenues are recognized based on placement of candidates 
professional development and training revenues are generally recognized and recorded as training courses are completed 
regulatory compliance services regulatory compliance revenues for both fixed fees services and fees for specific compliance related services are recognized and recorded when monthly services are performed 
non personal promotion revenues are recognized and recorded based on time incurred and fulfillment requirements in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
virtual event services revenues are recognized based on the frequency and upon completion of live events 
sales force automation data analysis a majority of revenues are recognized based on straight line basis 
for certain analytics projects  revenues are recognized upon completion 
planning and analytics revenues for hpr generally include fixed fees  which are recognized and recorded when monthly services are performed based on the proportional performance method and when payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year 
revenues for additional services are recognized and recorded when the services are provided and payment is reasonably assured 
strategic consulting for most contracts  revenues are recognized and recorded on a fee for service basis  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
certain contracts are also recorded based on the proportional performance method 
product access and managed market support consulting fee revenues are recognized and recorded when services are rendered 
other services are based on milestones 
consulting and contract marketing revenues are recognized and recorded on a fee for service basis  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
inventiv patient outcomes patient pharmaceutical compliance programs revenues are mainly recognized based on the volume of correspondence sent to patients 
patient support programs patient assistance programs revenues depend on the number of patients served and are recognized and recorded as each service is performed 
clinical nurse educators  on call specialists  and medical science liaison programs revenue recognition is the same as inventiv pharma teams  as the two services are similar in the business arrangement and fee structure 
medical cost containment and consulting solutions the majority of revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis  based on an analysis of claims as a percentage of savings realized by our clients 
certain services are performed on a fee for services basis and recognized when the service is rendered 
general revenue recognition reimbursable costs reimbursable costs  including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to individual or product revenues  and other similar costs  are generally included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services in the period in which such amounts have been finalized 
in certain cases  based on our analysis of eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and related accounting literature  we may also record certain reimbursable transactions  such as the placement of media advertisements where we act as an agent  as net revenues 
loss contracts we periodically analyze our contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product  field force or other performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  we accrue that loss at the time it becomes probable 
we did not have any material loss contracts in  or billing customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as client advances and unearned revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon invoicing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled services 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are assessed for potential impairment pursuant to the guidelines of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis at june or when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of certain indicators of impairment 
we applied aggregation criteria consistent with the definitions under sfas  as well as the related guidance in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  for purposes of aggregating business units in our goodwill impairment testing 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a business unit 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
we calculate and compare the fair value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if we deem the useful life to be no longer indefinite after testing for impairment in accordance with the applicable rules stated above  we amortize the intangible asset over its remaining estimated useful life  following the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up and we continue to review for impairment on an annual basis 
we performed annual impairment tests as of june  and concluded that the existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible tradename balances were not impaired and continue to maintain this position as of december   based on various factors  including updated forecasts and the current condition of the company 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million and other intangibles net of million in the consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised sfas no 
sfas r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule amending the effective dates for sfas r 
in accordance with the new rule  the company adopted the accounting provisions of sfas r as of january  on january   the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method  as permitted under sfas r  which requires measurement of compensation cost of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service periods for awards expected to vest 
under this method  compensation cost in includes the portion vesting in the period for all stock based awards granted prior to  but not vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and all stock based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the company will recognize the cost of all employee stock awards on a straight line basis over their respective vesting periods  net of estimated forfeitures 
accordingly  prior periods amounts have not been restated 
under this method  the company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
with the adoption of sfas r in  the company has limited its issuance of stock options to senior executives  while granting restricted shares to employees at various levels 
during the fourth quarter of  prior to the adoption of sfas r  management analyzed its expected volatility and expected life of stock options and concluded that the expected volatility for options granted during the fourth quarter of should be and the expected life of the options granted should range between and years  depending on the grantee s employee status 
the company analyzed historical trends in these variables on a quarterly basis  during and the volatility remains at a range of 
for the year ended december  the company elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term as permitted by sab and the range of the expected term remained unchanged at to years 
the company continues to base the estimate of risk free rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the company has never paid cash dividends  does not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and has certain restrictions under its credit facility to pay dividends and thus has assumed a dividend yield 
these conclusions were based on several factors  including past company history  current and future trends  comparable benchmarked data and other key metrics 
as part of the requirements of sfas r  the company is required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
the forfeiture rate was estimated based on historical forfeitures 
the estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
the forfeiture rates utilized for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
claims and insurance accruals we maintain self insured retention limits for certain insurance policies 
the liabilities associated with the risk we retain are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions  which have been consistently applied 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation and auto liability claims and estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience with respect to all other liabilities 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  the actual liabilities could vary materially from management s estimates and assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
management believes that these reserves are adequate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of any loss carryforwards or capital losses 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary 
derivative financial instruments the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt 
at hedge inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  the company assesses whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
the fair values of the company s interest rate swaps are obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk long term debt exposure at december   we had million debt outstanding under our secured term loan as described in liquidity and capital resources in item above 
we will incur variable interest expense with respect to our outstanding loan 
this interest rate risk may be partially offset by our derivative financial instrument  as described below 
based on our debt obligation outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the variable interest rate would have an immaterial effect on interest expense due to the fixed rate associated with the derivative financial instrument 
derivative financial instrument effective october  we entered into an amortizing three year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million at inception to apply a fixed interest rate against the original six year million loan arrangement entered into to facilitate the acquisition of inventiv communications  inc we entered into this interest rate swap agreement to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding long term debt 
at inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest cash flows of the hedged item 
to the extent the derivatives instruments are highly effective hedges  the change in fair value of the effective portion is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
from october to july  we did not designate its original swap arrangement for hedge accounting and recorded an approximate million reduction to interest expense relating to the mark to market adjustment  and a corresponding derivative asset for approximately million  which was recorded in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of the interest rate swaps were obtained from dealer quotes 
the fair value of the swaps represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
on july   we formally designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we employed the dollar offset method to assess effectiveness by performing a shock test and utilized the hypothetical derivative method under dig issue g to measure ineffectiveness 
the hypothetical derivative contains the same terms and conditions as the debt agreement with an inception date of july  the hypothetical swap had a fair value of zero on the date of designation and the hedging swap had a fair value of million on the date of designation 
as the swap fair value will decline to zero at maturity  the million of fair value will be recognized in earnings over the remaining life of the swap as part of the ineffectiveness calculation 
during the year ended december   the fair market value of the original derivative asset decreased by million to a derivative liability of approximately million 
approximately million was recorded as interest expense  attributable to the financing component embedded within the interest rate swap  while the remaining million million  net of taxes was recorded as a decrease to other comprehensive income 
on september   we entered into a new amortizing five year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million at hedge inception  with an accretive notional amount increase to million effective december  to hedge the total outstanding debt notional when our original three year interest rate swap arrangement described above expires 
at hedge inception  we employed the dollar offset method by performing a shock test to assess effectiveness and utilized the hypothetical derivative method under dig issue g to measure ineffectiveness 
the hypothetical derivative contains the same terms and conditions as the original derivative 
as a result of the hypothetical derivative method  there was no ineffectiveness for the period ended december   and as a result  million million  net of taxes was recorded as a decrease to other comprehensive income and an increase to the swap liability  recorded as other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  foreign currency exchange rate exposure we are not currently affected by foreign currency exchange rate exposure  except for any fluctuations in the foreign bank accounts remaining from the divestitures of our european business units  from continuing operations of our uk  france and canadian subsidiaries and equity investments and minority interests in our foreign business units  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
our treatment of foreign subsidiaries is consistent with the guidelines set forth in sfas  foreign currency translations
