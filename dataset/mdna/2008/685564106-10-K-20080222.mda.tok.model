critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
revenues on long term fixed price contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and gross profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
certain contracts include provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based upon historical experience and other objective criteria 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues and profits would be adjusted and could therefore fluctuate significantly 
as of december  and december   unbilled receivables included million and million  respectively  of incentive fees on certain satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
certain satellite contracts require us to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of revenues under such contracts  a portion or all of which could be reversed in future periods if satellite performance criteria are not met 
we generally procure insurance policies that we believe would indemnify us for satellite incentive fees that are not earned and for performance refund obligations 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of estimated award fees on a contract that is subject to a final assessment at the conclusion of the contract  projected to occur in if the final award fee assessment is lower than the interim assessments  we would be required to record an unfavorable revenue and profit adjustment 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
cost is determined on an average cost or specific identification basis 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs could be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under this method  no compensation expense was recognized as long as the exercise price equaled or exceeded the market price of the underlying stock on the measurement date of the grant 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest  and the short cut method to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
we use the tax law ordering method as our policy for intra period tax allocation related to the tax attributes of stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our restricted stock unit grants is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from current estimates 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and prior period adjustment for adoption of new accounting standard as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  our financial statements have been adjusted as required by a new accounting standard pertaining to our l aircraft which is used in our pegasus launch vehicle program 
the effect of adopting the new accounting standard was not material to our financial statements 
compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were  million in  up compared to due to increased revenues in all business segments 
revenues in the advanced space programs segment  which prior to was aggregated and reported with the satellites and space systems segment  increased million  or  driven by contract activity on the orion crew exploration spacecraft program which began in late launch vehicles segment revenues increased million  or  principally due to higher target and interceptor vehicle revenues driven by increased contract activity on target vehicle and missile defense programs 
satellites and space systems segment revenues increased million  or  driven by growth in the communications satellites product line mainly due to activity on recently awarded contracts 
transportation management systems segment revenues increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in product sales supporting existing public fleet management systems in addition to activity on recently awarded contracts 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in  an increase compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in as compared to was due to a million  or  increase in our advanced space programs segment  a million  or  increase in our launch vehicles segment  a million  or  increase in our satellites and space systems segment and a million  or  increase in our transportation management systems segment 
the increase in gross profit in our advanced space programs segment was principally due to increased contract activity in on the orion program and the related profit contributed by this program 
the increase in launch vehicles segment gross profit was primarily due to increased activity on target vehicle and interceptor vehicle programs 
the increase in gross profit in our satellites and space systems segment was principally due to contract activity in on new communications satellite programs 
the increase in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to the increase in product sales mentioned above 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
these expenses related primarily to the development of enhanced launch vehicles and satellites  as well as improved product development initiatives in our transportation management systems segment 
we are engaged in a major new product development program to create a medium capacity rocket called taurus ii 
approximately million of the increase in research and development expenses was related to the taurus ii development program 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased only slightly in compared to  while revenues increased significantly during these periods 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses included higher business segment general and administrative expenses and higher personnel costs compared to  partially offset by a reduction in professional fees 
bid  proposal and marketing expenses remained relatively constant in and  largely due to certain major contract proposal activities in both years 
in  our stock based compensation expense was million  compared to million in  primarily related to restricted stock units granted in  and the majority of these costs are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses and the remainder are reported in cost of goods sold 
interest income and other interest income and other was million in  compared to million in  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively  on short term invested cash balances 
other income in included a million gain from the liquidation of an investment written off in interest expense interest expense for decreased to million  compared to million in the reduction in interest expense is due to the lower interest rate on our long term debt as a result of orbital s december refinancing transaction  which is discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million of debt extinguishment expenses associated with the repurchase of substantially all of our senior notes as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely due to lower effective state tax rates in our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum tax amt  were approximately and of pretax income in and  respectively  primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
as discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements associated with the adoption of fin net income our net income for was million  compared to million in  or and diluted net income per share  in and  respectively 
the increase in net income in was due to a million increase in pretax income  partially offset by a million increase in our income tax provision 
compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million in  a increase compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by million revenue growth in our satellites and space systems segment and million growth in our transportation management systems segment  offset partially by a million decrease in our launch vehicles segment and a million decrease in our advanced space programs segment 
the satellites and space systems segment growth was driven by significantly higher revenues in the communications satellites product line related to progress on several satellite contracts awarded in the transportation management systems segment growth was largely driven by work on several new contracts started in and early launch vehicles segment revenues decreased due to lower revenues from the interceptor launch vehicles and the target launch vehicles product lines  partially offset by higher revenues from the space launch vehicles product line 
advanced space programs segment revenues decreased due to a reduction in contract activity on a satellite that was launched in the second quarter of gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in  a increase compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in as compared to was due to a million  or  increase in our satellites and space systems segment  a million  or  increase in our advanced space programs systems segment  a million  or  increase in our transportation management systems segment and a million  or  increase in our launch vehicles segment 
the increase in gross profit in our satellites and space systems segment was principally due to higher revenues  driven by an increased level of contract activity in  and significantly improved contract profitability in the communications satellites product line resulting from net cost reductions and favorable contract adjustments 
gross profit in our advanced space programs segment increased despite lower revenues largely due to a favorable contract adjustment related to a satellite that was launched in the second quarter of the increase in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to the increase in revenues driven by growth in contract activity levels 
although launch vehicles revenues decreased  the segment s gross profit increased marginally due to the segment s overall operating margin improvement and cost growth on certain contracts in that did not recur in research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
our research and development expenses relate primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in compared to million  or of revenues  in the increase in research and development expenses primarily related to communications satellites and launch vehicle control systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expenses that were recorded in  as discussed below  along with increased bid  proposal and marketing expenses and higher professional fees 
bid  proposal and marketing expenses increased million primarily due to our pursuit of new programs in the satellites and space systems segment 
the increase in professional expenses was primarily due to million of fees incurred in connection with a review of stock based compensation grants and procedures that was completed in in  our stock based compensation expense increased to million  compared to million in  due to restricted stock units granted in and the majority of these costs are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses and the remainder are reported in cost of goods sold 
interest income and other interest income and other was million and million in and  respectively  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income increased primarily as a result of higher interest rates and higher short term invested cash balances 
other income in included a million gain from the liquidation of an investment written off in interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense in remained relatively consistent with interest expense in primarily as a result of our unchanged fixed rate debt balance during the majority of debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million of debt extinguishment expenses associated with the repurchase of substantially all of our senior notes as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
income taxes we recorded million and million of income tax expense in and  respectively  reflecting an annualized effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
the increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily related to higher state income tax expense 
our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to amt  were approximately of pretax income in and primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income 
net income our consolidated net income was million and million  or and diluted net income per share  in and  respectively 
the increase in net income in was due to a million increase in pretax income  partially offset by a million increase in our income tax provision 
segment results our products and services are grouped into four reportable business segments i launch vehicles  ii satellites and space systems  iii advanced space programs  and iv transportation management systems 
prior to  advanced space programs was aggregated and reported with satellites and space systems 
however  we determined to report advanced space programs on a stand alone basis in due to significant growth in new programs within the segment 
the segment information for and has been restated to conform to the presentation 
corporate office transactions that have not been attributed to a particular segment  as well as consolidating eliminations and adjustments  are reported in corporate and other 
the following table summarizes revenues and income from operations for our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles satellites and space systems advanced space programs transportation management systems corporate and other total income loss from operations launch vehicles satellites and space systems advanced space programs transportation management systems corporate and other total as adjusted in and to give retrospective effect to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement  as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues increased due to revenue increases in all three of the segment s product lines 
in our interceptor launch vehicles product line  which accounted for and of total launch vehicles segment revenues in and  respectively  we are developing and manufacturing the midcourse phase orbital boost vehicle obv  directed by the us missile defense agency mda and designed to defend the united states against long range ballistic missile attacks 
during  we conducted one obv interceptor launch as part of an mda flight test exercise and we delivered nine additional obv interceptors for deployment and continued test flights 
we are also developing the boost vehicle for the kinetic energy interceptor kei program  the next generation missile defense interceptor  under direction by mda 
revenues from the interceptor launch vehicles product line increased million primarily due to a ramp up of the development efforts on a demonstration vehicle test scheduled for late on the kei program  complemented by a marginal increase in obv program activity 
revenues increased million in the target launch vehicles product line resulting primarily from increased design and production activity on our ballistic missile target programs that support missile defense systems testing and on our coyote supersonic ramjet vehicle program for the us navy 
space launch vehicle product line revenues increased marginally due to higher levels of activity on taurus programs  partially offset by a reduction in pegasus and minotaur program activity 
operating income in the launch vehicles segment increased  due to operating profit increases in the interceptor and target launch vehicles product lines  partially offset by a decrease in the space launch vehicles product line operating profit 
interceptor launch vehicles operating income increased primarily due to the increase in the kei program due to increased program activity 
operating income from interceptor launch vehicles continued to be the largest contributor to this segment s operating income  with and of total segment operating income in and  respectively 
operating income from our target launch vehicles product line increased significantly in line with the revenue growth from our ballistic missile target programs and our coyote supersonic ramjet vehicle program 
operating income from space launch vehicles decreased primarily due to lower pegasus program activity and an unfavorable profit adjustment on a pegasus contract due to cost growth in  partially offset by higher taurus income consistent with higher program activity 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the margin decline was due to growth in the target launch vehicles product line  which had a lower than average margin for the segment  and due to lower margins in the space launch vehicles product line resulting from the unfavorable profit adjustment mentioned above 
satellites and space systems satellites and space systems segment revenues increased principally due to significant growth in communications satellites revenues partially offset by a reduction in science and technology satellite revenues 
communications satellites revenues accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
there were twelve commercial communications satellites in various stages of completion throughout as compared to eight in various stages of completion throughout revenues from the science and technology satellites product line declined largely due to certain programs completed or nearing completion in operating income in the satellites and space systems segment increased  primarily due to the growth in the communications satellites product line contract activity in this increase was partially offset by lower operating income from the science and technology satellites product line driven by the decline in program activity mentioned above in addition to an unfavorable profit adjustment resulting from cost growth on a contract 
communications satellites operating income accounted for and of total segment operating income in and  respectively 
the increase in communications satellites operating income was driven by the substantial growth in program activity as well as an improvement in this product line s profit margin in this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in this margin decrease is due primarily to a lower operating margin in our science and technology satellites product line that included the unfavorable profit adjustment discussed previously  offset partially by an improved operating margin in in our communications satellites product line 
advanced space programs advanced space programs segment revenues increased primarily due to increased contract activity on the orion human spacecraft program for nasa which began in late we are designing  developing and building the launch abort system las for the orion vehicle that will pull the spacecraft and its crew to safety in the event of an emergency on the launch pad or at any time during ascent 
the increase in orion program revenue was partially offset by a reduction in revenue due to the completion of an advanced satellite contract early in operating income in the advanced space programs segment increased primarily due to the substantial increase in contract activity on the orion program 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in this decrease in operating margin was primarily due to contract cost adjustments and a revised profit assessment in on the orion program 
transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues increased primarily due to an increase in product sales supporting existing public transit fleet management systems in addition to activity on recently awarded contracts 
operating income also increased primarily due to income contributed by higher product sales and increased program activity  offset partially by charges in to record the estimated costs to close out a contract that is expected to be completed in this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in  as compared to in  primarily due to higher profit margin on the product sales mentioned above 
corporate and other corporate and other revenues were comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues decreased primarily due to a million revenue decrease in our interceptor launch vehicles product line and a million revenue decrease in our target launch vehicles product line  partially offset by a million revenue increase in our space launch vehicles product line 
revenues from the interceptor launch vehicles product line decreased primarily due to a customer directed reduction in activity on our obv program  offset partially by increased activity on our kei program due to ramp up of the development efforts on a demonstration vehicle test scheduled for late interceptor launch vehicles accounted for and of total launch vehicles segment revenues in and  respectively 
target launch vehicle revenues decreased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in activity on certain target launch vehicle programs in  partially offset by higher revenue on the coyote supersonic ramjet vehicle program for the us navy due to transition from development into low rate initial production 
space launch vehicle revenues increased primarily due to higher levels of activity on taurus and minotaur programs offset by a reduction in pegasus program activity 
the taurus program ramped up in in anticipation of future launches  and in the second quarter of  we received and began work on an order for two minotaur vehicles 
pegasus program activity declined primarily due to customer directed delays in launch schedules 
operating income in the launch vehicles segment decreased for operating income from interceptor launch vehicles continued to be the largest contributor to this segment s operating income  with million and million of operating profit in and  respectively  or and  respectively  of total operating income in this segment 
the decrease in interceptor launch vehicle operating income was due to the previously mentioned reduction in revenues and program activity in this product line and to slightly lower contract fee accrual estimates in operating income from space launch vehicles increased consistent with the product line s revenue increase and improved cost performance on contracts 
operating income from our target launch vehicles product line increased marginally despite lower product line revenues  primarily due to cost growth that impacted several contracts in the launch vehicles segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues improved to in  compared to in this margin increase was due to improved space launch vehicles and target launch vehicles margins due to improved program performance resulting from higher incentive fees  cost control initiatives and continued implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
satellites and space systems satellites and space systems segment revenues increased primarily as a result of a million increase in communications satellites product line revenues related to substantial progress on several new satellite contracts awarded in communications satellites revenues accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
in addition  science and technology satellites product line revenues increased largely due to higher revenues on two science missions for nasa 
operating income in the satellites and space systems segment increased primarily due to the significant growth in revenues and contract activity in our communications satellites product line in addition to net cost reductions and favorable contract adjustments in in addition  operating income in our science and technology satellites product line increased largely due to higher contract activity on the nasa scientific missions 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues improved to in  compared to in this margin increase was primarily due to cost reductions and related operating performance improvements in the communications satellites product line 
advanced space programs advanced space programs segment revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in contract activity on a satellite that was launched in the second quarter of  offset partially by a revenue increase on the orion program for nasa that began in late operating income in the advanced space programs segment decreased primarily due to lower overall revenues in the segment  partially offset by a favorable contract adjustment related to a satellite that was launched in the second quarter of this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in  largely due to the favorable contract adjustment mentioned 
transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues increased in compared to largely driven by work on several new contracts started in and early three projects accounted for approximately million of revenue growth 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in revenues recognized on a project in singapore due to a reduction in activity as the contract was substantially completed at the end of operating income increased in compared to primarily due to the new contracts discussed above 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues improved to in  compared to in due to improved operating performance on contracts started in and early corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other loss from operations is comprised solely of transactions that have not been attributed to a particular segment 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities cash flow from operating activities in was million  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
despite the increase in revenue and net income  cash flow from operating activities remained constant compared to  primarily due to the increase in deferred revenues in  as described below  that did not recur in cash from operations in included an million net reduction due to changes in assets and liabilities  primarily due to an million increase in receivables  partially offset by an million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in receivables and payables was driven by the growth in contract activity and related revenues and costs in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities 
cash from operations in included a million favorable net change in assets and liabilities  primarily due to a million increase in deferred revenues  partially offset by a million increase in receivables 
the increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to cash received in advance of contract performance on certain communications satellite programs 
the increase in receivables was consistent with revenue growth in cash flow from investing activities in  we spent million for capital expenditures  as compared to million in  and we made net purchases of million of investments 
the nature and status of these investments are further discussed below in the section uncertainties in the credit markets 
in  we spent million for capital expenditures  as compared to million in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to additional integration and test equipment and an expansion of our satellite manufacturing facility 
cash flow from financing activities in  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
in  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million  including million shares repurchased in connection with the refinancing transaction discussed below 
in  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
during  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases  and warrant exercises in and in december we issued million of convertible notes payable as discussed in more detail below 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes  together with available cash  to repurchase million of our senior notes due for million and to repurchase and retire million outstanding shares of our common stock for million 
debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes were million  which is being amortized to interest expense over seven years 
convertible notes on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due with interest payable semi annually each january and july the convertible notes are convertible into cash  or a combination of cash and common stock at our election  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  in principal amount of the convertible notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share under certain circumstances 
at any time on or after january   the convertible notes are subject to redemption at our option  in whole or in part  for cash equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes  plus unpaid interest  if any  accrued to the redemption date 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to repurchase the convertible notes  in whole or in part  on january   january  or january   or  if a fundamental change as such term is defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes occurs  for cash equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes  plus any unpaid interest  if any  accrued to the redemption date 
credit facility in august  we entered into a five year million revolving secured credit facility the credit facility  with the option to increase the amount of the credit facility up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to be a lender for such additional amount 
the credit facility replaced our former million credit agreement  which was terminated in august loans under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to  with the applicable margin varying according to our total leverage ratio  or at our election  at a prime rate 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
up to million of the credit facility may be reserved for letters of credit 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility  although million of letters of credit were issued under the credit facility 
accordingly  as of december   million of the credit facility was available for borrowings 
debt covenants our credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  incur debt or liens  redeem or repurchase company stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  make investments  merge or consolidate with others or dispose of assets 
in addition  the credit facility contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
long term obligations the following table sets forth our long term obligations  excluding capital lease obligations in thousands december  convertible senior subordinated notes  interest due semi annually  principal due in january senior notes  interest due semi annually  principal due in july less current portion long term portion the fair value of our convertible notes at december  was estimated at approximately million  based on market trading activity 
uncertainties in the credit markets as of december   we had investments in auction rate securities with a total cost basis of million 
these investments are highly rated debt and preferred stock securities with nominal maturities of years or greater and are classified as available for sale securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
auction rate securities are normally structured to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  generally every days 
this mechanism allows existing investors either to roll over their holdings  whereby they will continue to own their respective securities  or liquidate their holdings by selling such securities at par 
since the third quarter of  these auctions have not had sufficient buyers to cover investors sell orders  resulting in unsuccessful auctions 
when an auction is unsuccessful  the interest rate paid on the investment is re set to a level predetermined by the security and remains in effect until the next auction date  at which time the process repeats 
as of december   our investments in auction rate securities were subject to auctions that have been unsuccessful 
while these investments are currently highly rated securities  it is uncertain if or when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve  and there is no assurance that the market for auction rate securities will stabilize 
as of december   our auction rate securities were written down from their cost of million to their estimated fair value of million  based on our analysis which included market information provided by the broker dealer of these securities and discounted cash flow analyses 
we recognized a temporary impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of that was recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  in conformity with sfas no 
in addition  we classified the auction rate securities as non current investments on our balance sheet 
we concluded that the impairment that occurred in was temporary because i we believe that the decline in market value that occurred in is due to general market conditions  ii the auction rate securities continue to be of high credit quality and interest is paid as due and iii we have the intent and ability to hold the auction rate securities until a recovery in market value occurs 
the fair value of these securities could change significantly in the future and we may be required to record additional temporary or other than temporary impairment charges if there are further reductions in fair value in future periods 
taurus ii development program we are engaged in a major new product development program to create a medium capacity rocket called taurus ii 
we believe that this new rocket could substantially expand our space launch vehicle market 
however  the taurus ii program entails a major development effort 
we currently anticipate that this effort will consume million to million of cash during before giving effect to cash receipts from any potential customer orders 
available cash and future funding at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
management currently believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our ability to borrow additional funds is limited by the terms of our credit facility 
additionally  significant unforeseen events such as termination of major orders or late delivery or failure of launch vehicle or satellite products could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
in may  we announced that our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock over a month period 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during we may purchase up to an additional million of our common stock pursuant to this repurchase program through may aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total our obligations under operating leases consist of minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office space and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of open purchase orders that we issued to acquire materials  parts or services in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposure is primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rate risk and the market value of certain investments that we hold as of december  we manage these market risks through our normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
uncertainties in the credit markets as of december   we had investments in auction rate securities with a total cost basis of million 
these investments are highly rated debt and preferred stock securities with nominal maturities of years or greater and are classified as available for sale securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
auction rate securities are normally structured to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  generally every days 
this mechanism allows existing investors either to roll over their holdings  whereby they will continue to own their respective securities  or liquidate their holdings by selling such securities at par 
since the third quarter of  these auctions have not had sufficient buyers to cover investors sell orders  resulting in unsuccessful auctions 
when an auction is unsuccessful  the interest rate paid on the investment is re set to a level predetermined by the security and remains in effect until the next auction date  at which time the process repeats 
as of december   our investments in auction rate securities were subject to auctions that have been unsuccessful 
while these investments are currently highly rated securities  it is uncertain if or when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve  and there can be no assurance that the market for auction rate securities will stabilize 
as of december   our auction rate securities were written down from their cost of million to their estimated fair value of million  based on our analysis which included market information provided by the broker dealer of these securities and discounted cash flow analyses 
we recognized a temporary impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of that was recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  in conformity with sfas no 
in addition  we classified the auction rate securities as non current investments on our balance sheet 
we concluded that the impairment that occurred in was temporary because i we believe that the decline in market value that occurred in is due to general market conditions  ii the auction rate securities continue to be of high credit quality and interest is paid as due and iii we have the intent and ability to hold the auction rate securities until a recovery in market value occurs 
the fair value of these securities could change significantly in the future and we may be required to record additional temporary or other than temporary impairment charges if there are further reductions in fair value in future periods 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we believe that the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates is not a substantial risk to us because the large majority of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars 
at december   we had million of receivables denominated in japanese yen and million denominated in singapore dollars 
from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations on receivables or expected payments denominated in foreign currency 
at december   we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business operations as a result of our ongoing investing and financing activities  which include debt as well as cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible notes is affected by our stock price 
the total estimated fair value of our convertible debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for our cash and cash equivalents is not significant 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
we assess our interest rate risks on a regular basis and do not currently use financial instruments to mitigate these risks 
deferred compensation plan we have an unfunded deferred compensation plan for senior managers and executive officers with a total liability balance of million at december  this liability is subject to fluctuation based upon the market value of the investment options selected by participants
