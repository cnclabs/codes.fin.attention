executive overview in  umpqua s results reflect the impact of the significant slowdown in the housing industry 
primarily affecting our northern california residential development portfolio  the impact of the slowdown resulted in non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets as of december   as compared to million or of total assets  as of december  net charge offs increased to million in  or of average loans and leases  as compared to  or of average loans and leases in the increase in non performing assets and net charge offs in contributed to a million provision for loan and lease losses in  as compared to million in umpqua holdings corporation however  the past year was not without some accomplishments 
during the year  we completed the acquisition and integration of north bay bancorp and its principal operating subsidiary  the vintage bank  along with its solano bank division in an all stock exchange valued at million with million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition 
increased gross loans and leases to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   respectively  a growth of million or 
the north bay acquisition accounted for million of the growth 
excluding the acquisition  the organic loan growth rate was for increased deposits to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   a growth of million or 
the north bay acquisition accounted for million of the growth 
the organic deposit growth rate excluding growth through acquisition was for increased total consolidated assets to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   an increase of million or 
the north bay acquisition accounted for million of the growth 
the organic asset growth rate excluding growth through acquisition was for issued million of new trust preferred securities  with a weighted average adjustable interest rate of month libor plus basis points  and redeemed existing trust preferred securities representing obligations of million 
repurchased million shares of stock at a weighted average price of per share 
declared cash dividends of per share in the third and fourth quarters of which was an increase of per share compared to the first and second quarters of opened two new stores in portland and one in bend  oregon 
also during the year net interest margin decreased to in from in the decrease in net interest margin resulted primarily from volatility in short term market interest rates and the competitive climate  characterized by increasing deposit costs combined with declining earning asset yields 
the decline in earning asset yields was partially due to the reversal of interest income during the year related to new non accrual loans 
we recorded an accrual for our estimated pro rata share of visa litigation related to visa s settlement with american express million pre tax and its ongoing litigation with discover million pre tax 
net income per diluted share was in  as compared to per diluted share earned in the interest income reversal due to new non accrual loans  provision for loan and lease losses and the visa litigation accrual contributed to the significant decline in net income per diluted share 
summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition 
allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality of the portfolio and the adherence to underwriting standards 
when loans and leases are originated  they are assigned a risk rating from to that is assessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process 
the risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank has a management alll committee  which is responsible for  among other things  regular review of the alll methodology  including loss factors  and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the alll committee reviews loans that have been placed on non accrual status and approves placing loans on impaired status 
the alll committee also approves removing loans that are no longer impaired from impairment and non accrual status 
the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology on a quarterly basis 
each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating 
credit loss factors may vary by region based on management s belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region 
regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired 
potentially impaired loans are referred to the alll committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the combination of the risk rating based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank may also maintain an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan and lease portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors 
this unallocated amount generally comprises less than of the allowance 
the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses  the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends 
the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the alll and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
management believes that the alll was adequate as of december  there is  however  no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the alll and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
there has been deterioration in the northern california residential development market which has led to an increase in non performing loans and allowance for loan and lease losses in the third and fourth quarters 
a continued deterioration in this market may lead to additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
mortgage servicing rights retained mortgage servicing rights are measured at quoted market prices 
subsequent measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when interest rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights 
umpqua holdings corporation upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 
on january   the company has elected to measure its residential mortgage servicing assets at fair value 
upon the change from the lower of cost or fair value accounting method to fair value accounting under sfas no 
 the calculation of amortization and the assessment of impairment were discontinued 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on a quarterly basis and determined that there was no impairment as of december  the valuation is determined using discounted cash flows of forecasted earnings  estimated sales price based on recent observable market transactions and market capitalization based on current stock price 
if impairment was deemed to exist  a write down of the asset would occur with a charge to earnings 
the impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology  and ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which among other things  requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in november  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings sab 
sab provides guidance on the accounting for written loan commitments recorded at fair value under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
specifically  the sab revises the staff s views on incorporating expected net future cash flows related to loan servicing activities in the fair value measurement of a written loan commitment 
sab  which supersedes sab  application of accounting principles to loan commitments  requires the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
sab is effective on january  for the company 
adoption of sab is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  a decrease of on a per diluted share basis compared to the decrease in net income in is principally attributable to increased provision for loan and lease losses and operating expenses  partially offset by increased net interest and non interest income 
we completed the acquisition of north bay bancorp on april   and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on april  for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis over the improvement in diluted earnings per share for was principally attributable to improved net interest income  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
we completed the acquisition of western sierra bancorp on june  and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on june  we incur significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of merger related expenses  net of tax 
we define operating income as income before merger related expenses  net of tax  and we calculate operating income per diluted share by dividing operating income by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per share see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating income and operating income per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income and operating income per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share for years ended december   and reconciliation of operating income to net income years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income per diluted share net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income the following table presents the returns on average assets  average shareholders equity and average tangible shareholders equity for the years ended december   and for each of the years presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income and operating income as shown in the table above 
our return on average umpqua holdings corporation shareholders equity is negatively impacted as a result of capital required to support goodwill 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible shareholders equity 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity less average intangible assets 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average shareholders equity 
returns on average assets  shareholders equity and tangible shareholders equity for the years ended december  in thousands returns on average assets net income operating income returns on average shareholders equity net income operating income returns on average tangible shareholders equity net income operating income calculation of average tangible shareholders equity average shareholders equity less average intangible assets average tangible shareholders equity net interest income net interest income is the largest source of our operating income 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million  or over net interest income for was million  an increase of million  or over the increase in net interest income in as compared to and as compared to is attributable to growth in outstanding average interest earning assets  primarily loans and leases  partially offset by both growth in interest bearing liabilities  primarily money market and time deposits  and a decrease in net interest margin 
in addition to organic growth  the north bay merger  which was completed on april   and the western sierra merger  which was completed on june   contributed to the increase in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in over and over the fair value of interest earning assets acquired as a result of the north bay merger totaled million  and interest bearing liabilities totaled million 
the fair value of interest earning assets acquired as a result of the western sierra merger totaled billion  and interest bearing liabilities totaled billion 
the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to the same period in the decrease in net interest margin in resulted from volatility in short term market rates and the competitive climate characterized by increasing deposit costs combined with declining interest earning asset yields  as well as interest reversals on new nonaccrual loans 
the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to this decrease is primarily due to increases in short term market rates which led to an increase in deposit and borrowing costs 
the increased yield on interest earning assets of basis points in  was more than offset by a corresponding increase in our cost of interest earning assets which increased by basis points in our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in volume  as well as changes in the yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds  or rates

provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses was million for  compared to million for as a percentage of average outstanding loans  the provision for loan losses recorded for was  an increase of basis points and basis points from and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in as compared to and is principally attributable to an increase in non performing loans and leases related primarily to the housing market downturn and its impact on our residential development portfolio  growth in the loan and lease portfolio and the increase in loans charged off in within the allowance for credit losses  the company has identified million of impairment reserve related to million of non accrual loans  which are specifically measured for impairment 
the net increase in impairment reserve  combined with downgrades within the portfolio related primarily to residential development  led to the million provision for loan and leases losses during the provision for loan losses is expected to cover subsequent charge offs on these non performing loans 
the provision for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of inherent risks in the loan portfolio and a corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
additional discussion on loan quality and the allowance for loan and lease losses is provided under the heading asset quality and non performing assets below 
non interest income non interest income in was million  an increase of million  or  over non interest income in was million  an increase of million  or  over the following table presents the key components of non interest income for years ended december   and non interest income years ended december  in thousands compared to compared to change amount change percent change amount change percent service charges on deposit accounts brokerage commissions and fees mortgage banking revenue  net net loss gain on sale of investment securities   nm other income total nm not meaningful the increase in deposit service charges in over is principally attributable to the increased volume of deposit accounts 
the increase in brokerage commissions and fees in over resulted from management s efforts to recruit new brokers  increase the weighting of managed fee sources and increase efficiencies in back room operations 
the increase in other income over was primarily related to a gain of million in resulting from the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures recorded at fair value and a  gain on sale of excess property 
additional information regarding the fair value election for the junior subordinated debentures is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in deposit service charges in over is principally attributable to the increased volume of deposit accounts as a result of the western sierra acquisition 
the decrease in brokerage commissions and fees in over resulted from the departure of certain strand investment advisors 
the remaining increase in other non interest income resulted primarily from increased revenue related to the western sierra acquisition 
non interest expense non interest expense for was million  an increase of million or compared to non interest expense for was million  an increase of million or compared to the following table presents the key elements of non interest expense for the years ended december   and umpqua holdings corporation non interest expense years ended december  in thousands compared to compared to change amount change percent change amount change percent salaries and employee benefits net occupancy and equipment communications marketing services supplies intangible amortization merger related expenses nm other total nm not meaningful the increase in non interest expense in over and over is primarily attributable to the inclusion of expenses from california operations as a result of the north bay and western sierra acquisitions 
salaries and employee benefits have continued to increase due to increased incentives  benefit costs  additional staff at new stores  and primarily the addition of approximately associates in april due to the north bay acquisition and approximately associates in june due to the western sierra acquisition 
net occupancy and equipment also continues to increase reflecting new banking locations as a result of the north bay acquisition in april  new banking locations as a result of western sierra acquisition in june and the addition of three de novo branches in and seven in the increase in services expense was primarily due to increased escrow accounting fees and higher consulting fees 
the increase in intangible amortization is due to the increase in core deposit and other intangibles as a result of the western sierra and north bay acquisitions 
other expenses in included a million charge for visa litigation 
in november  visa inc announced that it had reached a settlement with american express related to an antitrust lawsuit 
umpqua bank and other visa member banks are obligated to fund the settlement and share in losses resulting from this litigation 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a liability and corresponding expense of approximately million pre tax  for our proportionate share of that settlement 
in addition  visa notified us that it had established a contingency reserve related to unsettled litigation with discover card 
in connection with this contingency  we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a liability and corresponding expense of million pre tax  for our proportionate share of that contingent liability 
we are not a party to the visa litigation and our liability arises solely from the bank s membership interest in visa  inc previously  visa inc announced that it completed restructuring transactions in preparation for an initial public offering of its class a stock planned for early  and  as part of those transactions  umpqua bank s membership interest in visa was exchanged for class b stock of visa  inc in connection with visa s planned offering  it is expected that a portion of the class b shares will be redeemed for cash  with the remaining shares to be converted to class a shares three years after the offering or upon settlement of certain covered litigation  whichever is later 
visa is expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from the offering to fund the american express settlement and other litigation judgments or settlements that may occur 
in connection with the announced american express settlement  and in consideration of accounting guidance that we have been informed was provided by the securities and exchange commission  we currently anticipate that our proportionate share of the proceeds of the planned initial public offering by visa will more than offset any liabilities related to the visa litigation  and no cash payments from umpqua will be made in settlement of this liability 
we also incur significant expenses in connection with the completion and integration of bank acquisitions that are not capitalizable 
classification of expenses as merger related is done in accordance with the provisions of a board approved policy 
the decrease in merger related expenses in over and the increase in over is due to the difference in timing and size of the western sierra and north bay mergers 
the following table presents the merger related expenses by major category for the years ended december   and substantially all of the merger related expense for and were related to the north bay and western sierra acquisitions  respectively 
we do not expect to incur any additional merger related expenses in connection with the north bay  western sierra or any other previous merger 
merger related expense years ended december  in thousands professional fees compensation and relocation communications premises and equipment other total income taxes our consolidated effective tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income for was  compared to for and for the effective tax rates were below the federal statutory rate of and the apportioned state rate of net of the federal tax benefit principally because of non taxable income arising from bank owned life insurance  income on tax exempt investment securities  tax credits arising from low income housing investments  business energy tax credits and exemptions related to loans and hiring in designated enterprise zones 
additional information on income taxes is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
financial condition investment securities the composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
the investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements and collateral for certain public funds deposits 
trading securities consist of securities held in inventory by strand for sale to its clients and securities invested in trust for former employees of acquired institutions as required by agreements 
trading securities were million at december   as compared to million at december  this decrease is principally attributable to a decrease in strand s inventory of trading securities 
investment securities available for sale were billion as of december   as compared to million at december  this increase is principally attributable to the north bay acquisition million of investment securities as of the acquisition date and purchases of million of investment securities  partially offset by sales and maturities of million of investment securities available for sale and an increase in fair value of investment securities available for sale of million 
umpqua holdings corporation investment securities held to maturity were million as of december   as compared to million at december  this decrease is principally attributable to sales and maturities of investment securities held to maturity 
investment securities for each of the last three years are as follows summary of investment securities as of december  in thousands december  available for sale us treasury and agencies mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations obligations of states and political subdivisions other debt securities investments in mutual funds and other equity securities held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations other investment securities the following table presents information regarding the amortized cost  fair value  average yield and maturity structure of the investment portfolio at december  investment securities composition december  in thousands amortized cost fair value average yield us treasury and agencies one year or less one to five years obligations of states and political subdivisions one year or less one to five years five to ten years over ten years other debt securities one to five years over ten years serial maturities other investment securities total securities weighted average yields are stated on a federal tax equivalent basis of 
weighted average yields for available for sale investments have been calculated on an amortized cost basis 
the mortgage related securities in serial maturities in the table above include both pooled mortgage backed issues and high quality collaterized mortgage obligation structures  with an average duration of years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
equity securities in other investment securities in the table above at december  consisted principally of investments in two mutual funds comprised largely of mortgage related securities  although the funds may also invest in us government or agency securities  bank certificates of deposit insured by the fdic or repurchase agreements 
because the bank has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or to maturity  none of the investment securities are considered other than temporarily impaired 
additional information about the investment securities portfolio is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
loans and leases total loans and leases outstanding at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  from year end the growth in loans was due to the north bay acquisition million of loans as of the acquisition date and organic loan growth of million  or  primarily in the oregon washington region 
the bank provides a wide variety of credit services to its customers  including construction loans  commercial lines of credit  secured and unsecured commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  home equity credit lines  consumer loans and commercial leases

the bank s credit quality group is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
reviews of non performing  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is contained in part i item of this report in the section titled lending and credit functions 
non performing loans  which include non accrual loans and accruing loans past due over days totaled million or of total loans as of december   as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate other real estate owned  totaled million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets as of december  the increase in non performing assets in related primarily to the housing market downturn and its impact on our residential development portfolio 
loans are classified as non accrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful generally if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
additionally  all loans that are impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  are considered for non accrual status 
these loans will typically remain on non accrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain 
foreclosed properties held as other real estate owned are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or market value of the property less expected selling costs 
other real estate owned at december  totaled million and consisted of nine properties

substantially all of the restructured loans as of december  were classified as impaired 
no restructured loans were included as non accrual loans in the table above at december  and a decline in the economic conditions in our general market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that loans will not become days or more past due  become impaired or placed on non accrual status  restructured or transferred to other real estate owned in the future

allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan and lease losses alll totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as of december  is principally attributable to an increase in provision for loan and lease losses in excess of charge offs 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses allowance for loan and lease losses composition as of december  in thousands commercial real estate loans to individuals and overdrafts unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses the unallocated portion of alll provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not provided for in other components of alll analysis  and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
the increase in unallocated alll resulted from management s evaluation of existing general business and economic conditions  and declining credit quality and collateral value trends in the residential housing segment 
additionally the alll composition should not be interpreted as an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur 
the following table provides a summary of activity in the alll by major loan type for each of the five years ended december activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses years ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year loans charged off real estate commercial consumer and other total loans charged off recoveries real estate commercial consumer and other total recoveries net charge offs addition incident to mergers reclassification provision charged to operations balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs to average loans ratio of provision to average loans recoveries as a percentage of charge offs reflects amount of allowance related to unfunded commitments  which was reclassified during the third quarter of umpqua holdings corporation the significant increase in real estate loans charged off over previous years was due to significant slowdown in the housing industry which primarily affected our northern california residential development portfolio 
the following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc summary of reserve for unfunded commitments activity years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of year acquisition net decrease increase charged to other expenses balance  end of year we believe that the alll and ruc at december  are sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date  respectively  based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth  and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the alll and ruc cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the key elements of our mortgage servicing rights asset as of december   and summary of mortgage servicing rights years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of year additions for new mortgage servicing rights capitalized changes in fair value due to changes in model inputs or assumptions other amortization of servicing rights impairment charge balance  end of year balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans represents fair value as of december  and amortized cost as of december  and the fair value as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions  which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates 
represents changes due to collection realization of expected cash flows over time 
as of december   we serviced residential mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million for which servicing assets have been recorded 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the servicing asset recorded at the time of sale was amortized over the term of  and in proportion to  net servicing revenues 
subsequent to adoption  the mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking revenue 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans 
historically low market rates can cause prepayments to increase as a result of refinancing activity 
to the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
we have started hedging the fair value change of the msr portfolio starting in the fourth quarter of with a goal of minimizing the volatility to earnings 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at year end this increase in goodwill and other intangible assets is principally attributed to the north bay acquisition 
the goodwill recorded in connection with the north bay acquisition represented the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the value of north bay s core deposits  which included all deposits except certificates of deposit  and merchant servicing portfolio 
the value of the other intangible assets recorded in connection with the north bay acquisition was determined by a third party based on the net present value of future cash flows for the merchant servicing portfolio and an analysis of the cost differential between the core deposits and alternative funding sources for the core deposit intangible 
we amortize other intangible assets on an accelerated or straight line basis over an estimated ten to fifteen year life 
substantially all of the goodwill is associated with our community banking operations 
we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on a quarterly basis and there were no impairments recorded for the years ended december   or additional information regarding our accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets is included in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the growth in deposits was principally due to the north bay acquisition million of deposits as of the acquisition date 
organic deposit growth during was million organic growth  primarily in the oregon washington region 
management attributes this growth to ongoing business development and marketing efforts in our service markets 
information on average deposit balances and average rates paid is included under the net interest income section of this report 
additional information regarding deposits is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the following table presents the deposit balances by major category as of december deposits as of december  in thousands amount percentage amount percentage non interest bearing interest bearing demand savings and money market time   or greater time  less than  total umpqua holdings corporation the following table presents the deposit balances by region as of december deposits by region in thousands amount mix amount mix deposits by region oregon washington california total deposits core deposits oregon washington california total core deposits of total deposits core deposits are defined as total deposits less time deposits greater than  the following table presents the scheduled maturities of time deposits of  and greater as of december  maturities of time deposits of  and greater in thousands three months or less three months to six months six months to one year over one year total borrowings at december   the bank had outstanding million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and million of federal funds purchased 
additional information regarding securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased is provided in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
at december   the bank had outstanding term debt of million 
advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb amounted to million of the total and are secured by investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging from to and million  or  mature prior to december   while another million  or  mature prior to december  management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding 
additional information regarding term debt is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  and umpqua early adopted sfas no 
and selected the fair value measurement option for certain junior subordinated debentures not acquired through acquisitions and new junior subordinated debentures issued in at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over libor 
although any increases in short term market interest rates will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
all of the debentures issued to the trusts  less the common stock of the trusts  qualified as tier capital as of december   under guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
additional information regarding the terms of the junior subordinated debentures  including maturity redemption dates  interest rates and the adoption of sfas no 
 is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 
the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling billion at december  the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling million at december  availability of the lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility 
these lines are intended to support short term liquidity needs  and the agreements may restrict the consecutive day usage 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
in  the bank paid the company million in dividends to fund regular operations 
the bank also paid the company million in special dividends in to fund share repurchases 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to fund its quarterly cash dividend distributions to shareholders and meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the principal source of cash provided by operating activities was net income 
net cash of million used in investing activities consisted principally of million of net loan growth and purchases of million of investment securities available for sale  partially offset by sales and maturities of investment securities of million  cash acquired in the north bay merger  net of cash consideration paid  of million and proceeds on sales of other real estate owned of million 
the million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million of net deposit increases  million in proceeds on issuance of junior subordinated debentures and million increase in fed funds purchased  partially offset by financing outflows related to stock repurchases of million  dividends payment of million  and repayment of million of junior subordinated debentures and million of term loans 
off balance sheet arrangements information regarding off balance sheet arrangements is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
umpqua holdings corporation the following table presents a summary of significant contractual obligations extending beyond one year as of december  and maturing as indicated future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than year to years to years more than years total term debt junior subordinated debentures operating leases  net of subleases other long term liabilities total contractual obligations include maximum payments related to employee benefit plans  assuming all future vesting conditions are met 
additional information about employee benefit plans is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the table above does not include deposit liabilities  interest payments or purchase accounting adjustments related to term debt or junior subordinated debentures 
although we expect the bank s and the company s liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during  there is significant competition for bank deposits 
it is possible that our deposit growth for may not be maintained at previous levels due to increased pricing pressure or  in order to generate deposit growth  our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits 
concentrations of credit risk information regarding concentrations of credit risk is included in notes   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources shareholders equity at december  was billion  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase in shareholders equity during was principally due to the issuance of shares in connection with the north bay acquisition valued at million  shares issued in connection with stock plans and related tax benefit of million  and retention of million  or approximately  of net income for the year  partially offset by stock repurchases of million 
the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
our consolidated tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was million at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies 
our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s regulatory capital category 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
during the third and fourth quarter of  umpqua s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate to from per share  which was the rate paid  in the first and second quarters of this increase was made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of  among other things  earnings  regulatory capital levels and expected asset growth 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the supervision and regulation section of part i of this report 
there is no assurance that future cash dividends will be declared or increased 
the following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios dividends declared per share divided by basic earnings per share for the years ended december   and cash dividends and payout ratios dividend declared per share dividend payout ratio on april   the company announced that the board of directors approved an expansion of the common stock repurchase plan  increasing the repurchase limit to million shares and extending the plan s expiration date from june  to june  as of december   a total of million shares remained available for repurchase 
there were no shares repurchased in open market transactions during the fourth quarter of the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon the market price for our common stock  securities laws restricting repurchases  asset growth  earnings and our capital plan 
in addition  our stock plans provide that option and award holders may pay for the exercise price and tax withholdings in part or whole by tendering previously held shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet umpqua holdings corporation growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  interest sensitivity gap in thousands by repricing interval non rate sensitive total months months years over years assets temporary investments trading account assets securities available for sale securities held to maturity loans and loans held for sale non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal funds purchased term debt junior subordinated debentures non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet of december for each respective year 
interest rate simulation impact on net interest income as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points as of december   we believe our balance sheet was in an asset sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income and a decrease in market interest rates would have negative effect on net interest income 
the flattening yield curve and changed mix and pricing characteristics of our balance sheet in resulted in decreased asset sensitivity from the previous years 
at december   we were liability sensitive in three of four scenarios 
however  our overall sensitivity in all four scenarios has decreased as compared to prior years indicating a more neutral interest risk position 
as of december   we believe our balance sheet was in a liability sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income and a decrease in market interest rates would have positive effect on net interest income 
some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected  in the actual level of market interest rates or competitive influences on our deposit base 
a second interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
umpqua holdings corporation the table below illustrates the effects of various market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in estimated fair value of equity percentage change increase decrease in estimated fair value of equity percentage change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points consistent with the results in the interest rate simulation impact on net interest income  our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes has increased as compared to impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
