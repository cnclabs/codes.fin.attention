business overview we are a leading provider of medical devices for the minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux disease  a progressive condition caused by incompetent vein valves in the legs 
venous reflux disease results in symptoms such as leg pain  swelling  fatigue  skin ulcers and painful varicose veins 
our primary product line  the closure system  consists of a proprietary rf generator and proprietary disposable endovenous catheters and devices to close diseased veins through the application of temperature controlled rf energy 
we estimate that in excess of  patients have been treated using our closure system since in the first quarter of  we fully launched our closurerfs family of products  which can be used for perforator vein ablation 
in february  we began the market introduction of our closurefast catheter 
we believe that this is a significant advancement of the closure procedure in the field of minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux 
since our inception in january  we have focused on the development of minimally invasive treatments for venous reflux disease 
until  our operations consisted primarily of start up activities  including the development of our closure system  recruiting personnel and raising capital 
we launched commercial sales of our closure system in europe in late and in the united states in late for the year ended december   we generated net revenues of million and net loss of million 
as of december   we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
from inception to september  we were not profitable 
we were profitable beginning in the last quarter of through we incurred net losses in and through the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we were profitable 
we incurred a net loss for the fiscal year ended we market our closure system through a direct sales organization in the united states and france and subsidiaries in germany and the united kingdom 
we also market and sell our products through distributors throughout the world 
most of our us customers are reimbursed by governmental and third party payors  and that reimbursement is subject to periodic review and adjustment 
currently  our closure procedure is covered by the policies of approximately health insurers  representing over million covered lives in the united states 
our net revenues are derived from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessory products  which comprised  and of our net revenues  respectively  in at the end of april  we completed a software upgrade that was promoted in the third quarter of that enabled our rf generator to function with all vnus disposable catheters and devices for the treatment of venous reflux  including the closurefast catheter released during the first quarter of the delivery of the software upgrade in march and april of allowed us to recognize million of revenue primarily during the first two quarters of  which had been previously deferred beginning in august 
table of contents we manufacture  package and label our disposable endovenous catheters and devices and outsource the manufacture of our rf generators and accessory packs 
we have a diverse customer base of hospitals  physicians and physician groups  with no single customer accounting for or more of our net revenues or accounts receivable in the years ended december   and financial operations overview net revenues 
we derive our net revenues from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessory products 
our large installed base of rf generators facilitates a recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable catheters 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues represents the cost of materials  overhead  direct labor and delivery charges associated with the manufacture of disposable catheters  the purchase and delivery of rf generators  the purchase and delivery of accessory products  warranty  inventory reserves and share based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing personnel compensation  sales force incentive compensation  travel  promotional materials  advertising  patient education materials  other expenses incurred to provide reimbursement services  clinical training and share based compensation 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  supplies  materials and other expenses associated with product development  expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and share based compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for accounting  human resources  information technology and corporate administration  professional fees and share based compensation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition 
we sell our disposable catheters rf generators to end users in the united states and in international markets 
catheters and rf generators are also sold through distributors in international markets 
we also sell rf generators to third party leasing companies in the united states 
these third party leasing companies provide long term lease financing to end users 
we do not provide such long term lease financing to end users 
we recognize revenues from the sale of our products in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for an arrangement with multiple deliverables  we recognize revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables with revenues allocated among the different elements  and in accordance with eitf no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
where software is more than incidental to the product or the arrangement  the company recognizes revenues for those products in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 
table of contents software revenue recognition with respect to certain agreements 
the company recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  collection of the related receivable is probable 
where software is incidental to the product or arrangement  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of those products in accordance with sab no 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
in order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our domestic and international return policy allows customers to return unused products for a period of and days  respectively  subject to restocking fees 
we make provisions for estimated returns and allowances based on historical levels 
to date  returns and allowances have been insignificant 
if actual returns and allowances were to deviate significantly from our estimates  our revenues could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in first out basis 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based upon historical demand and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the current cost of the inventory and estimated market value and is charged to the provision for inventory obsolescence  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
at the point of recognition of the loss  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology  we could be required to increase our inventory allowance and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
warranty 
at the time we recognize revenues  we establish a reserve for estimated warranty expense associated with revenues  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
we offer a one year limited warranty on our rf generator which is included in the sales price of the generator 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the number of units sold  historical and anticipated cost per claim and rates of warranty claims 
we primarily estimate material costs based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
our service agreement with our rf generator manufacturer provides us with a warranty on the generators for the shorter of months from the date of shipment to us or months from the date of first use 
as such  our warranty expense is only required to cover those expenses not covered by our service agreement 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty reserves are made for specific technical problems 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if costs of servicing warranty claims are greater than the expectations on which the reserve has been based  our gross profit could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance based on the aging of account balances  collection history  credit quality of the customer and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we maintain a diverse customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 
additionally  if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income 
table of contents taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes  and historical operating losses 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
share based compensation expense 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas no 
r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

years ended december  change change dollars in thousands net revenues net revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to the following increased catheter sales in both units and dollars due to increased demand for the closurefast catheter  offset by a lower average sales price  increased rf generator sales in both units and dollars  primarily due to international expansion and recognition of million in deferred revenue relating to the software upgrade promoted at the end of with delivery commencing at the end of the first quarter  and increased accessory sales in both dollars and units 

table of contents net revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to the following increased unit sales of catheters and generators partially offset by reduced average sales price for both and the deferral of million of generator sales due to the undelivered software upgrade  and increased accessory sales coupled with the limited launch of the closurerfs product line 
we expect net revenues to continue to increase in as a result of continued market acceptance of our closurefast catheter in both domestic and international markets 
net revenues by product the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues derived from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessories for the years ended december   and years ended december  catheters and devices rf generators accessories we derive our net revenues from the sale of disposable endovenous catheters and devices  rf generators and accessory products 
our large installed base of rf generators facilitates a recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable catheters 
we manufacture  package and label our disposable endovenous catheters and devices and outsource the manufacture of our rf generators and accessory products 
we have several competitors selling a laser based alternative to our closure system  and we believe that competitive pressures have increased modestly over the last twelve months 
we believe that the reasons for the increased competitive pressures include pricing and the number of competitors in the market 
we expect that the competitive pressures on our business will continue for the foreseeable future 
net revenues by geographic region as a percentage of net revenues the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues from domestic and international sales for the years ended december    and years ended december  united states europe other we market our closure system through a direct sales organization in the united states and france and subsidiaries in germany and the united kingdom 
we also market and sell our products through distributors throughout the world 
in  we experienced an increase in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from sources outside the us  primarily due to the addition of a direct sales presence in the united kingdom in we expect our net revenues derived from sales outside the united states to increase in primarily related to international expansion 

table of contents gross profit by period the following table sets forth our gross profit for the fiscal years ending  and  and the percentage change between periods years ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin for was approximately compared with approximately for and for the overall decrease in gross profit margin in compared to was primarily due to lower margin of closurefast catheters  which were introduced by the company in the first quarter of  as compared to closureplus catheters  due to initial manufacturing inefficiencies associated with launching a new product  and increases in inventory reserves primarily related to inventory balances on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
the overall decrease in gross profit margin in compared to was primarily due to lower sales of higher margin rf generators  due in part to the deferral of million of rf generators sales in related to the software upgrade promoted at the end of and delivered in  increases in manufacturing overhead in due to costs of our new facility  and increases in compensation costs in related to the adoption of sfas no

the changes in interest income and other  net  in as compared to  were primarily the result of a decrease of  in interest and other income primarily related to lower cash and short term investment balances and declining interest rates  partially offset by an increase of  in currency related transaction gains primarily due to the weakening dollar against the euro and the british pound 

table of contents interest income and other  net  increased by million in as compared to  primarily due to an increase of million in interest and other income  and an increase of  in currency related transaction gains 
we expect interest income and other net to increase in primarily due to anticipated increased cash and short term investments balances as a result of anticipated increases in sales 
provision for income taxes we have significant net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards 
the  and  provisions for income taxes in and  respectively  primarily represent the estimated foreign and state income taxes payable which could not be offset by nol and tax credit carryforwards 
we expect to use nol and other tax carryforward amounts to the extent taxable income is earned in the future 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million and state nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal nol carryforwards expire in various periods from through and the state nol carry forwards expire in various periods from through we have federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits expire in various periods through and the state research credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
we also have federal and state amt credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the amt credits carry forward indefinitely 
the amounts of and the benefits from nol and credit carryforwards may be impaired in some circumstances 
events that may cause such limitations include  but are not limited to  sale of equity securities and other changes in ownership 
we have historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes 
therefore  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nol and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at december  we will retain a full valuation allowance until such time that we determine it is more likely than not that we will recognize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
prior to the release of the valuation allowance  to the extent that we are profitable  our effective tax rate should continue to be substantially less than the applicable statutory rates 
following the release of our valuation allowance  our effective tax rate will approximate the applicable statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources december  change change cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities we incurred net losses from inception through december  of million 
we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in several money market funds consisting of debt instruments of the us government  its agencies and high quality corporate issuers with original maturities of less than three months 
investments designated as short term consist of cash invested in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year and commercial paper 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock  and cash generated from operations 
in addition  we raised 
table of contents approximately million  net of issuance costs  from our initial public offering of common stock in october cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities increased million in as compared to primarily due to an increase of million in inventories  as the company continues to build inventory in response to increased customer demand  an increase of million in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales offset by improved customer collections  a decrease of million in deferred revenue primarily due to deferral of rf generators sales in relating to the software upgrade promoted at the end of  but not delivered until  and a decrease of  in deferred share based compensation  partially offset by an increase of million in accrued compensation and benefits

net cash used in investing activities decreased by million in as compared to  primarily due to an increase of million in cash used to purchase of short term investments  an increase of million in proceeds from the sale of short term investments  and an increase of million from the purchase of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million in as compared to primarily due to an increase of million in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and an increase of  in the amount of employee payroll taxes withheld and paid on behalf of employees related to the release of restricted stock units on a net issuance basis 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

table of contents other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources we expect that sales and marketing and research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in connection with the growth of our business 
we expect to fund these increased costs and expenditures from our cash flows from operations and our existing cash balance 
however  our future capital requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
the costs associated with expanding our manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  patent litigation  the costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our products and products in development  the effects of competing technological and market developments  and the costs associated with being a public company 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and cash we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may require additional funds in order to further develop the marketplace  complete clinical studies and deliver new products to our customers 
we may seek financing of future cash needs through the sale of equity securities and debt 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our business operations or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity or debt securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  contractual obligations and capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations and less than more than capital expenditure requirements total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations inventory purchase commitments other purchase commitments total on march   we entered into a lease termination agreement termination agreement  effective as of march  with the landlord of our former office space at zanker road in san jose  california the lease 
the lease expired on june  we paid approximately  in march and were not required to pay any further rent and other charges owed under the lease after the effective date of the termination agreement 
we received  the full amount of our security deposit previously paid under the lease plus interest  less amounts due for march rent through the termination date and other amounts to which landlord was entitled to apply the security deposit pursuant to the terms of the lease in march 
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  substantially all of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
approximately of sales revenue for was denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  we believe that there is currently no material exposure of our sales revenue to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while our reporting currency is the us dollar  a portion of our assets primarily deposit accounts are denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and foreign currencies 
if a foreign currency depreciates against the us dollar  the value of a portion of our earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the impact of an aggregate decline of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position would not be material 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers via several money market funds 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is currently no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
additionally  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows
