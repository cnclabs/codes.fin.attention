item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statement this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of some of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  intends  plans  estimates  projects  strategy  or anticipates  or the negative of those words or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements  including those factors described in risk factors under item a in this form k 
some factors include changes in governmental  legislative and environmental restrictions  catastrophic losses from fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  insect infestations or diseases  as well as changes in economic conditions and competition in our domestic and export markets and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contemplated by our projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted results as reflected in forward looking statements relating to our operations and business include  but are not limited to the failure to meet our expectations with respect to our likely future performance  an unanticipated reduction in the demand for timber products and or an unanticipated increase in supply of timber products  an unanticipated reduction in demand for higher and better use timberlands or non strategic timberlands  our failure to make strategic acquisitions or to integrate any such acquisitions effectively or  conversely  our failure to make strategic divestitures  and our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
it is likely that if one or more of the risks materializes  or if one or more assumptions prove to be incorrect  the current expectations of plum creek and its management will not be realized 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made  and neither plum creek nor its management undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
overview operating performance compared to operating income decreased by million to million in our results reflect the weakness in us residential construction markets  which had the fewest new housing starts since operating income from our manufactured products segment decreased by million to million 
this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber and plywood prices 
we were also negatively impacted by higher mdf raw material costs  which further reduced operating margins 
weak demand from lumber and plywood mills caused operating income for both of our timber segments to decline 
operating income in our northern resources segment decreased by million to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower sawlog prices and a planned reduction in harvest levels 
operating income in our southern resources segment decreased by million to million due primarily to a combination of weaker sawlog prices and a decline in the diameter of sawlogs we sold 
operating income from our real estate segment increased by million to million 
excluding operating income from a large  non strategic timberland sale in wisconsin  operating income increased by million 
this increase was due primarily to selling more acres higher and better use recreational and small non strategic properties in plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item during  we received settlement payments of million million net of tax from the canadian softwood lumber dispute 
this one time gain was included in operating income 
our earnings were also negatively impacted by higher interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was due primarily to increased borrowings to fund the repurchase of common stock and timberland acquisitions 
key economic factors impacting our timber and manufactured products business our operating performance for the timber and manufactured products segments is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
selected us housing economic data was as follows at december us housing starts in millions supply of existing homes for sale in months year fixed interest mortgage rates average housing starts of million in and million in were above demographic demand levels 
the home construction boom was caused by low interest rates  easy credit terms and rising home prices 
the home construction business has slowed significantly 
housing starts for were only million and are expected to decline further in to lows not seen since the recession 
the decline is being further driven by falling home prices in most areas  increased number of homes in foreclosure  higher standards to qualify for home loans  increased supply of homes for sale and the slowing us economy 
it is expected that it will take a year or two before there is a rebound in home construction 
the significant decline in home construction has resulted in an excess supply of lumber and other building products 
this excess supply has resulted in weak lumber and plywood prices 
furthermore  the decline in home construction has caused mills to curtail production which has caused downward pressure on sawlog prices 
in addition  our joint venture partners have slowed the development of our projects due to current adverse market conditions 
our timber and manufacturing operations are also negatively impacted by rising fuel prices 
operating margins in our timber business were negatively affected by million  million and million in  and  respectively  when compared to the prior year due to rising fuel costs and longer hauling distances 
as a result of the recent rise in the price of oil  timber operating margins could be reduced further in real estate sales and development properties we estimate that included in the company s approximately million acres of timberlands are about million acres of higher value timberlands which are expected to be sold and or developed over the next years for recreational  conservation or residential purposes 
included within the million acres of higher value timberlands are approximately million acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and approximately  acres that may be developed by our real estate development business 
our real estate development business is conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
in addition  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next five years 
additionally  during we sold  acres of timberlands in wisconsin  and we may sell other large blocks of timberlands in the future to maximize value 
plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item during  we sold approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  approximately  acres for conservation purposes and approximately  acres of higher and better use recreational properties 
we expect to sell up to  acres of higher and better use recreational acres in  whereas we estimate the number of small non strategic acres sold will decline modestly 
sales are expected to remain at these levels in future years 
during our average price per acre for higher and better use recreational properties and non strategic timberlands is likely to be lower than the price per acre we realized during primarily due to a change in the quality of the sales mix 
also  despite the significant decline in housing starts  prices for most of our higher and better use recreational properties  which are comprised primarily of rural timberlands  have generally remained strong 
however  due to the slowing us economy and reduced availability of loans to finance purchases  demand for our rural timberlands could weaken 
our land development business continued to evolve during we have identified  acres an estimated properties that we expect to develop internally over the next years 
at december   we had internal development properties entitled and an additional in the planning process 
revenue from sales of development properties was million during  which included revenue of million from the sale of several parcels that were in the planning process 
we are continuing to build a portfolio of internal development projects we can bring to the market 
we expect to generate revenues of between million and million during and estimate the revenue from the development business to grow modestly in future years 
our development business is conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
additionally  we have identified  acres that we expect to develop through joint ventures 
we have entered into six joint venture arrangements covering approximately  acres 
we do not expect significant revenues from these joint venture arrangements for several years 
we are the minority partner in each of these joint ventures  and our involvement is limited to selling and or contributing land and exercising certain protective rights 
we expect to enter into additional joint venture arrangements during harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood product mix included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during we expect harvest levels during to range between and million tons 
the expected decline in harvest levels in is due primarily to the temporary increase in harvest levels during and to take advantage of favorable pulpwood demand 
future harvest levels may vary from historic levels due to weak markets  to take advantage of favorable prices or due to factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by our sale of timberlands and the extent to which proceeds are reinvested in core timberlands 
plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition for timber sales timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
we sell timber under delivered log agreements and through sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut sales contracts  timber deed sales and lump sum sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  we harvest the timber and deliver it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  we incur the cost of logging and hauling 
pay as cut sales contracts 
pay as cut sales contracts are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases  an advance is received in connection with pay as cut sales contracts 
in other cases  the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut sales contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the timber is harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut sales contract is the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the unit price for each type of tree 
timber deeds 
timber deed sales are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
unlike a pay as cut sales contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer also pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is the amount of the highest bid and is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
lump sum sale agreements 
under a lump sum sale agreement  the buyer and seller agree to a total lump sum price for all the timber available for harvest on a tract of land 
generally  the lump sum price is paid when the contract is signed 
title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer as the timber is harvested 
lump sum sales are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise 
under a lump sum sale  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
total revenue recognized under a lump sum sale contract usually to months is the amount of the highest bid  and is not dependent upon the volume or type of trees actually harvested 
unlike timber deed sales  revenue is recognized under a lump sum sale agreement as the timber is cut 
we estimate the amount of revenue to recognize each month based on actual harvested volume compared to the total volume available for harvest according to the timber cruise 
we generally receive weekly information from the buyer reporting how much volume has been harvested 
additionally  we gather information by observing the tract to estimate the timber volume harvested 
in most cases  the total volume harvested from a tract of land is different than plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item the volume estimated in the timber cruise 
if the total volume harvested is greater than the cruise estimated volume  we will stop recognizing revenue once the total revenue recognized is equal to the total lump sum contract price 
no revenue will be recognized for volumes harvested in excess of the cruise estimated volume 
if the total volume removed is less than the cruise estimated volume  an adjustment will be recorded in the month in which we learn of the difference 
the adjustment is an increase in revenue equal to the difference between the total revenue recognized to date and the total lump sum contract price 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales timber deed sales lump sum sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  approximately of our timber sales in and of our timber sales in consisted of pay as cut sales contracts  timber deed sales or lump sum sales 
since under pay as cut sales contracts  timber deed sales and lump sum sales the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs  the operating profit as a percentage of revenue is typically higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales we estimate that included in the company s approximately million acres of timberlands are about million acres of higher value timberlands  which are expected to be sold and or developed over the next years for recreational  conservation  or residential purposes 
included within the million acres of higher value timberlands are approximately million acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and approximately  acres that may be developed by our real estate development business 
our real estate development business is conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
in addition  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next five years 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the number of properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
we estimate our real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage could range from to of revenues 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  the sale of conservation easements will have an operating profit percentage of close to because no book basis is allocated to this type of revenue 
sales of recently acquired properties will generally have relatively lower operating profit percentages while sales of properties held for a long time will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages 
sales of timberlands owned by plum creek prior to the timber company merger  which  for accounting purposes  were deemed acquired as of the merger date  will thus have lower operating profit percentages since these properties were recorded at appraised value as of october plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item in connection with major timberland acquisitions  we are generally not able to identify our future real estate sales 
however  while our purchase price allocation and related appraisals reflected greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future for uses which have a higher value than timber production  we are generally not able to identify specific properties 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all the acres acquired  except when we can specifically identify properties 
in general  however  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations and specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions  and generally  when we acquire properties  we do not have the ability  with any level of precision  to estimate which of the acquired properties will someday sell for more than their underlying timber production value 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our ability to recover the net investment in long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in a business when the carrying value net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
when the fair values of the assets are not available  we estimate the fair values by using the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the assets 
the cash flows are discounted at the risk free rates of interest 
future cash flow estimates are based on probability weighted projections for a range of possible outcomes 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of the assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
we have grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years 
the purchase price of these acquisitions has been allocated to our timber and timberlands including assets held for sale and real estate development properties and property  plant and equipment 
the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination is highly subjective 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  these assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
we track cash flows for our million acres of timberlands by grouping them into eight geographic areas in the northern resources segment and eight geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  we track cash flows for each of our ten manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
sfas no 
provides that for assets used in a business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
we use one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
because of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in our timber business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
sfas no 
provides that an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of those assets exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during  the above criteria were met by a number of our timberland properties  and we recognized impairment losses of million 
similarly  we recognized impairment losses of million in and million in in connection with timberlands held for sale see note of the notes to financial statements 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange non strategic timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial investors  and it is probable that we will recognize  in accordance with sfas no 
 additional impairment losses in the future in connection with sales of non strategic timberlands 
in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management has concluded that it is probable ie  likely that timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently being actively marketed  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and estimate the price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are being actively marketed and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management has concluded it is likely the property will be sold within twelve months based on its best estimate of fair value 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our ten manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs and availability  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
the availability of logs in close proximity to our mills has been declining and is expected to decline further in the future 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for our ten manufacturing facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to remain weak at current levels for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines more than expected  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for one or more of its manufacturing facilities in a future period 
capitalized real estate development costs 
current and future costs associated with specific real estate development projects are capitalized once management has concluded it is probable that a project will be successful 
real estate development costs are expensed as incurred when management is not able to conclude that it is probable a project will be successful 
furthermore  previously capitalized costs for specific projects are written off when management revises its prior assessment and concludes that it is probable a project will not be successful 
for many of our projects  there is less judgment in making this determination due to prior experience in the local market or advice from consultants 
however  for some of our larger projects where we have limited experience in the local market or for projects in environmentally sensitive areas  there is significant judgment in assessing the expected outcome for the projects 
at december   we have million of capitalized costs associated with projects that management expects will be successful 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment a southern resources segment total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment b southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment southern resources segment c estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment southern resources segment sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for a increase in estimated future silviculture costs d northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume e northern resources segment southern resources segment a depletion expense for includes a million loss  representing the book basis of timber volume destroyed as a result of fires on  acres in montana 
b depletion rate increased due primarily to our and oregon acquisitions and annual evaluation of our standing timber inventory 
c reflects an increase in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to higher chemical and application costs 
d assumes future timber volumes do not change 
e assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item weather patterns  inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
we have invested in technology that enables us to predict our current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised at least annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
deferred income taxes plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code 
a reit is generally not subject to corporate level income tax if it distributes of its taxable income to shareholders and satisfies other organizational and operational requirements as set forth in the internal revenue code 
if a company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
as a consequence of the october  merger with the timber company  which involved merging a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level tax built in gains tax if the company makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the merger within the ten year period following the merger date 
the built in gains tax applies to gains from such asset sales to the extent that the fair value of the property exceeds its tax basis at the merger date 
built in gains tax is generally not payable on dispositions of property to the extent the proceeds from such dispositions are reinvested in qualifying like kind replacement property 
the built in gains tax does not apply to income generated from the harvesting and sale of timber 
in connection with our merger with the timber company  plum creek wrote off all of the timber company s deferred income tax liability related to timber and timberlands except for million 
the million deferred income tax liability related to the book tax basis difference of timber and timberlands that were expected to be sold  and subject to  the built in gains tax during the ten year period ending october  during the period october  to december   the million deferred income tax liability was reduced by million due to the payment of tax in connection with sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  plum creek remeasures the amount of deferred income taxes needed in connection with expected sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax each quarterly reporting period 
in  plum creek reduced our deferred tax liability associated with timber and timberlands by million and correspondingly recorded a deferred tax benefit of million 
based on projected timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax for the period january  to october   and plum creek s ability to successfully reinvest proceeds in like kind properties  it is estimated plum creek needs a deferred tax liability of approximately million 
as a result  no adjustment to the deferred tax liability associated with the built in gains tax was made in or it is likely that actual timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax over the ten year period will be greater than  or less than  our current projection 
an adjustment to earnings will be required in the period in which it is determined that timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax will be greater than  or less than  our current projection 
accounting for share based compensation plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  value management awards and dividend equivalents 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
grants of both value management awards and dividend equivalents represent awards that are classified and accounted for as liabilities under sfas no 
r 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period for both value management awards and dividend equivalents will equal the fair value ie  cash value of an award as of the last day of the performance period multiplied by the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  sfas no 
r requires the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period to be based on the fair value of value management awards and dividend equivalents as of the end of the most recent quarter 
prior to the end of the performance period  compensation costs for value management awards and dividend equivalents are based on the awards most recent quarterly fair values and the number of months of service rendered during the performance period 
fair values for value management awards and dividend equivalents are computed based on our historical relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of peer groups consisting of forest products companies  the s p index and the morgan stanley reit index over the same period peer group 
the simulated total shareholder return of the company and the peer groups is computed using a monte carlo simulation 
the key assumptions used in the simulation of the company s and the peer group s total shareholder return are volatility  beta the measure of how plum creek s stock moves relative to the market as a whole  risk free interest rate  and expected dividend yield 
additionally  the fair value of dividend equivalents assumes that our current quarterly dividend of the company s common stock of per share will remain constant through the end of the performance period 
the fair value of the liability for outstanding value management awards and dividend equivalents at december  was million  which is based on the current fair value of outstanding awards multiplied by the percentage of months services that were provided during the performance period 
the liability at december  could range between million and million based on the possible fair value of all outstanding liability based awards 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we could have a material adjustment to our share based compensation liability to the extent there is a material change in the fair value of our value management awards and dividend equivalents during the quarter 
pensions plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and two supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits vest after three years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
participants who were employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance formula or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on the highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits to hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
it is the company s policy to fund the qualified pension plan annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued 
there was no funding of the qualified plan during because as of december   the fair value of plan assets of million exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of million by million 
assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors and  therefore  are not considered plan plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item assets 
it is the company s policy to fund the non qualified pension plans annually such that the fair value of the assets held in the grantor trust equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation 
there was no funding to the non qualified plans grantor trust during because as of december   the fair value of the assets held by the grantor trust of million exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation of million by million 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rate a rate of compensation increase c assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets b rate of compensation increase c a the december   discount rate was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  b the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
c the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation reflected in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets

events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to almost million acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
our actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels will be impacted by sales of timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
harvest levels in the northern resources segment were approximately million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during we expect harvest levels in the northern resources segment in to decrease between and from with an estimated mix of sawlogs and pulpwood 
this decrease in harvest levels is due primarily to the temporary increase in harvest levels during and to take advantage of favorable log prices 
harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during in  we expect harvest levels in the southern resources segment to decrease between and from with an estimated mix of sawlogs and pulpwood 
this decrease in harvest levels is due primarily to the temporary increase in pulpwood harvests during and to take advantage of favorable pulpwood prices and increased thinnings of our timberlands to improve growth rates 
us canada softwood lumber agreement historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
in  the softwood lumber agreement sla was signed by the us and canada establishing a system of tiered taxes and or volume restrictions that will be in effect for a period of seven years 
generally  the sla provides that no import restrictions would be imposed on canadian lumber shipments to the us when the published composite price for lumber is higher than per thousand board feet 
below that level  a system of tiered export tax and or volume restrictions would be triggered 
the impact of the taxes could be mitigated by fluctuations in the rate of exchange between us and canadian dollars 
during  us officials alleged canada has not collected all taxes due and has allowed more lumber exports to the us than provided for under the sla 
under the terms of the sla  disputes that cannot be settled are resolved by binding arbitration 
a final ruling has not been issued by the arbitrator in this dispute 
in  the us filed a second arbitration case alleging that certain canadian provinces have provided subsidies to their lumber industries  in violation of the sla 
a request by the us for arbitration is currently pending 
notwithstanding the signing of the sla between the us and canadian governments and the results of matters being or expected to be arbitrated  there can be no assurance it will effectively create a fair trade environment 
therefore  downward pressure on domestic timber and lumber prices caused by canadian imports could continue or increase

table of contents part ii item comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue both the acquisition and divestiture of timberlands to increase the value of our assets 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located primarily in oregon and georgia 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located primarily in oregon 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located in northern michigan  arkansas and florida 
we sold approximately  acres of timberlands in   in and  acres in as a result of these timberland acquisitions and dispositions  our ownership was approximately million acres at december  and approximately million acres at both december  and accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of timberland acquisitions and divestitures 
results of operations the following table compares operating income loss by segment for the years ended december in millions operating income by segment northern resources southern resources real estate manufactured products other total segment operating income other costs and eliminations gain from canadian lumber settlement other operating income expense  net operating income compared to northern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower harvest volumes million and lower sawlog prices million 
harvest volume was million tons during compared to million tons in this decrease of primarily sawlogs was due primarily to a temporary increase in harvest levels during to take advantage of favorable log prices 
sawlog prices were lower compared to the prior year due primarily to mill curtailments as a result of weak lumber prices caused by the significant decline in housing starts 
northern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for  and for this decrease was due primarily to lower sawlog prices and lower harvest levels 
segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in the decrease was due primarily to lower log and haul costs as a result of a decline in harvest levels  offset in part by a fire loss million and an increase in log and haul rates per ton million 
the fire loss represents the book basis of the timber volume destroyed by fires on approximately  acres in montana 
the increase in log and haul rates per ton was due primarily to longer hauling distances 
southern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber million and higher pulpwood prices million  offset in part by lower sawlog prices million and a lower margin mix from log sales million 
harvest volumes were approximately million tons for both and plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item revenues increased million due to the company s increased percentage of delivered log sales 
a portion of the increase in delivered log sales results from decreasing the percentage of standing timber sales 
under delivered log sale agreements  we are responsible for log and haul costs 
conversely  the buyer incurs the log and haul costs when standing timber is sold 
we sell logs on a delivered basis when  in our judgment  log merchandising efforts will yield a net premium over selling standing timber 
while revenues are higher under a delivered log sale  a large portion of that increase is to cover the related increase in cost of sales 
as a result  for delivered log sales we realize lower operating income as a percentage of revenue  even though operating income is generally improved 
sawlog prices during were lower than during the lower prices are due primarily to mill curtailments as a result of weak lumber and plywood prices caused by the significant decline in housing starts and a greater proportion of smaller diameter logs 
approximately one half of the sawlog price variance  or million  is due to smaller diameter logs 
the increase in smaller logs is due primarily to the increase in thinning of pine plantations as a proportion of our total pine harvests  and this trend is expected to continue 
pulpwood prices increased by due primarily to lower sawmill residual woodchips as a result of mill curtailments and weather related harvesting restrictions 
as a result of improving pulpwood prices and weak sawlog prices  we increased the percentage of pulpwood harvested and decreased the percentage of sawlogs harvested  which resulted in an overall lower margin mix from log sales 
southern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for  and for this decrease was due primarily to lower sawlog prices  a lower margin mix from log sales and a higher proportion of delivered log sales 
segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in the increase was due primarily to a higher percentage of delivered log sales

this increase is due primarily to an increase in the number of acres of higher and better use recreational and small non strategic land sales million  offset in part by lower average prices from higher and better use recreational and small non strategic land sales million  no conservation easement sales million and lower revenues from sales of development properties million 
in december  we sold  large non strategic acres in wisconsin for million 
the number of acres of higher and better use recreational properties sold during increased by and the number of acres of small non strategic properties sold during increased by compared to these increases were due primarily to a plan to expand the number of acres we sold in both of these categories during plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item our average sales price per acre for higher and better use recreational lands decreased approximately during due primarily to sales mix 
during  we increased our sales in states with lower per acre prices while sales remained stable in states with higher per acre prices 
during  competition increased in the states with the highest per acre prices and demand softened 
our average sales price per acre for small non strategic properties declined approximately during due primarily to selling a mix of less valuable timberlands during during  we sold a greater percentage of properties from higher value regions 
our remaining inventory of small non strategic acres do not have as great of a percentage of high value properties as our sales mix during additionally  the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the number of properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding 
also  in any period the sales average will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of the parcels sold 
development properties revenue in includes million from the sale of several parcels that were in the planning process to two developers in georgia 
development properties revenue during includes the sale of a large development project for proceeds of million 
this large development project  which the company had been working on for several years  consisted of approximately  acres of land in king county  washington 
see part i  item business  real estate segment for a summary of internal development properties and joint venture arrangements 
we expect revenues from real estate sales during to range between million and million of which million to million is from development properties 
we estimate we will sell up to  acres 
these sales will consist of up to  acres of higher and better use recreational properties  up to  acres of development properties and the remainder from small non strategic and conservation sales 
in addition to the above acres  from time to time  we may sell large blocks of other timberlands to maximize value 
the real estate segment operating income as a percent of revenue was for the period ended december   compared to for the same period in real estate segment costs and expenses increased by million to million in this increase was due primarily to costs associated with our large  non strategic land sale in wisconsin during million and selling more acres during  offset in part by lower costs associated with our development business 
costs associated with our development business were million for compared to million in  with approximately half of the development business costs in associated with the large project sold in king county  washington 
manufactured products segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber prices million  lower lumber sales volume million and lower plywood prices million  offset in part by higher mdf prices million 
lumber prices during were lower than during due primarily to weak demand and excess supply 
the demand for lumber has declined due primarily to significantly lower housing starts 
us housing starts peaked in at million units and since then have been on a steady decline 
housing starts for were million compared to million units in  a decrease of 
the lower housing starts are due in part to an excess supply of unsold homes on the market  with a current ten month supply compared to an historical average supply of six months 
the excess supply is expected to continue for at least the next twelve months due to falling home prices  record high foreclosure rates  stricter borrowing terms from lenders and a slowing us economy 
in response to the decline in housing starts  north american lumber production has also been declining 
the supply of lumber in the united states decreased by during the first nine months of compared to the same period in the prior year 
despite the decline in north american lumber production  there still remains an excess supply of lumber at current demand levels 
lumber sales volume decreased by due primarily to production curtailments as a result of a fire related log shortage in montana and weak lumber markets 
plum creek k 
table of contents part ii item plywood prices during were lower than during due primarily to increased competition from commodity plywood manufacturers 
commodity plywood prices have experienced downward pressure due to lower oriented strand board a substitute for commodity plywood prices as a result of fewer housing starts 
the lower commodity plywood prices have caused several plywood manufacturers to target the industrial markets we serve 
mdf prices during were higher than during due primarily to north american production curtailments 
despite weakening demand due to falling housing starts  the supply of north american mdf has declined faster due to weak operating margins and reduced imports 
mdf operating margins have been compressed due to the significant increase in raw material costs  and mdf imports have declined as a result of the weak us dollar 
manufactured products segment operating income was less than of its revenues for  and of its revenues for this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber and plywood prices and higher mdf raw materials costs 
manufactured products segment costs and expenses decreased by million to million for this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber sales volume and raw material costs  offset in part by higher mdf raw material costs 
mdf raw material costs increased by million as a result of higher wood chip due to a regional shortage from lower lumber production and resin costs 
other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead and intercompany profit elimination decreased operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in this increase of million was due primarily to higher share based compensation expense million and increased costs associated with information technology million and strategic business development million 
the increase in share based compensation expense is due primarily to an increase in the fair value of our value management plan awards in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment  we adjust the fair value of our liability associated with our value management plan quarterly based on our relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of several peer groups 
gain from canadian lumber settlement 
in  a definitive agreement was signed between the us and canadian governments to settle the long standing dispute over canadian lumber imports
