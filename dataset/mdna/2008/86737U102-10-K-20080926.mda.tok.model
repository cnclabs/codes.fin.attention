item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

index to financial statements the following table sets forth the percentage of patient days from various payors in sunlink s healthcare facilities for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended june  source medicare medicaid private and other sources total the following table sets forth the percentage of the net patient revenues from various payors in sunlink s hospitals 
fiscal years ended june  source medicare medicaid private and other sources total hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the extent to which ancillary services and therapy programs are ordered by physicians and provided to patients  and the volume of outpatient procedures 
reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of service eg  acute care  intensive care or psychiatric care and the geographic location of the hospital 
the percentage of patient revenues attributable to outpatient services has increased in recent years  primarily as a result of medical technology advances that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis and from increased pressures from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
we believe that our experience with respect to increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the healthcare industry 
patients generally are not responsible for any difference between established hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurer plans  health maintenance organizations hmos or preferred provider organizations ppos  but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has been increasing in recent years 
collection of amounts due from individuals typically is more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicaid is a federal state program  administered by the states  that provides hospital and nursing home benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
all of sunlink s hospitals are certified as healthcare services providers for persons covered by medicare and medicaid programs 
amounts received under the medicare and medicaid programs generally are significantly less than the established charges of most hospitals  including our own  for the services provided 
see item business government reimbursement programs medicare medicaid reimbursement 
quality assurance each sunlink hospital implements quality assurance procedures to monitor the level and quality of care provided to its patients 
each hospital has a medical director who supervises and is responsible for the quality of 
index to financial statements medical care provided and a medical advisory committee comprised of physicians who review the professional credentials of physicians applying for medical staff privileges at the hospital 
the medical advisory committee also reviews and monitors surgical outcomes along with procedures performed and the quality of the logistical  medical and technological support provided to the physicians 
each hospital periodically conducts surveys of its patients  either during their stay at the hospital or subsequently by mail  to identify potential areas of improvement 
each sunlink hospital  except the leased hospital in dexter  missouri  is accredited by the joint commission of accreditation of healthcare organizations  also known as jcaho 
competition among the factors which we believe influence patient selection among hospitals in our markets are the appearance and functionality of the healthcare facilities  the quality and demeanor of professional staff and physicians  and the participation of the hospital in plans which pay a portion of the patient s bill 
such factors are influenced heavily by the quality and scope of medical services  strength of referral networks  hospital location and the price of hospital services 
although our hospitals may face less competition in their immediate patient service areas than would be expected in larger communities  since they are the primary provider of healthcare services in their respective communities  our hospitals nevertheless face competition from larger tertiary care centers and  in some cases  other rural  exurban  suburban or  in limited circumstances  urban hospitals  some of which particularly large urban hospitals offer more specialized services 
the competing hospitals may be owned by governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions and may be able to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis 
such governmental owned and not for profit hospitals  as well as various for profit hospitals operating in the broader service area  likely have greater access to financial resources than do sunlink hospitals 
managed care and efforts to control healthcare costs each sunlink hospital is affected by its ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services 
health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services through managed care programs and to obtain discounts from hospitals established charges 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are seeking to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers on the basis of market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of medical staff  convenience and price 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market  depending on the market strength of such organizations 
management believes that  on an industry basis  managed care contracts generally are less important in rural and exurban markets than in urban and suburban markets where there is typically a higher level of managed care penetration 
nevertheless  a significant portion of hospital patients in rural and exurban communities are covered by managed care or other reimbursement programs  all of which generally pay less than established charges for hospital services 
the healthcare industry as a whole faces the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while managing rising costs  facing strong competition for patients  and adjusting to a general reduction of reimbursement rates by both private and government payors 
both private and government payors continually seek to reduce the nature and scope of services which may be reimbursed 
healthcare reform at both the federal and state level generally is designed to reduce reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations  and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payors  may require changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  rates and or services in the future 

index to financial statements the hospital industry  including all of sunlink s hospitals  continues to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and average inpatient occupancy rates continue to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization  utilization review  and payment mechanisms designed to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients and to limit the cost of treating inpatients 
admissions constraints  payor pressures  and increased competition are likely to continue 
historically we have responded to such trends by adding and expanding outpatient services  upgrading facilities and equipment  offering new programs and adding or expanding certain inpatient and ancillary services 
currently we expect to continue to respond to such trends in a similar manner subject to the availability of capital resources  and our evaluation of the continued utility of such historical responses 
government reimbursement programs a significant portion of sunlink s healthcare facilities net revenues is dependent upon reimbursement from medicare and medicaid 
although the federal government generally reviews payment rates under its various programs annually  changes in reimbursement rates under such programs  including medicare and medicaid  generally occur based on the fiscal year of the federal government which currently begins on october and ends on september of each year 
medicare inpatient reimbursement the medicare program pays hospitals under the provisions of a prospective payment system for inpatient services 
under the inpatient prospective payment system  a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment  known as diagnosis related group drg 
each patient admitted for care is assigned to a drg based upon his or her primary admitting diagnosis 
every drg is assigned a payment rate by the government based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
drg payments do not consider a specific hospital s costs  but are national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case mix indices 
drg rates are usually adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year 
the percentage increases to drg payment rates for the last several years have been lower than the percentage increases in the related cost of goods and services provided by general hospitals 
the index used to adjust the drg payment rates is based on a price statistic  known as the cms market basket index  reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors 
drg rate increases were     and for federal fiscal years     and respectively 
the balanced budget act of originally set the increase in drg payment rates for future federal fiscal years at rates that are based on the market basket index  which in certain years have been  and in the future may be  subject to reduction factors 
the medicare  medicaid and health benefits improvement and protection act of bipa amended the balanced budget act of by giving hospitals a market basket increases minus in fiscal year for federal fiscal year and thereafter  hospitals received the full market basket rate increase 
bipa also made a number of changes to medicare and medicaid affecting payments to hospitals 
all of our acute care hospitals qualify for some relief under bipa 
some of the changes made by bipa that affect our hospitals include the lowering of the threshold by which hospitals qualify as rural disproportionate share hospitals  a decrease in reductions in payments to disproportionate share hospitals that had been mandated by the balanced budget act of and other congressional enactments  an increase in inpatient payments to hospitals  an increase in certain medicare payments to certain psychiatric hospitals and units  an increase in medicare reimbursement for bad debts  capping medicare beneficiary ambulatory service co payment amounts  and 
index to financial statements an increase in the categories and items eligible for increased reimbursement to hospitals for certain outpatient services rendered on and after april  which increase includes items such as current cancer therapy drugs  biologicals  and certain medical devices 
if the update factor does not adequately reflect increases in sunlink s cost of providing inpatient services  our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
in november  congress enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma 
mma requires hospitals to report specified quality data in order to receive full market basket rate increase on drgs 
hospitals that do not report this information will receive the market basket percentage increase less percentage points 
on february  the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of dra 
the dra provides that  beginning with the payment update for the federal fiscal year beginning october  and each subsequent federal fiscal year  the annual percentage increase amount will be reduced by percentage points for specified hospitals that do not submit certain quality data 
in addition  the dra required that cms begin to expand the starter set of quality measures that have been used since for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system ipps for the federal fiscal year beginning and after october   cms added new measures to the reporting hospital quality data for annual payment update rhqdapu program to bring the total to measures for such federal fiscal year and for the federal fiscal years beginning october  all of sunlink s hospitals are currently reporting the quality data and therefore receiving the full market basket rate increase 
section c of the dra required hhs to implement rules pursuant to which hospitals must report the secondary diagnoses that are present on the admission poa of patients 
by october   hhs was required to select at least two conditions that are high cost or high volume or both  assigned to a higher paying drg when present as a secondary diagnosis  and reasonably preventable through application of evidence based guidelines 
beginning october   cases with the selected conditions would not be assigned to a higher paying drg unless they were present on admission 
currently cms has selected nine conditions which are subject to such provisions 
mma made a number of significant changes to the medicare program  including a number of provisions designed to help strengthen and preserve access to medical care in rural areas by providing higher medicare payments to small rural hospitals 
in addition to a highly publicized prescription drug benefit that is intended to provide direct relief to medicare beneficiaries  mma provides a number of direct benefits to hospitals  including  but not limited to incorporation of the permanent single base payment or standardized amount for hospitals  resulting in increased payments for hospitals located in rural and small urban areas 
a permanent increase in the base payment rate for rural and small urban hospitals of up to the large urban payment rate  an increase in the cap on disproportionate share payments for rural and small urban hospitals  which  as of april   was increased to of total inpatient payments  extended indefinitely the hold harmless provisions for small rural hospitals and sole community hospitals under the outpatient department reform provisions of the mma these payment provisions are intended to ensure that small rural hospitals are paid at least as much under the outpatient prospective payment system as they would have received under the cost based payment methodology in effect before august  and establishment of a physician incentive program for primary care and certain specialty physicians who provide services to individuals in areas having the fewest physicians available to serve medicare beneficiaries  among others 
each of sunlink s hospitals is an eligible hospital under one or more provisions of mma 

index to financial statements each year  on or about august  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms issue a final rule that implements changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system ipps for subsequent federal fiscal years 
the august  final rule expanded previously implemented changes that according to cms take significant steps to improve the accuracy of medicare s payment for inpatient stays 
the payment reforms  which are being phased in over time  align hospital payments more closely with the costs of a patient s care by using hospital costs rather than charges  and by accounting more fully for the severity of the patient s condition 
the revised payments became effective for discharges on or after october  the august  final rule adopted pursuant to mma made further changes designed to continue to improve the accuracy of medicare s payment under the acute care ipps 
the ipps payment reforms are designed to restructure the inpatient diagnosis related groups drgs to account more fully for the severity of each patient s condition 
in addition  the rule includes important provisions intended to ensure that medicare no longer pays for the additional costs of certain preventable conditions including certain infections acquired in the hospital 
the rule also reduces medicare payments when a hospital replaces a device that is supplied to the hospital at no or reduced cost 
it is estimated that payments to all hospitals increased by an average of percent for the federal fiscal year beginning october  when all provisions of the rule took effect  primarily as a result of a percent market basket increase 
payments to specific hospitals may increase more or less than the average depending on the patient mix of the specific hospital 
for instance  urban hospitals generally treat more severely ill patients and are estimated to receive a percent increase in payments 
the rule created new severity adjusted drgs to replace the previous drgs 
projected aggregate spending will not change as a result of the reforms 
however  payments will increase for hospitals serving more severely ill patients and decrease for those serving patients who are less severely ill 
the effect of the change in drgs to our hospitals is unknown and depends on the acuity of services provided to future patients 
the rule also implemented a provision of the dra that takes the first steps toward preventing medicare from giving hospitals higher payment for the additional costs of treating a patient who acquires a condition including an infection during a hospital stay 
already the feature of many state health care programs  the dra requires hospitals  effective as of october   to begin reporting secondary diagnoses that are present on the admission of patients  beginning with discharges on or after such date 
beginning on october   cases with these conditions are no longer paid at a higher rate unless these symptoms were present on admission 
in order to improve the reliability of care in the nation s hospitals  the rule identifies eight conditions  including three serious preventable events sometimes called never events that meet the statutory criteria 
the effect of the future implementation of this dra provision to our hospitals is not known 
prior to july   long term care psychiatric units within hospitals were exempt from the prospective payment system  and were reimbursed under the provisions of a cost based system  subject to specific reimbursement caps 
during a three year transition period beginning on july  such units were partially reimbursed based on a prospective payment system based on patient acuity with the remaining portion of the payment continuing to be reimbursed based on a cost based system 
under the transition period for the implementation of this new prospective system was was reimbursed under the pps system for the year ending june   and was reimbursed under the pps system for the year ending june  and was reimbursed under the pps system for the year ending june  since july   long term care psychiatric units are being reimbursed solely based on the federal inpatient psychiatric prospective payment rate 
sunlink operates one psychiatric unit in one of its hospitals and believes this change will have a minimal effect on sunlink s consolidated revenues 

index to financial statements medicare outpatient reimbursement most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system 
this outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of ambulatory payment classifications apc 
each apc is designed to represent a bundle of outpatient services  and each apc is assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate 
medicare pays a set price or rate for each apc group  regardless of the actual cost incurred in providing care 
each apc rate generally is subject to adjustment each year by an update factor based on a market basket of services index 
for calendar years     and the update factor were     and respectively 
if the update factor does not adequately reflect increases in sunlink s cost of providing outpatient services  our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
on november  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms issued a final rule updating the hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps  effective for services furnished during calendar year cy  which encourages higher quality and accessible health care through new payment policies and the reporting of quality measures 
the final rule with comment period also updated the payment rates for the revised ambulatory surgical center asc payment system  beginning in cy according to cms the policies of the revised asc payment system that are reflected in the payment rates further expand beneficiary choices by providing patients the flexibility to select  in consultation with their physicians  the most appropriate care setting for their particular surgical needs  the revised system takes a major step toward eliminating financial incentives for choosing one care setting over another  thereby placing patients needs first  increasing efficiencies  and leading to savings for both beneficiaries and the medicare program 
in this final rule  cms also adopted the use of composite apcs to encourage efficiencies by providing one bundled payment for several major services 
according to cms composite apcs encourage even greater hospital efficiencies than expanding packaging by making a single payment for the totality of hospital outpatient care provided during an encounter 
medicare disproportionate share payments in addition to the standard drg payment  the social security act requires that additional medicare payments be made to hospitals with a disproportionate share of low income patients 
bipa provisions  effective for services provided on and after april   stipulate that rural facilities with fewer than beds with a disproportionate share percentage greater than will be classified as a disproportionate share hospital entitled to receive a supplemental disproportionate share payment based on gross drg payments 
since april   the effective rate has been of drg payments 
all of our hospitals were classified as disproportionate share hospitals at june  we estimate that medicare disproportionate share payments represented approximately of our net patient service revenues for the years ended june   and recovery audit contractors in  cms began using recovery audit contractors racs to detect medicare overpayments not identified through existing claims review mechanisms 
the rac program relies on private auditing firms to examine medicare claims filed by healthcare providers 
fees to the racs are paid on a contingency basis 
the rac program began as a demonstration project in three states new york  california and florida  but was made permanent by the tax relief and health care act of cms plans to expand the rac program to additional states beginning in and to have racs in place in all states by racs perform post discharge audits of medical records to identify medicare overpayments resulting from incorrect payment amounts  non covered services  incorrectly coded services  and duplicate services 
cms has given racs the authority to look back at claims up to three years old  provided that the claim was paid on or after october  claims identified as overpayments will be subject to the medicare appeals process 

index to financial statements racs are paid a contingency fee based on the overpayments they identify and collect 
we expect that the racs will look closely at claims submitted by our facilities in an attempt to identify possible overpayments 
although we believe the claims for reimbursement submitted to the medicare program are accurate  we cannot predict whether we will be subject to rac audits in the future  or if audited  what the result of such audits might be 
medicaid in patient and out patient reimbursement each state operates a medicaid program funded jointly by the state and the federal government 
federal law governs the general management of the medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources 
as a result  each state medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria 
in the recent past the various states in which sunlink operates hospitals initiated increased efforts to reduce medicaid assistance payments 
these efforts and reductions have been triggered by an increased effort by cms to decrease the federal share of payments for medicaid beneficiaries as well as by the significant increases in program utilization resulting from increased enrollment and from budgetary cuts facing states where sunlink operates 
in particular  georgia  where sunlink operates three hospitals  has begun initiatives to decrease the medicaid funds paid to providers 
georgia historically  the state of georgia has reimbursed medicaid providers for inpatient services in a manner similar to the medicare prospective payment system in that hospitals received a fixed fee for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment  known as drgs 
these medicaid drg payments do not consider a specific hospital s costs  but are statewide rates adjusted for each hospital s capital cost allotment 
medicaid outpatient services are reimbursed with interim rates based on a facility specific cost to charge ratio 
these interim payments are then adjusted subsequent to the end of the cost reporting period to an amount equal to of the costs associated with providing care to the medicaid outpatient population 
beginning in georgia s fiscal year ended june   georgia implemented a medicaid hmo program and awarded contracts to private companies for the management and processing of certain medicaid claims 
the intent of the medicaid hmo program is to curtail utilization and reduce rates paid by the state of georgia 
all of sunlink s facilities that operate in the state of georgia have secured contracts with all the hmo companies contracted by the state 
since the implementation of the medicaid hmo program  all sunlink hospitals receive reimbursement from three different contractors instead of a single source prior to the implementation 
while the amounts of the inpatient payments have not changed since the contractors utilize the same payment rates  the timing of the receipt of the payments has changed due to the multiple payors 
for outpatient services  the sunlink hospitals have contracts the three hmo vendors and services are reimbursed of the current interim rate determined by the georgia department of community health government reimbursement program administration and adjustments the medicare  medicaid and champus tricare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to facilities 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 

index to financial statements annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to sunlink under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due 
providers also have rights of appeal and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of prior years cost reports 
although the final outcome of these audits and the nature and amounts of any adjustments are difficult to predict  we believe that we have made adequate provisions in our financial statements for adjustments that may result from these audits and that final resolution of any contested issues should not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
until final adjustment  however  significant issues may remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or greater than ultimately required 
if sunlink or any of our facilities were found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or similar programs  sunlink could be subject to substantial monetary fines  civil penalties and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
speciality pharmacy operations our specialty pharmacy segment is operated through sunlink scriptsrx  llc of which carmichael s cashway pharmacy  inc is currently the sole operating subsidiary and is a pharmacy operations segment is composed of four material service lines specialty pharmacy services  which services may overlap somewhat with our home health care services by virtue of common methods of delivery  generally in a non hospital setting but which are not presently conducted in any of our healthcare facilities markets and ordinarily include one or more of the following elements the provision of products relating to infusion therapy  enteral feeding services  oncology and chemotherapy drug administration  cardiac  diabetes  pain management  wound care  and psychiatric services 
pharmaceutical or biological products administered via non oral means  which are frequently through injectable or infusion therapies  products delivered to the patients via express package or hand delivery and requiring special handling such as constant refrigeration or having an extremely limited shelf life  products that generally are administered in a non hospital setting  including the physician office  specialty clinic or patients home 
the provision of pharmaceuticals or biological not managed under the traditional outpatient prescription drug benefit  and therapies that require complex care  patient education and continuous monitoring 
the major conditions these drugs treat include  but are not limited to cancer  hiv aids  hemophilia  hepatitis c  multiple sclerosis  infertility  crohn s disease  rheumatoid arthritis  and growth hormone deficiency 
institutional pharmacy services  consisting of the provision of specialty and non specialty pharmaceuticals and biological products to institutional clients or to patients in institutional settings such as nursing homes  hospices  and correctional facilities  durable medical equipment  consisting primarily of products for patient administered home care such as oxygen concentrators  liquid oxygen systems  continuous positive airway pressure or cpap machines  nebulizers  diabetes management products and prosthetics  retail pharmacy products and services  consisting primarily of walk in sales at our three distribution facilities in louisiana of complementary products including non specialty pharmaceuticals  vitamins  
index to financial statements supplements and nutritionals 
we view our retail sales operations as a source of incremental revenue to us while providing value added service to our patients in the form of full service pharmacy offerings 
government reimbursement programs as previously noted  in  congress passed the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  also known as the medicare modernization act mma 
regulations implementing the mandates under the mma reduced the reimbursement for healthcare providers in urban areas for a number of products and services provided by our pharmacy operations and established a competitive bidding program for certain durable medical equipment provided under medicare part b in urban areas 
competitive bidding is intended to further reduce reimbursement for certain products and will likely decrease the number of companies permitted to serve medicare beneficiaries in the competitive bidding areas cbas 
the centers for medicare medicaid services cms had planned to implement the competitive biding program for medicare durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics  and supplies dmepos products and services with the goal of offering beneficiaries access to quality with lower out of pocket costs 
the program has  however  been deferred indefinitely  and whether or not the program is implemented in the future is unknown 
we were exempted under the deficit reduction act of from the proposed competitive acquisition program for dmepos  but we cannot be sure such exemption would continue to be available in the future or that the program will be implemented in the future as it was originally designed 
loss of the exemption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation 
the mma also created a new medicare prescription drug benefit beginning in and  more immediately  a prescription drug card program 
on january   the cms issued final rules implementing the portions of the mma relating to the new prescription drug benefit 
in addition to these new programs  the mma also made changes affecting payments for drugs under medicare s existing benefits 
section c of the mma revised the payment methodology for part b covered drugs that are not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis 
in particular  section c of the mma amended title xviii of the act by adding section a  which moved from a system based on average wholesale price or awp to one based on a new average sales price asp drug payment system 
since january   drugs and biologicals not paid on a cost or prospective payment basis are paid based on the asp methodology 
principal among these latter changes was a modification in the method of calculating reimbursements for certain oncology  renal dialysis  and other drugs 
there are exceptions to this general rule which are listed in the latest asp quarterly change request cr document 
the asp methodology uses quarterly drug pricing data submitted to the cms by drug manufacturers 
cms will supply contractors with the asp drug pricing files for medicare part b drugs on a quarterly basis 
beginning in january  cms s outpatient prospective payment system began paying for most separately payable medicare part b drugs administered in a hospital outpatient setting at a reimbursement level of asp plus and asp plus in other settings 
such outpatient price represented a decrease from asp and is part of a cms plan to transition to even lower reimbursement rates of asp in calendar year section d of the mma also requires the implementation of a competitive acquisition program the part b cap for medicare part b drugs and biologicals not paid on a cost or prospective payment system basis 
the part b cap is an alternative to the asp methodology for acquiring certain part b drugs which are administered incident to a physician s services 
currently  the part b cap is a voluntary program that offers physicians the option to acquire many injectable and infused drugs they use in their practice from an approved part b cap vendor  thus reducing the time and cost of buying and billing for drugs 
currently  the cap for part b drugs and biologicals is only for injectable and infused drugs currently billed under part b that are administered in a physician s office  incident to a physician s service 
in late  cms conducted the first round of bidding for approved part b cap vendors 
the part b cap was implemented on july  the cap vendor bidding period concluded on february  
index to financial statements submitted applications are now being evaluated by cms 
a three year contract for will be awarded to vendors for each program geographic area who have and maintain sufficient means to acquire and deliver competitively biddable drugs within the specified contract area  arrangements in effect for shipping at least days each week for the competitively biddable drugs under the contract and means to ship drugs in emergency situations  quality  service  financial performance and solvency standards  and a grievance and appeals process for dispute resolution 
up to five vendors may be selected  although only one vendor is currently approved 
approved part b cap vendors must also qualify for enrollment in medicare 
for  the part b cap will continue to have one geographic area which includes all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  the united states virgin islands  american samoa  guam and the northern mariana islands 
any part b cap vendor must also be licensed in accordance with state and federal requirements and in a manner that will allow the applicant to supply cap drugs in the geographic area 
at least one medicaid program has adopted  and other medicaid programs  some states and some private payors may be expected to adopt  those aspects of the mma that either result in or appear to result in price reductions for drugs covered by such programs 
adoption of asp as the measure for determining reimbursement by medicare and medicaid programs for the drugs sold by our specialty pharmacy operations could reduce revenue and gross margins and could materially affect our current awp based reimbursement structure with private payors 
we cannot assure you that the asp reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by our specialty pharmacy operations or that we will continue to be able to operate our specialty pharmacy operations profitably at either existing or at lower reimbursement rates 
likewise  we cannot assure you that the part b cap program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which we operate  or may seek to operate  in particular or that we would be able to meet the qualifications to become a part b cap vendor either now or at any time in the future 
competition there are many companies which provide one or more of the healthcare operations which comprise our pharmacy operations 
home healthcare business competitors range in size from small entrepreneurial operations to rapidly expanding businesses with strategies for national operations such as amedisys  inc  apria healthcare group  inc  gentiva health services  inc  and walgreen co 
specialty pharmacy operators range from local or regional pharmacies to large public companies such as option care  inc  a subsidiary of walgreen co  cvs caremark corporation  priority healthcare corporation and mim corporation 
healthcare regulation overview the healthcare industry is one of the largest industries in the united states and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
there are many factors that are highly significant to the healthcare industry including medicare  medicaid  and other public and private hospital cost containment programs  proposals to limit healthcare spending and proposals to limit prices and industry competition factors 
the healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
there continue to be federal and state proposals that would  and actions that do  impose limitations on government and private payments to providers  including community hospitals 
in addition  there regularly are proposals to increase co payments and deductibles from program and private patients 
hospital facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay 
such controls include what is commonly referred to as utilization review 
utilization review entails the review of a patient s admission and course of treatment by a third party 
historically  utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed 
utilization review is required in 
index to financial statements connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by medicare and medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  additional measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
various states have applied  or are considering applying  for a waiver from current medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their medicaid participants through managed care providers 
these proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured  and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals  physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under medicaid 
healthcare facility regulation certificate of need requirements a number of states require approval for the purchase  construction and expansion of various healthcare facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
certificates of need con  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters 
all four states in which sunlink currently operates hospitals alabama  georgia  mississippi and missouri have con laws that apply to such facilities 
the two states georgia and mississippi in which sunlink currently operates nursing homes skilled nursing facilities also have con laws that apply to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities 
states periodically review  modify and revise their con laws and related regulations 
in addition  future healthcare facility acquisitions may occur in states that require certificates of need 
sunlink is unable to predict whether its healthcare facilities will be able to obtain any certificates of need that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required 
violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities 
future healthcare facility acquisitions may occur in states that do not require certificates of need or which have less stringent con requirements than the states in which sunlink currently operates healthcare facilities 
any healthcare facility operated by sunlink in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance sunlink s healthcare facilities are subject to  and comply with  various forms of utilization review 
in addition  under the medicare prospective payment system  each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges in hospitals 
medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility  are overseen by each healthcare facility s local governing board  the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members  and are reviewed by sunlink s quality assurance personnel 
the local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care  develop long range plans  establish  review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act all of our facilities are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala this federal law requires any hospital that participates in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents himself to the hospital s emergency department for treatment and  if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition  to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition 
the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment 
there are 
index to financial statements severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay 
penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in addition  an injured patient  the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital 
in a final rule  effective november   cms clarified when a patient is considered to be on a hospital s property for purposes of treating the person pursuant to emtala 
cms stated that off campus facilities such as specialty clinics  surgery centers and other facilities that lack emergency departments should not be subject to emtala  but that these locations must have a plan explaining how the location should proceed in an emergency situation such as transferring the patient to the closest hospital with an emergency department 
cms further clarified that hospital owned ambulances could transport a patient to the closest emergency department instead of to the hospital that owns the ambulance 
cms rules did not specify on call physician requirements for an emergency department  but provided a subjective standard stating that on call hospital schedules should meet the hospital s and community s needs 
cms also did not directly address a number of issues  including whether emtala applies to direct admissions  individuals who come to a hospital pursuant to a physician s orders for a routine procedure  individuals who present themselves at a hospital s psychiatric department or delivery labor department  and whether screening requirements apply to patients transferred from other facilities 
although we believe that our hospitals comply with emtala  we cannot predict whether cms will implement new requirements in the future and whether we will be able to comply with any new requirements 
conversion legislation many states  including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals  have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not for profit entities 
in other states that do not have specific legislation  state attorneys generally have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste 
these legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the not for profit seller 
these reviews and  in some instances  approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition 
there can be no assurance that future actions on the state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals 
if these activities are widespread  they could limit our ability to acquire additional hospitals or increase our acquisition costs 
pharmacy operations regulation overview much like our healthcare facility operations  our pharmacy operations are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations governing their operations including laws and regulations with respect to operation of pharmacies  repackaging of drug products  wholesale distribution  dispensing of controlled substances  cross jurisdictional sale and distribution of pharmacy products  medical waste disposal  clinical trials and non discriminary access 
federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling  packaging  advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances 
federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and repackaging facilities with the united states drug enforcement administration and to comply with security  recordkeeping  inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances 
although we believe that our pharmacy operations have obtained or are obtaining the permits and or licenses required to conduct our pharmacy operations  failure to have the necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on our pharmacy business  and our financial condition or results of operations 

index to financial statements mail order activities currently the activities of our hospital pharmacies are ancillary to the operations of the facilities they serve 
in contrast  the operations of our pharmacy operations segment are stand alone operations that  in addition to walk in customers  distribute pharmaceuticals through a variety of delivery methods  including by mail and express delivery services 
many states in which we deliver or may seek to deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out of state mail service pharmacies to register with  or be licensed by  the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states 
these states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located 
however  various state medicaid programs have enacted laws and or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out of state pharmacies by  among other things  requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out of state pharmacy dispenses medications  whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located  or requiring the pharmacist in charge to be licensed in that state 
to the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations  we believe our pharmacy operations comply with them in all material respects 
to the extent that any of the foregoing laws or regulations prohibit or restrict the operation of mail service pharmacies and are found to be applicable to our pharmacy operations  they could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our pharmacy operations  which currently are concentrated in louisiana 
a number of state medicaid programs prohibit the participation in those states by out of state retail or mail service pharmacies  whether in state or out of state 
advertising and marketing regulations there are also other statutes and regulations which may also affect advertising  marketing and distribution of pharmacy products by our pharmacy operations 
the federal trade commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising  to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold  to fill mail orders within days  and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate 
healthcare regulations of general application licensing requirements sunlink s healthcare operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local licensing requirements 
in order to maintain their operating licenses  our healthcare facility operations must comply with strict standards concerning medical care  equipment and hygiene 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
all licenses  provider numbers  and other permits or approvals required to perform our business operations are held by individual subsidiaries of sunlink 
each of our hospital operating subsidiaries operates only a single hospital 
all of sunlink s hospitals  except the leased hospital in dexter  missouri  are fully accredited by jcaho 
drugs and controlled substances various licenses and permits are required by our healthcare facilities and pharmacy operations in order to dispense narcotics and operate pharmacies we are required to register our pharmacy operations for permits and or licenses with  and comply with certain operating and security standards of  the united states drug enforcement administration  or dea  the food and drug administration  or fda  state boards of pharmacy  state health departments and other state agencies in states where we operate or may seek to operate 
state controlled substance laws require registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure  registration or permit standards promulgated by the state s pharmacy licensing authority 
such standards often address the qualification of an applicant s personnel  the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities 
in general  pharmacy licenses are renewed annually 
pharmacists and pharmacy technicians employed at each of our dispensing locations must also satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 

index to financial statements fraud and abuse  anti kickback and self referral regulations participation in the medicare and or medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations 
if a hospital fails to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing a facility s activities  the hospital s participation in the medicare and or medicaid programs may be terminated and or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed 
for example  a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the medicare and or medicaid programs if it performs any of the following acts making claims to medicare and or medicaid for services not provided or misrepresenting actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments  paying money to induce the referral of patients or purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program  or failing to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital s campus or otherwise failing to properly treat and transfer emergency patients 
sections of the anti fraud and abuse amendments to the social security act  commonly known as the anti kickback statute  prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under medicaid  medicare or other federal healthcare programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by medicare or other government programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
pursuant to the medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of  the us department of health and human services hhs issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti kickback statute 
a given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal  however  business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program 
hipaa created civil penalties for proscribed conduct  including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
these new laws cover all health insurance programs  private as well as governmental 
in addition  hipaa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws  such as the anti kickback statute  to include not just medicare and medicaid services  but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program 
finally  hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse 
these new mechanisms include a bounty system where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies  as well as a whistleblower program  where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower 
hipaa also expands the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 
there is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities  the office of inspector general of the hhs  the courts and the us congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and opportunities 
investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
enforcement actions have increased  as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements 
certain exceptions are available for employment agreements  leases  physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements 
a person making a referral  or seeking payment for services referred  in violation of the stark act is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to for each service  restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims  and or exclusion from future participation in the medicare program  which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs 

index to financial statements further  if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity  and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity  then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty of up to many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals  some of which extend beyond the medicaid program  to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws a significant factor affecting the healthcare industry today is the use of the federal false claims act  usc et 
seq  and  in particular  actions brought by individuals on behalf of the united states under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the false claims act 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the united states alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
violations of the false claims act are punishable by damages equal to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between and for each separate false claim 
settlements entered prior to litigation usually involve a less severe damages methodology 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the false claims act defines the term knowingly broadly 
thus  although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the false claims act  submitting a claim with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the false claims act and  therefore  will provide grounds for liability 
in some cases whistleblowers or the federal government have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes  such as the anti kickback statute and the stark act  likewise thereby have submitted false claims under the false claims act 
a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court on behalf of such state governments 
hipaa transaction  privacy and security requirements hipaa and federal regulations issued pursuant to hipaa contain  among other measures  provisions that require us to implement modified or new computer systems  employee training programs and business procedures 
the federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry  provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information 
a violation of the hipaa regulations could result in civil money penalties of per incident  up to a maximum of per person per year per standard 
hipaa also provides for criminal penalties of up to and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information  up to and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell  transfer or use such information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
since there is no significant history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time  it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the hipaa regulations or the potential for fines and penalties  which may result from any violation of the regulations 
hipaa privacy regulations hipaa provided that if congress did not pass comprehensive health privacy legislation  the secretary of hhs was required to issue regulations designed to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
congress did not pass such legislation and hhs ultimately published final privacy regulations in the final privacy rule regulations contained technical corrections and additional clarifications designed to ensure that protections for patient privacy were implemented in a manner that maximizes privacy while not 
index to financial statements compromising either the availability or the quality of medical care 
the regulations became effective in april and compliance was required by april in  hhs published modifications to the privacy rule regulation 
the regulations increased consumers control over their medical records  mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient s right to privacy and  with a few exceptions  require that an individual s health information only be used for healthcare related purposes 
these privacy standards apply to all health plans  all healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers  such as our facilities  that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions  and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form 
these standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our facilities and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of this health information  and they require our facilities to impose these rules  by contract  on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on behalf of our facilities 
in addition  our facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties 
the hipaa privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards 
under the direction of sunlink s vice president  technical and compliance services  and in conjunction with a private hipaa consultant and hipaa coordinators at each facility  individually tailored policies and procedures were developed and implemented and hipaa privacy educational programs were presented to all employees and physicians at each facility prior to the compliance deadline 
we believe we are in compliance with current hipaa privacy regulations 
hipaa electronic data standards the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange 
these provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
among other things  these provisions require healthcare facilities to use standard data formats and code sets established by hhs when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions  including health claims and equivalent encounter information  healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status 
in  hhs published final regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions 
when fully implemented  the uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function 
compliance with these standards was required by october we believe that sunlink was fully compliant with the regulations and standards by the compliance date 
we have implemented a new management information system at our facilities and at our corporate headquarters over the last several years and we believe that such system complies with hipaa electronic data regulations and standards 
hipaa security standards the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa also required the implementation of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information 
the final rule adopting hipaa standards for the security of electronic health information required compliance by april  this final rule specifies a series of administrative  technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information 
the standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications 
under the direction of sunlink s vice president  technical and compliance services  and in conjunction with a consortium of rural hospitals  private hipaa security consultants and hipaa security officers at each facility  security assessments were performed  individually tailored plans to apply required or addressable solutions were implemented and a set of security policies and procedures were implemented 
in addition  an 
index to financial statements individually tailored comprehensive disaster contingency plan was developed and adopted by each facility and a hipaa security training program presented to all applicable personnel 
sunlink believes it is in full compliance with all aspects of the hipaa security regulations 
hipaa national provider identifier hipaa also required hhs to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals  employers  health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic transactions 
all healthcare providers  including our facilities  were required to obtain a new national provider identifier npi to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by may  our facilities have fully implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number 
hhs has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals 
once these regulations are issued in final form  we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant  but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time 
we cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers 
environmental regulations our operations  especially our healthcare facility operations  generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations also generally are subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
sunlink operations regulatory compliance program sunlink maintains a company wide compliance program under the direction of jerome orth  vice president  technical and compliance services 
mr 
orth has over twenty nine years experience in reimbursement in multi hospital corporations  at both the facility and corporate level 
sunlink s compliance program is directed at all areas of regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement and cost reporting practices  and laboratory and home healthcare operations 
each hospital designates a compliance officer and develops plans to correct problems should they arise 
in addition  all employees are provided with a copy of and given an introduction to sunlink s code of conduct  which includes ethical and compliance guidelines and instructions about the proper resources to utilize in order to address any concerns that may arise 
each hospital conducts annual training to re emphasize sunlink s code of conduct 
we monitor our corporate compliance program to respond to developments in healthcare regulations and the industry 
sunlink also maintains a toll free hotline to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis 
professional liability as part of our business  we are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations 
to cover these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts  which are commercially available  that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
in connection with the acquisition of our initial six community hospitals  sunlink assumed responsibility for general and professional liability claims reported after february  our acquisition date of such hospitals  and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims 
we have purchased claims made commercial insurance with a substantial self insured retention for coverage prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for general and professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february  and for claims incurred after february  in connection with the acquisition of healthmont and its two hospitals  sunlink assumed responsibility for all professional liability claims 
healthmont had purchased claims made commercial insurance 
index to financial statements for claims made prior to the acquisition 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of liability for claims assumed at the acquisition and for claims incurred after the acquisition 
these estimates are based on actuarially determined amounts 
in june  sunlink sold mountainside medical center  one of our initial six hospitals  but retained all liabilities and obligations arising from mountainside s operations prior to the date of such sale and purchased a year  claims made  extended discovery period tail policy for potential professional liability claims relating to mountainside 
discontinued operations and related contingent obligations over the past years we have discontinued operations carried on by our former mountainside medical center and our former industrial and life sciences and engineering segments  and our former uk child safety  leisure marine  and housewares segments 
sunlink s reserves relating to discontinued operations of these segments represent management s best estimate of our possible liability for property  product liability and other claims for which we may incur liability 
these estimates are based on management s judgments using currently available information as well as  in certain instances  consultation with our insurance carriers and legal counsel 
while estimates have been based on the evaluation of available information  it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of many contingencies relating to discontinued operations 
we intend to adjust our estimates of the reserves as additional information is developed and evaluated 
however  management believes that the final resolution of these contingencies will not have a material adverse impact on the financial position  cash flows or results of operations of the company 
beldray limited sunlink sold its former uk manufacturing subsidiary  beldray limited beldray  to two of beldray s managers in october beldray has since entered into administrative receivership 
krug international uk ltd 
krug uk  a uk subsidiary of sunlink  entered into a guarantee the beldray lease guarantee at a time when it owned beldray 
the beldray lease guarantee covers beldray s obligations under a lease of a portion of beldray s former manufacturing location 
in october  krug uk received correspondence from the landlord of such facility that the rent payment of  british pounds for the fourth quarter of had not been paid by beldray and requesting payment of such amount pursuant to the beldray lease guarantee 
in january  krug uk received further correspondence from the landlord demanding two quarterly rent payments totaling  british pounds under the beldray lease guarantee 
on january   the landlord filed a petition in the high court of justice chancery division to wind up krug uk under the provisions of the insolvency act of and krug uk was placed into involuntary liquidation by the high court in february after that date  the court appointed liquidator of krug uk made certain inquiries to sunlink and the subsidiary s directors regarding the activities of krug uk prior to the liquidation to which sunlink has responded 
on august   the liquidator of krug uk made an application in the birmingham county court in birmingham  england  in which the liquidator is seeking a declaration by the court that a transfer of certain funds in from krug uk to sunlink in connection with the purchase of certain preferred stock of another subsidiary of sunlink and the making of a loan to sunlink  and certain forgiveness of debt to sunlink by krug uk was improper  among other things  as krug uk was then effectively insolvent and that the approval of such transfers by the then directors of krug uk resulted in a breach of their fiduciary duties 
the liquidator seeks to have the court order the former directors or  in the alternative  the company  to account for  repay or restore such funds plus interest to the liquidator of krug uk 
on december   the case went to mediation and the mediation was adjourned pending the liquidator s investigations into the circumstances surrounding items raised by both parties 
in connection with the allegations in the application of breach of fiduciary duty by the directors of krug uk in approving such transfer of funds  sunlink has indemnification obligations to the former directors of krug uk 
sunlink denies any liability to krug uk other than to it in krug uk s status as a preferred stockholder and for the unpaid balance on the promissory note 
sunlink  through its united kingdom counsel  intends to vigorously defend against the liquidator s claims 

index to financial statements employee and labor relations as of june   sunlink employed  full time and part time persons in the us  none of whom are represented by a union 
we believe our labor relations generally are satisfactory 
environmental law compliance we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal  state and local environmental regulations 
to date  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial condition or competitive position 
similarly  we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations

risk factors in addition to other information contained in this annual report  including certain cautionary and forward looking statements  you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating an investment in sunlink consolidated operations risks sunlink has a limited operating history in the community hospital business and a limited history of profitability 
prior to february   sunlink operated in different business segments 
sunlink had income from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june   and  for the fiscal year ended june  conversely  sunlink had losses from continuing operations of  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june   for the three month transitional period ended june   and for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
sunlink may experience operating losses from continuing operations in the future 
sunlink s growth strategy depends in part on making successful acquisitions  via mergers  or otherwise  and on successfully integrating our recent acquisition of our pharmacy operations  which may expose sunlink to new liabilities 
as part of our growth strategy  sunlink will seek further growth through acquisitions  via mergers or otherwise  of rural and exurban healthcare businesses 
we have sought to acquire and have acquired rural and exurban community hospitals  nursing homes and home health agencies  as well as other rural and exurban healthcare businesses 
we may be subject to a variety of risks arising out of the acquisition of our new pharmacy business or other rural and exurban healthcare businesses 
we intend  to the extent possible  to integrate the operations of acquired assets and entities with our existing organizational structure  although our pharmacy operations  like our community hospitals  will be conducted in one or more separate subsidiaries 
in light of the diverse nature of our pharmacy operations and depending on the nature of other acquired entity or operations  integration of acquired operations into our present operations may present substantial difficulties 
even where material difficulties are not anticipated  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such difficulties in integrating acquired operations with our operations  which may result in a delay or the failure to achieve anticipated synergies  increased costs and failures to achieve increases in earnings or cost savings 
the difficulties of combining the operations of carmichael s or other acquired companies may include  among other things unidentified liabilities of carmichael s or of other companies sunlink may acquire or merge with  the potential failure to achieve economies of scale or synergies sought in our new pharmacy business or in other new rural or exurban healthcare businesses  
index to financial statements the possible inability to successfully integrate and manage acquired operations and personnel especially where such business is other than a community hospital or nursing home  possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  business cultures and compensation structures between us and an acquired entity  the inability to expand sales and marketing operations  the inability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  the loss of or inability to attract new key employees  the inability to achieve consolidation of corporate and administrative operations and infrastructures  the inability to achieve integration and management of the technologies and systems of the acquired entity  including the consolidation and integration of computer information systems  the failure to identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets  unexpected costs associated with the termination of assumed contractual obligations and the timing thereof  diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  the possibility of unexpected tax costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of the operations  the possible need and unexpected cost to modify internal controls over financial reporting in order to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act  the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated there under  and loss of customer goodwill 
for these reasons  we may fail to successfully complete the integration of carmichael s or any other acquired entity  or to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of carmichael s or any other acquired entity 
actual cost savings and synergies which may be achieved from carmichael s or any other acquired entity may be lower than we expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we anticipate 
other acquisition related risks include risks associated with higher costs or unexpected difficulties or problems with acquired assets  outdated or incompatible technologies  labor difficulties  or an inability to realize anticipated synergies and efficiencies 
whether within anticipated timeframes or at all  one or more of such acquisition related risks  if realized  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or operations 
acquired businesses may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
although sunlink has policies which require acquired operations to implement sunlink compliance standards  and generally will seek indemnification from prospective sellers covering these matters  sunlink may become liable for past activities of acquired businesses 
while sunlink received limited indemnification for certain potential liabilities in connection with its acquisition of carmichael s  there is no assurance such indemnification will be collectible or that any potential liabilities will not arise after expiration of such indemnification term 
additional debt for significant capital investments may be required to achieve sunlink s operational and growth plans  the inability to access capital may affect sunlink s competitive position  reduce earnings  and negatively affect the value of your sunlink common stock 
sunlink s growth plans require significant capital investments 
significant capital investments are required for on going and planned capital improvements at existing hospitals and may be required in connection with future capital projects either in connection with existing properties or future acquired properties 
sunlink s ability to make capital investments depends on numerous factors such as the availability of funds from operations and its credit facility and access to additional debt and equity financing 
no assurance can be given that the 
index to financial statements necessary funds will be available 
moreover  incurrence of additional debt financing  if available  may involve additional restrictive covenants that could negatively affect sunlink s ability to operate its business in the desired manner  and raising additional equity may be dilutive to shareholders 
the failure to obtain funds necessary for the realization of sunlink s growth plans could prevent sunlink from realizing its growth strategy and  in particular  could force sunlink to forego acquisition opportunities that may arise in the future 
this could  in turn  have a negative impact on sunlink s competitive position 
in order to make future acquisitions sunlink may be required to incur or assume additional indebtedness 
sunlink may not be able to obtain financing  if necessary  for any acquisitions that it might desire to make or it might be required to borrow at higher rates and on less favorable terms than its competitors 
many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting sales  leases or other transactions in which control of not for profit hospitals is acquired by for profit corporations 
these laws  in general  include provisions relating to state attorney general approval  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  state attorneys general in states without specific legislation governing these transactions may exercise authority based upon charitable trust and other existing law 
the increased legal and regulatory review of transactions involving the change of control of not for profit entities may increase the costs required  or limit sunlink s ability  to acquire not for profit hospitals 
sunlink s revenues are heavily concentrated in georgia which will make sunlink particularly sensitive to economic and other changes in the state of georgia 
for the fiscal year ended june   our three georgia hospitals generated approximately of revenues for the year 
accordingly  any change in the current demographic  economic  competitive or regulatory conditions in the state of georgia could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects of sunlink 
sunlink depends heavily on its management personnel and the loss of the services of one or more of sunlink s key senior management personnel could weaken sunlink s management team 
sunlink has been  and will continue to be  dependent upon the services and management experience of its executive officers 
if any of sunlink s executive officers were to resign their positions or otherwise be unable to serve  sunlink s management could be weakened and operating results could be adversely affected  however  to our knowledge  no key executive personnel intend to retire or terminate their employment with sunlink in the near future 
sunlink conducts business in a heavily regulated industry  changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce revenue and profitability 
the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  addition of facilities and services  confidentiality  maintenance  and security issues associated with medical records  billing for services  and prices for services 

index to financial statements these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations  including in particular  medicare and medicaid anti fraud and abuse amendments  codified in section b b of the social security act and known as the anti kickback statute 
this law prohibits providers and others from soliciting  receiving  offering or paying  directly or indirectly  any remuneration with the intent to generate referrals of orders for services or items reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  and other federal healthcare programs 
as authorized by congress  the united states department of health and human services  or hhs  has issued regulations which describe some of the conduct and business relationships immune from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
the fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these safe harbor provisions does not render the arrangement illegal 
however  business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria risk increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals 
we have contracts with physicians providing services under a variety of financial arrangements such as employment contracts and professional service agreements 
we also provide financial incentives  including loans and minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals 
hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws to include all healthcare services  whether or not they are reimbursed under a federal program 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services in which the physicians or their immediate family members have an ownership interest or certain other financial arrangements 
in addition  sunlink s facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under hipaa  which vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
in recent years  both federal and state government agencies have announced plans for or implemented heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts 
government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing healthcare laws could assert that sunlink or any of the transactions in which the company or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved  are in violation of these laws 
it is also possible that these laws ultimately could be interpreted by the courts in a manner that is different from the interpretations made by each company 
a determination that either sunlink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved in a transaction that violated these laws  or the public announcement that sunlink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on sunlink s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and sunlink s business reputation could suffer significantly 
the laws  rules  and regulations described above are complex and subject to interpretation 
in the event of a determination that we are in violation of any of these laws  rules or regulations  or if further changes in the regulatory framework occur  our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
sunlink is and in the future could be subject to claims related to discontinued operations  hospitals sold by our healthmont subsidiary prior to its acquisition  and claims related to the disposition of our former mountainside medical center 
over the past years  sunlink has discontinued operations carried on by its former industrial and life sciences and engineering segments  and uk child safety segments  leisure marine  and housewares segments and its former mountainside medical center by virtue of the sale of such facility whose original facility was one of our original hospitals 
prior to our acquisition of our healthmont subsidiaries  healthmont had sold two hospitals and it also disposed of one additional hospital as a condition to our acquisition of healthmont 
sunlink s reserves relating to discontinued operations represent management s best estimate of possible liability 
index to financial statements for property  product liability  and other claims for which sunlink may incur liability 
these estimates are based on management s judgments using currently available information as well as  in certain instances  consultation with sunlink s insurance carriers and legal counsel 
sunlink currently does not purchase insurance policies to reduce product liability or other discontinued operations exposures and does not anticipate it will purchase such insurance in the future 
while estimates have been based on the evaluation of available information  it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of many contingencies relating to discontinued operations 
furthermore  future events or evaluations could cause us to adjust existing reserves in connection with our operations 
sunlink intends to adjust our estimates of required reserves from time to time as additional information is developed and evaluated 
however  sunlink believes that the final resolution of known contingencies will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
sunlink is subject to potential claims for professional liability  including claims based on the acts or omissions of third parties  which claims may not be covered by insurance 
sunlink is subject to potential claims for professional liability medical malpractice  both in connection with our current operations  as well as acquired operations 
to cover these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
the assertion of a significant number of claims  either within our self insured retention deductible or individually or in the aggregate in excess of available insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
premiums for professional liability insurance have historically been volatile and we can not assure you that professional liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the operations of our hospitals also depend on the professional services of physicians and other trained healthcare providers and technicians in the conduct of their respective operations  including independent laboratories and physicians rendering diagnostic and medical services 
there can be no assurance that any legal action stemming from the act or omission of a third party provider of healthcare services  would not be brought against one of our hospitals or sunlink  resulting in significant legal expenses in order to defend against such legal action or to obtain a financial contribution from the third party whose acts or omissions occasioned the legal action 
risks related to our healthcare facility operations sunlink s success depends on its ability to maintain good relationships with the physicians at its hospitals and  if sunlink is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  admissions and outpatient revenues at sunlink hospitals may decrease and sunlink s operating performance could decline 
because physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and outpatient services  sunlink s success is  in part  dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on the medical staffs of its hospitals  the admissions and referrals practices of the physicians at its hospitals  and its ability to maintain good relations with its physicians 
physicians at sunlink hospitals are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and  in many of the markets that sunlink serves  most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to sunlink s hospitals 
if sunlink is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  admissions at sunlink hospitals may decrease and sunlink s operating performance could decline 
sunlink depends heavily on its healthcare facility management personnel and the loss of the services of one or more of sunlink s key local management personnel could weaken sunlink s management team and its ability to deliver healthcare services 
sunlink s success depends on its ability to attract and retain managers at its hospitals and related health care facilities  on the ability of hospital based officers and key employees to manage growth successfully  and on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
sunlink has not had any material difficulties in attracting healthcare facility management  however  if sunlink is unable to attract and retain affective local management  the operating performance of our facilities could decline 

index to financial statements sunlink s success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals and a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals in certain markets could weaken our ability to deliver healthcare services 
in addition to the physicians and management personnel whom sunlink employs  sunlink s operations are dependent on the efforts  ability  and experience of other healthcare professionals  such as nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians 
nurses  pharmacists  lab technicians and other healthcare professionals are generally employees of each individual sunlink hospital 
sunlink s success has been  and will continue to be  influenced by its ability to attract and retain these skilled employees 
a shortage of healthcare professionals in certain markets  the loss of some or all of its key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could cause sunlink s operating performance to decline 
a significant portion of sunlink s revenue is dependent on medicare and medicaid payments  and possible reductions in medicare or medicaid payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues 
a significant portion of sunlink s revenues are derived from the medicare and medicaid programs  which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
sunlink derived approximately of its patient days and of its net patient revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs for the year ended june  previous legislative changes have resulted in  and future legislative changes may result in  limitations on and reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs 
future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on sunlink s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
revenue and profitability of our healthcare facility operations  especially our community hospital operations  may be constrained by future cost containment initiatives undertaken by purchasers of healthcare services if sunlink is unable to contain costs 
our community hospital operations derived approximately of its net patient revenues for the fiscal year ended june  from private payors and other non governmental sources who contributed approximately of sunlink s patient days 
our hospitals have been affected by the increasing number of initiatives undertaken during the past several years by all major purchasers of healthcare  including in addition to federal and state governments insurance companies and employers  to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare expenditures in order to contain healthcare costs 
initiatives such as managed care organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services packages have adversely affected hospital revenue growth throughout the country and such packages represent an increasing portion of sunlink s admissions and outpatient revenues and have resulted in reduced revenue growth at our hospitals 
in addition  private payers increasingly are attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis  increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  referred to as ppos 
if we are unable to contain costs  especially in our hospital operations  through increased operational efficiencies and the trend toward declining reimbursements and payments continues  the results of healthcare facility segment operations and cash flow will be adversely affected and the results of our consolidated operations and our consolidated cash flow similarly likely would be adversely affected 
our healthcare facilities  especially our community hospitals  face intense competition from other hospitals and healthcare providers which directly affect our segment and consolidated revenues and profitability 
although each of our hospitals operates in communities where they are currently the only general  acute care hospital  they do face competition from other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers 
although these competing hospitals may be as far as to miles away  patients in these markets may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals  managed care plan incentives or personal choice 

index to financial statements the healthcare business is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
each of our hospitals operates in geographic areas where they compete with at least one other hospital that provides services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
some of these competing facilities offer services  including extensive medical research and medical education programs  which are not offered by sunlink s facilities 
some of the competing hospitals are owned or operated by tax supported governmental bodies or by private not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions which can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and are exempt from sales  property  and income taxes 
in some of these markets  sunlink s hospitals also face competition from other for profit hospital companies  some of which have substantially greater resources  as well as other providers such as outpatient surgery and diagnostic centers 
the intense competition from other hospitals and other healthcare providers directly affects the market share of our community hospitals  as well as their and our revenues and profitability 
changes in market demographics may increase competition for certain of our community hospitals 
some of our hospitals are located in exurban areas which are becoming more suburban or metropolitan 
such markets are likely to attract additional competitors  including satellite operations of tertiary hospitals 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to fund capital improvements to our existing facilities  which may face additional competition or that even if financial resources are available to us  projected operating results will justify such expenditures 
an inability to fund or the infeasibility of funding capital improvements could directly or indirectly have an adverse impact on hospital revenues through lower patient utilization  increased difficulty in physician recruitment and otherwise as a result of increased competition 
sunlink s hospitals are and our other healthcare facilities may be subject to  and depend on  certificate of need laws which could affect their ability to operate profitably 
all states in which sunlink currently operates hospitals and nursing homes have laws affecting acute care hospital facilities  nursing homes  ambulatory surgery centers and the provision of various services  such laws are known as certificate of need laws 
under such laws  prior state approval is required for the acquisition of major medical equipment or the purchase  lease  construction  expansion  sale or closure of covered healthcare facilities  based on a determination of need for additional or expanded facilities or services 
the required approval is known generally as a certificate of need or con 
a con may be required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in hospital and nursing home bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
the failure to obtain any required con may impair sunlink s ability to operate profitably 
in addition  the elimination or modification of con laws in states in which sunlink operates or in the future may own hospitals and other covered healthcare facilities could subject our hospitals to greater competition making it more difficult to operate profitably 
risk relating to our pharmacy operations 
our pharmacy operations  especially the specialty pharmacy service line of such operations  may be adversely affected by changes in government reimbursement regulations and payment levels 
our initial pharmacy operations are expected to derive approximately of their net revenues from government payors  principally medicare and medicaid 
the deficit reduction act of exempted rural providers of home care related services from the competitive acquisition program to which urban providers are subject 
we cannot assure you that the asp reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by our specialty pharmacy operations or that we will continue to be able to operate our specialty pharmacy operations profitably at either 
index to financial statements existing or at lower reimbursement rates 
likewise  we cannot assure you that the part b cap program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which we operate  or may seek to operate  in particular or that we would be able to meet the qualifications to become a part b cap vendor either now or at any time in the future 
our pharmacy business could be harmed by further changes in government purchasing methodologies and reimbursement rates for medicare or medicaid 
in addition to the impact of mma implemented or inspired changes  in order to deal with budget shortfalls  some states are attempting to create state administered prescription drug discount plans  to limit the number of prescriptions per person that are covered  and to raise medicaid co pays and deductibles  and are proposing more restrictive formularies and reductions in pharmacy reimbursement rates 
any reductions in amounts reimbursable by other government programs for our services or changes in regulations governing such reimbursements could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our durable medical equipment service line may be adversely affected by changes in government reimbursement regulations and payment levels  especially if our durable medical equipment service line becomes subject to competitive bidding procedures 
although we are currently exempted under the deficit reduction act of from the competitive acquisition program for dmepos  we cannot be sure such exemption will continue to be available in the future 
loss of such exemption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation 
our pharmacy operations depend on a continuous supply of key products 
any shortages of key products could adversely affect our business 
many of the biopharmaceutical products distributed by our specialty pharmacy operations are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages 
in addition  the manufacturers of these products may not have adequate manufacturing capability to meet rising demand 
if any products we distribute are in short supply for long periods of time  this could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our pharmacy operations are highly dependent on relationships with key suppliers and the loss of any of such key suppliers could adversely affect our business 
any termination of  or adverse change in  our relationships with our key suppliers  or the loss of supply of one of our key products for any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the largest supplier for our specialty pharmacy operations accounted for approximately of carmichael s total net sales in our specialty pharmacy operations have a single source of supply for many of our key products  including one product which accounted for approximately of carmichael s total net sales in in addition  we have few long term contracts with our suppliers 
our arrangements with most of our suppliers may be canceled by either party  without cause  on minimal notice 
many of these arrangements are not governed by written agreements 
the loss of one or more of our larger institutional pharmacy customers could hurt our business by reducing the revenues and profitability of our pharmacy operations 
as is customary in the institutional pharmacy industry  our pharmacy operations generally do not have long term contracts with our institutional pharmacy customers 
significant declines in the level of purchases by one or more of our larger institutional pharmacy customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our failure to maintain eligibility as a medicare and medicaid supplier could materially adversely affect our competitive position 
likewise  our failure to maintain and expand relationships with private payors  who can effectively determine the pharmacy source for their members  could materially adversely affect our competitive position 

index to financial statements changes in average wholesale prices could reduce our pricing and margins 
many government payors  including medicare and medicaid  have paid  or continue to pay  our pharmacy operations directly or indirectly at a percentage off a drug s average wholesale price  or awp 
we also have contracted with some private payors to sell drugs at awp or at a percentage off awp 
awp for most drugs is compiled and published by several private companies  including first databank  inc several states have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers for allegedly inflating reported awp for prescription drugs 
in addition  class action lawsuits have been brought by consumers against pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging overstatement of awp 
we are not responsible for such calculations  reports or payments  however  there can be no assurance that the ability of our pharmacy operations to negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers will not be materially adversely affected by such investigations or lawsuits 
the federal government has also entered into settlement agreements with several drug manufacturers relating to the calculation and reporting of awp pursuant to which the drug manufacturers  among other things  have agreed to report new pricing information  the average sales price  to government healthcare programs 
the average sales price is calculated differently than awp 
we face numerous competitors and potential competitors in our pharmacy operations  many of whom are significantly larger and who have significantly greater financial resources 
although we believe market penetration by large national companies into our existing market for our pharmacy operations has not been substantial  we cannot assure you that one of more of such companies or other healthcare companies will not seek to compete or intensify their level of competition in the rural and exurban areas in which we conduct or may seek to conduct one or more of the components of our pharmacy operations 
our pharmacy operations  especially the specialty pharmacy component of such operations  may be adversely affected by industry trends in managed care contracting and consolidation 
a growing number of health plans are contracting with a single provider of specialty pharmacy services 
likewise  manufacturers may not be eager to contract with regional providers of specialty pharmacy services 
if we are unable to obtain managed care contracts in the areas in which we provide specialty pharmacy services or are unable to obtain specialty pharmacy products at reasonable costs or at all  our business could be adversely affected 
the specialty pharmacy market may grow slower than expected which could adversely affect our revenues 
according to an analysis of ims health data  spending in the us in for specialty drugs was  or of overall prescription drug spending for that year 
sales of biotech products alone a subset of specialty pharmaceuticals are estimated by the same consultant to have reached  in even more conservative estimates place the size of the specialty pharmacy market between  and  such estimates place the administrative spending for this segment at in excess of of the pure cost of drug and care 
a healthcare consulting firm has estimated that of the unique biopharmaceuticals in late stage development in the us are infusible and injectables and that there are over specialty medications in phase one  phase two or phase three development 
as a result  the percentage of spending for specialty pharmaceuticals may increase to more than  by and grow to represent more than percent of total drug spending 
we cannot predict whether the rate of actual future growth in product availability and spending will match projections  the extent to which patient demand or spending for specialty drug services in rural or exurban areas will match national averages or whether government payors will provide reimbursement for new products under medicare or medicare on a timely basis or at all or at what rates 
adverse developments in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our pharmacy business 

index to financial statements other risks sunlink may issue additional equity in the future which could dilute the value of shares of existing shareholders 
sunlink s working capital is limited to cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our  credit facility of which approximately  is available to borrow at june  and our additional debt capacity is limited 
management and the board of directors of sunlink periodically have discussed the need to raise equity in the future and periodically have considered certain transactions which might be available to sunlink to raise equity 
however  sunlink has not engaged any underwriter or placement agent with respect to any potential equity offering  nor has sunlink s management made any specific proposal or recommendation to the sunlink board of directors with respect to the type of securities to be offered or the price at which any securities might be offered 
such transactions might include  among others  the sale of common shares to outsiders or the offer to existing shareholders of the right to acquire additional shares 
while the board of directors has not decided to effect any equity transaction at this time  it may do so in the future 
any equity transaction could result in dilution in the value of existing shares

year in review and recent developments during the year ended june   we concentrated our efforts on the operations and improvement of our existing hospitals  the acquisition of carmichael  which was completed in april  and the evaluation of strategic alternatives 
on april   we acquired carmichael s cashway pharmacy  inc carmichael 
the carmichael acquisition purchase price was  consisting of  cash  seller subordinated debt of  and  in sunlink shares  shares 
carmichael had annual revenues of approximately  for its year ended december  and has been in business for over years 
carmichael provides services to patients in rural communities in southwest louisiana and eastern texas 
carmichael is included in specialty pharmacy segment 
strategic alternatives on november   we announced that we had received an unsolicited conditional acquisition proposal from resurgence health group  llc which purported to offer a cash price of per share for substantially all the outstanding shares of sunlink  subject to a number of conditions 
on january   we announced that we had retained stephens inc for the purpose of advising our board of directors in connection with an evaluation of the company s strategic alternatives  including  among others  the proposal by resurgence health group  llc 
since retaining stephens  sunlink has explored a number of strategic alternatives  none of which to 
index to financial statements date has been judged by our board to be superior in terms of price and execution risk to continuing as an independent company and pursuing sunlink s existing business plans 
to continue the evaluation on an on going basis  the board has formed a standing strategic alternatives committee of the board of directors to  among other things  conduct periodic evaluations of the company s strategic alternatives 
investors are cautioned that no inference should be drawn from the existence of such committee and its charter with respect to the probability that the company will engage in any transaction as a result of the periodic evaluation of strategic alternatives  including with respect to any proposal previously submitted or which in the future may be re submitted or newly presented to the company 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings or financial condition

we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

index to financial statements the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share receivables net and provision for bad debts receivables net for our healthcare facilities segment primarily consists of amounts due from third party payors and patients from providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
receivables net for our specialty pharmacy segment primarily consists of amounts due from third party payors  institutions such as nursing homes  home health  hospice  hospitals  pharmacy stores  medicaid part d program  and customers from providing pharmacy services and merchandise 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets as of june was as follows  and our provision for bad debts  included in our results of operations  was as follows  and the largest component of bad debts in our patient accounts receivable for our healthcare facilities and specialty pharmacy segments relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
we attempt to verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled non emergency admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the estimated amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and non emergency urgent admissions in compliance with the emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and potentially our future access to capital 
if net revenues during fiscal were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately  or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by  among other things  changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in private and federal or state governmental healthcare coverage

our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is typically no longer than days after the date of discharge of the patient or service to the patient 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improved performance 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of the referral of an account to a collection agency vary among hospitals 
generally  we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency 
once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful  an account is written off from our patient accounting system against the allowance for doubtful accounts 

index to financial statements balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share receivables net and provision for bad debts continued we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a quarter by quarter basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as days revenue in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians 
days outstanding payor class total medicare commercial medicaid self pay total the above table shows net patient accounts receivable aged from patient billing date and are grouped by classification of verified insurance coverage 
the receivables are net of contractual allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts are calculated by payor class and are not calculated by the aging of the patient billing date  therefore  these allowances have been allocated within the aging of the various payor classes based upon gross patient receivable amounts

for our specialty pharmacy segment  we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided and at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise 
patient receivables primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors  such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are determined pursuant to contracts or established government rates and are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and patient receivables are reduced to net amounts receivable pursuant to such contracts or government payment rates through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately of our revenues during relate to discounted charges 
the sources of these revenues were as follows as a percentage of total revenues medicare  medicaid  and commercial insurance 
revenues are recorded at estimated amounts due from patients  third party payors  institutions  pharmacies  and others for healthcare and pharmacy services and goods provided net of contractual discounts pursuant to contract or government payment rates 
estimates for contractual allowances are calculated using computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved 
in certain hospitals  the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor 
in other hospitals  the contractual allowances are estimated manually using historical collections for each type of payor 
for all hospitals  certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us 
all contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience on a periodic basis 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors  institutions  pharmacies  and patients 
amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by hmos  ppos and other private insurers are generally less than our established billing rates 
we include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials

the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under this prospective reimbursement system  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
adjustments related to final settlements for revenues retrospectively increased our revenues by the following amounts  and discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in periods before  are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
commercial insurance commercial insurance for most managed care plans  contractual allowances estimated at the time of service are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
we evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowance percentages historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by managed care payors  review of contractual allowance information reflecting if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on all of our commercial revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios

a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
goodwill and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets including separately identified intangible assets of acquired companies 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june  for the following years was as follows  and the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of healthmont  inc and the acquisition of carmichael 
we follow the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of june of each year 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of june  and using the methodology described here  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and is subject to change during the

we engage independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
fair value estimates are derived from independent appraisals  established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns 
professional and general liability claims we are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims as part of providing healthcare services 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we have maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self insured retention amount 
for the period february  to february   the self insured retention amount was per individual claim 
for the period february  to february   our self insured retention level was  on individual malpractice claims 
for the period march  to february   our self insured retention level was on the reserve for professional and general liability claims is based upon independent actuarial calculations  which consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the determination of reserve estimates 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses recorded during a reporting period 
in determining loss estimates  professional judgment is used by each actuary by selecting factors that are considered appropriate by the actuary for our specific circumstances 
changes in assumptions used by our independent actuary with respect to demographics and geography  industry trends  development patterns and 
index to financial statements balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share professional and general liability claims continued individual malpractice claims 
for the periods  march  to february   march  to february   and march  to february  our self insured retention level was or will be  on individual malpractice claims 
each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs have increased in recent years  we have accepted a higher level of risk in self insured retention levels 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june was as follows  and the total expense for professional and general liability coverage  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows  and estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
we revise our reserve estimation process by obtaining independent actuarial calculations quarterly 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes as estimated by our independent actuaries when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states  including georgia  have passed varying forms of tort reform which may attempt to limit the number and types of claims and the amount of some medical malpractice awards 
if enacted limitations remain in place or if similar laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
conversely  liberalization of the number and type of claims and damage awards permitted under any such law applicable to our operations could cause our loss estimates to increase 
judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact currently on our liquidity or capital resources 

index to financial statements balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our net deferred tax asset balance net of valuation allowance in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years was as follows  and our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years were as follows  and in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in the first step of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we identify tax issues that we believe may be challenged upon examination by the taxing authorities 
we also assess the likelihood of sustaining tax benefits associated with tax planning strategies and reduce tax benefits based on management s judgment regarding such likelihood 
we compute the tax on each contingency 
we then determine the amount of loss  or reduction in tax benefits based upon the foregoing and reflect such amount as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period 
our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by  as of june   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
we generated federal taxable income in fiscal years  and therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets is remote 
the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur approximately of additional tax payments for plus applicable penalties and interest 

index to financial statements balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share accounting for income taxes continued we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period

we understand that certain industry analysts and investors generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the liquidity of a company  and it is presented to assist analysts and investors in analyzing the ability of a company to generate cash  service debt and meet capital requirements 
we believe increased ebitda is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations 
where we adjust ebitda for non cash charges we refer to such measurement as adjusted ebitda  which we report on a company wide basis 
non cash adjustments in adjusted ebitda are not intended to be identified or characterized in any respect as non recurring  infrequent or unusual  if we believe such charge is reasonably likely to recur within two years  or if there was a similar charge or gain within the prior two years 
where we report adjusted ebitda  we typically also report hospital facilities segment adjusted ebitda and specialty pharmacy segment adjusted ebitda which is the ebitda for the applicable segments without any allocation of corporate overhead  which we report as a separate line item  and without any allocation of the non cash adjustments  which we also report as a separate line item in adjusted ebitda

the liquidator seeks to have the court order that the former directors or  in the alternative  sunlink  be required to account for  repay or restore such funds to the liquidator of krug uk 
in connection with the allegations in the application of breach of fiduciary duty by the directors of krug uk in approving the transfer of such funds  sunlink has indemnification obligations to the former directors of krug uk 
each of the directors of krug uk and sunlink have now been served 
sunlink denies any liability to krug uk other than to it in krug uk s status as a preferred stockholder and for the unpaid balance on the promissory note 
sunlink  through its united kingdom counsel  intends to vigorously defend against the liquidator s claims 
sunlink s non current liability reserves for discontinued operations at june   included a reserve for a portion of the beldray guarantee  which would be sought pursuant to the application made by the liquidator of krug uk 
such reserve was based upon management s estimate  after consultation with its property consultants and legal counsel  of the cost to satisfy the beldray guarantee in light of krug uk s limited assets and before taking into account any other claims against krug uk 
the maximum potential obligation of krug uk for rent under the beldray guarantee is estimated to be approximately  sunlink expensed in the fiscal 
index to financial statements year ended june  on legal costs to defend against the claim
