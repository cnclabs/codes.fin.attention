table of contents improving comparable store sales we strive to improve our comparable stores sales by re focusing on our micro merchandising strategy and narrowing our shoe offerings  while focusing on better selling styles 
we also expect to complement our in store sales with internet sales and our catalog 
we attempt to keep our product mix fresh and on target by constantly testing new fashions and actively monitoring sell through rates in our stores 
our team of footwear retailers  in house designers and merchants use their industry experience  relationships with agents and branded footwear producers  and their participation in industry trade shows to analyze  interpret and translate fashion trends affecting young women into the footwear and accessory styles they desire 
to complement the introduction of new merchandise  we view the majority of our styles as core fashion styles that carry over for multiple seasons 
our merchants make subtle changes to these styles each season to keep them fresh  while reducing our fashion risk exposure 
we employ a test and react strategy that constantly updates our product mix while managing inventory risk 
this strategy is supported by our relationships with manufacturers  which allow our merchandising and buying teams to negotiate short lead times  enabling us to test new styles and react relatively quickly to fashion trends and keep fast moving inventory in stock 
we also intend to improve comparable store sales increases through branded and private label accessories 
accessories accounted for of merchandise sales in fiscal year and we believe that there is significant potential to expand our accessory sales and margins 
our stores sell national branded footwear and accessories because we believe that branded merchandise is important to our customers  adds credibility to our stores and drives customer traffic  increasing our overall sales volume and profitability  while reducing our overall exposure to fashion risk 
we believe the presence of national branded merchandise in our product mix will also increase the sales of our private label merchandise 
we continue to add sought after brands and to enhance the value of our private label assortment 
approximately of our net shoe sales for fiscal year consisted of branded footwear 
for fiscal year  our internet and catalog sales were million 
we believe our web presence is important in expanding our ability to reach our target customer base and enhances the services we provide our customers 
furthermore  we believe our internet store increases customer traffic at our bakers stores and enables potential customers to locate our stores 
starting in fiscal year  we have been mailing the bakers catalog to existing and prospective customers 
we believe that the catalog allows us to broaden our appeal by showcasing our stylish image and upscale offerings 
we anticipate issuing three catalogs during fiscal year  with an average mailing of approximately  copies 
we believe that our catalogs provide an additional channel for our customers to purchase our merchandise and will increase traffic at our internet store and our mall stores 
long term strengths we have delayed most of our store expansion plans until our liquidity improves 
we are also subject to limitations under our debt agreements on the amount we can spend on capital expenditures through fiscal year over the long term  we believe that there are substantial opportunities of us to grow our business 
we opened six stores in fiscal year and plan to open two stores in fiscal year in selecting specific sites  we look for high traffic locations primarily in regional shopping malls 
we evaluate proposed sites based on the traffic patterns  type and quality of other tenants  average sales per square foot achieved by neighboring stores  lease terms and other factors considered important with respect to a specific location 
we constantly update our search for new locations and have identified additional locations for potential new stores 
we opened new stores in fiscal year and new stores in fiscal year as of april   we have opened one new store in fiscal year construction costs for new stores currently average approximately  in connection with opening a new store  we typically receive a construction allowance from the landlord  which can range from  to over  
table of contents we believe that the operating infrastructure we have in place is capable of integrating a significant number of new stores with relatively little additional increase in general and administrative expenses 
virtually all of our senior management executives have held similar positions at specialty retail chains of substantially greater size 
we believe that our buying teams have sufficient levels of experience to support our expected new store growth 
finally  we believe that our information and logistics systems are scalable to support significant growth 
product development and merchandising our merchants analyze  interpret and translate current and emerging lifestyle trends into footwear and accessories for our customers 
our merchants and senior management use various methods to monitor changes in culture and fashion 
our buyers travel to major domestic and international markets  such as new york  london and milan  to gain an understanding of fashion trends 
we attend major footwear trade shows and analyze various information services which provide broad themes on the direction of fashion and color for upcoming seasons 
we also monitor current music  television  movie and magazine themes as they relate to clothing and footwear styles 
a crucial element of our product development is our test and react strategy 
we typically buy small quantities of new footwear and deliver merchandise to a cross section of stores 
we monitor sell through rates on test merchandise and  if the tests are successful  quickly re order product to be distributed to a larger base of stores 
frequently  we can make initial determinations as to the results of a product test 
our senior management team has extensive experience in retail and in responding to changes in our business 
we work with merchandisers  buyers and our distribution system to attempt to respond timely to changes in consumer trends while effectively controlling overhead and inventory 
in addition to our test and react strategy  we also attempt to moderate our fashion risk exposure through the national branded component of our merchandise mix 
the national brands carried by our stores tend to focus on fashion basic merchandise supported by national advertising by the producer of the brand  which helps generate demand from our target customer 
we hope to gain substantial brand affinity by carrying these lines 
we believe that a customer who enters our store with the intent of shopping for national branded footwear will also consider the purchase of our lower price  higher gross margin private label merchandise 
product mix we sell both casual and dress footwear 
casual footwear includes sport shoes  sandals  athletic shoes  outdoor footwear  casual daywear  weekend casual  casual booties and tall shafted boots 
dress footwear includes career footwear  tailored shoes  dress shoes  special occasion shoes and dress booties 
private label 
our private label merchandise  which comprised approximately of our net shoe sales in fiscal year  is generally sold under the bakers label and  in some instances  is supplied to us on an exclusive basis 
the retail prices of our private label footwear generally range from to with most offerings in the to range 
we are able to offer these prices without sacrificing merchandise quality  creating a high perceived value  promoting multiple sale transactions  and allowing us to build a loyal customer base 
once our management team has arrived at a consensus on fashion themes for the upcoming season  our buyers translate these themes into our merchandise 
to produce our private label footwear  we generally begin with a shoe that our buying teams have discovered during their travels or that is brought to us by one of our commissioned buying agents 
working with our agents  we develop a prototype shoe  which we refer to as a sample 
we control the process by focusing on key color  fabric and pattern selections  and collaborate with our buying agents to establish production deadlines 
once our buyers have approved the sample  our buying agents arrange for the purchase of necessary materials and contract with factories to manufacture the footwear to our specifications 
we establish manufacturing deadlines in order to ensure a consistent flow of inventory into the stores  emphasizing relatively short lead times 
depending upon where the shoes are produced and where the materials are sourced  we can have shoes delivered to our stores in four to weeks 
for more information  please see sourcing and distribution 

table of contents our success depends upon our customers perception of new and fresh merchandise 
our test and react strategy reduces our risk on new styles of footwear 
we also manage our markdown exposure by re interpreting our core product 
approximately one half of our private label mix is core product  which we define as styles that carry over for multiple seasons 
our buyers make changes to core product which include colors  fabrications and modified styling to create renewed interest among our customers 
we also have relationships with some producers of national brands that  from time to time  produce comparable versions of their branded footwear under our private label brands 
our information systems are designed to identify trends by item  style  color and or size 
in response  our merchandise team generates a key item report to more carefully monitor and support sales  including reordering additional units of certain items  if available 
merchandising teams and buyers work together to develop new styles to be presented at monthly product review and selection meetings 
these new styles incorporate variations on existing styles in an effort to capitalize further on the more popular silhouettes and heel heights or entirely new styles and fabrications that respond to emerging trends or customer preferences 
national brands 
our stores carry nationally recognized branded merchandise which we believe increases the attractiveness of our product offering to our target customers 
our branded shoe sales comprised approximately of our net shoe sales for fiscal year we believe that branded merchandise is important to our customers  adds credibility to our stores and drives customer traffic resulting in increased customer loyalty and sales 
important national brands in our stores include ed hardy  jessica simpson  bcbgirls  guess sport  steve madden  rocket dog  and baby phat 
we believe offering nationally recognized brands is a key element to attracting appearance conscious young women 
branded merchandise sells at a higher price point than our private label merchandise 
as a result  despite a lower gross margin percentage  branded merchandise generates greater gross profits per pair and leverages our operating costs 
accessories 
our branded and private label accessories include handbags  jewelry  sunglasses  ear clips and earrings  hosiery  scarves and other items 
our accessory products allow us to offer the convenience of one stop shopping to our customers  enabling them to complement their seasonal ready to wear clothing with color coordinated footwear and accessories 
accessories add to our overall sales and typically generate higher gross margins than our footwear 
merchandise mix 
the following table illustrates net sales by merchandise category as a percentage of our total net sales for fiscal years fiscal year category private label footwear branded footwear accessories total planning and allocation 
we have developed a micro merchandising strategy for each of our bakers stores through market research and sales experience 
we maintain the level and type of styles demanded by subsets of our target customers 
we have categorized each of our bakers stores as being predominantly a mainstream  fashion or urban location  and if appropriate we identify subcategories for certain stores 
we have implemented a similar micro merchandising strategy for our wild pair stores 

table of contents our micro merchandising strategy of classifying multiple stores and merchandising them similarly based upon customer demographics enables our merchants to provide an appropriate merchandise mix in order to meet that particular store s customers casual  weekend club  career and special occasion needs 
in determining the appropriate merchandise mix and inventory levels for a particular store  among other factors  we consider selling history  importance of branded footwear  importance of accessories  importance of aggressive fashion  the stock capacity of the store  sizing trends and color preferences 
our merchandising plan includes sales  inventory and profitability targets for each product classification 
this plan is reconciled with our store sales plan  a compilation of individual store sales projections that is developed semi annually  but reforecasted monthly 
we also update the merchandising plan on a monthly basis to reflect current sales and inventory trends 
the plan is then distributed throughout the merchandising department  which analyzes trends on a weekly  and sometimes daily  basis 
we use the reforecasted merchandising plan to adjust production orders as needed to meet inventory and sales targets 
this process helps to control our inventory levels and markdowns 
our buyers typically order merchandise to days in advance of anticipated delivery 
this strategy allows us to react to both the positive and negative trends and customer preferences identified through our information systems and other tracking procedures 
through this purchasing strategy  we can take advantage of positive trends by quickly replenishing our inventory of popular products 
this strategy can also reduce our exposure to risk because we are less likely to be overstocked with less desirable items 
clearance 
we utilize clearance and markdown procedures to reduce our inventory of slower moving styles 
our management monitors pricing and markdowns to facilitate the introduction of new merchandise and to maintain the freshness of our fashion image 
we have five clearance sales each year  which coincide with the end of a particular selling season 
for more information regarding our selling seasons  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
you should also refer to seasonality and to risk factors our overall profitability is highly dependent upon our fourth quarter results 
during a clearance sale  we instruct our stores to systematically lower the price of the items  and if not sold  to ship them to one of our to stores which have special clearance sections 
we believe that our test and react strategy and our monitoring of inventories and consumer buying trends help us to reduce sales at clearance prices 
stores store locations and environment 
our stores are designed to attract customers who are intrigued by a young and contemporary lifestyle and to create an inviting  exciting atmosphere in which it is fun for them to shop in locations where they want to shop 
our stores average approximately  square feet and are primarily located in regional shopping malls 
as of february   six of our stores  which are located in dense urban markets such as new york city and chicago  have freestanding street locations 
we believe that we are also able to operate in a wide range of shopping mall classifications 
as a result  we continue to operate a number of our stores that may not merit the same level of investment as our new format stores but that generate a reasonable return on investment 
our stores create a clean  upscale boutique environment  featuring contemporary finishings and sophisticated details 
glass exteriors allow passersby to see easily into the store from the high visibility  high traffic locations in the malls where we have located most of our stores 
the open floor design allows customers to readily view the majority of the merchandise on display while store fixtures allow for the efficient display of accessories 
our customers use cash  checks and third party credit cards to purchase our products 
we do not issue private credit cards or make use of complicated financing arrangements

store concepts 
as of february   we operated bakers stores and wild pair stores 
as of april   we operated stores including wild pair stores 
our bakers stores focus on widely accepted  mainstream fashion and provide a fun  high energy shopping environment geared toward young women between the ages of and our wild pair stores feature fashion forward merchandise for hip young women and men between the ages of and and reflect the attitude and lifestyle of this demographic niche 
the wild pair customer demands edgier  faster fashion that exists further towards the leading edge than does the typical bakers customer  which allows us to better monitor the direction of the fashion forward look that our bakers customer will be seeking 
to match the attitude of our wild pair merchandise  we have created a fast  fun  environment within our wild pair stores 

table of contents wild pair stores carry a higher proportion of branded merchandise  which generally sells at higher price points than our bakers footwear 
the following table compares our bakers and wild pair formats bakers wild pair target customer women ages men women ages private label sales branded sales fashion content widely accepted edgy  lifestyle based approximate average store size  square feet  square feet store operations 
our store operations are organized into four divisions  east  south  midwest  and west  which are subdivided into regions 
each region is managed by a regional manager  who is typically responsible for to stores 
each store is typically staffed with a manager and an assistant manager  in addition to approximately five part time sales associates 
in some markets where stores are more closely located  one of the store managers may also act as an area manager for the stores in that area  assisting the regional manager for those stores 
our regional managers are primarily responsible for the operation and results of the stores in their region  including the hiring or promotion of store managers 
we develop new store managers by promoting from within and selectively hiring from other retail organizations 
our store managers are primarily responsible for sales results  hiring and training store level staff  payroll control and shortage control 
merchandise selections  inventory management and visual merchandising strategies for each store are largely determined at the corporate level and are communicated by email to the stores generally on a weekly basis 
our commitment to customer satisfaction and service is an integral part of building customer loyalty 
we seek to instill enthusiasm and dedication in our store management personnel and sales associates through incentive programs and regular communication with the stores 
sales associates receive commissions on sales with a guaranteed minimum hourly compensation 
we run various sales contests to encourage our sales associates to maximize sales volume 
store managers receive base compensation plus incentive compensation based on sales and inventory control 
regional and area managers receive base compensation plus incentive compensation based on meeting profitability benchmarks 
each of our managers controls the payroll hours in conjunction with a weekly budget provided by the regional manager 
we have well established store operating policies and procedures and use an in store training regimen for all store employees 
on a regular basis  our merchandising staff provide the stores with merchandise presentation instructions  which include diagrams and photographs of fixture presentations 
in addition  our internal newsletter provides product descriptions  sales histories and other milestone information to sales associates to enable them to gain familiarity with our product offerings and our business 
we offer our sales associates a discount on our merchandise to encourage them to wear our merchandise and to reflect our lifestyle image both on and off the selling floor 
our regional managers are responsible for maintaining a loss prevention program in each of our stores 
in addition  we have a loss prevention department with regional loss prevention staff who perform individual store visits throughout the year 
our loss prevention efforts also include monitoring returns  voided transactions  employee sales and deposits  using software to analyze transactions recorded in our point of sale system  as well as educating our store personnel on loss prevention 
we track inventory through electronic receipt acknowledgment to better monitor loss prevention factors  which allows us to identify variances and further to reduce our losses due to damage  theft or other reasons 
sourcing and distribution a key factor in our ability to offer our merchandise at moderate prices and respond quickly to changes in consumer trends is our sourcing ability 
we source each of our private label product lines separately based on the 
table of contents individual design  styling and quality specifications of those products 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and rely primarily on third party foreign manufacturers in china  brazil  italy  spain and other countries for the production of our private label merchandise 
our buying agents have relationships with these manufacturers and generally have been successful in minimizing the lead times for sourcing merchandise 
these relationships have allowed us to work very close to our expected delivery dates 
in addition  our test and react strategy supported by these strong relationships with manufacturers allows our merchandising and buying teams to test new styles and react quickly to fashion trends  while keeping fast moving inventory in stock 
for more information about risks associated with the foreign sourcing of our products  you should refer to risk factors our merchandise is manufactured by foreign manufacturers  therefore  the availability and costs of our products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade and risk factors our reliance on manufacturers in china exposes us to supply risks 
we believe that this sourcing of footwear products and our short lead times reduce our working capital investment and inventory risk  and enables more efficient and timely introduction of new product designs 
we have not entered into any long term manufacturing or supply contracts 
we believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products 
the principal materials used in the manufacture of our footwear and accessory merchandise are available from numerous domestic and international sources 
management  or our agents  perform an array of quality control inspection procedures at stages in the production process  including examination and testing of prototypes of key products prior to manufacture  samples and materials prior to production and final products prior to shipment 
substantially all merchandise for our stores is initially received  inspected  processed and distributed through one of our two distribution centers  each of which is part of a third party warehousing system 
merchandise that is manufactured in asia is delivered to our west coast distribution center located in los angeles  california and merchandise manufactured elsewhere in the world is delivered to our east coast distribution center located near philadelphia  pennsylvania 
in accordance with our micro merchandising strategy  our allocation teams determine how the product should be distributed among the stores based on current inventory levels  sales trends  specific product characteristics and the buyers input 
merchandise typically is shipped to the stores as soon as possible after receipt in our distribution centers using third party carriers  and any goods not shipped to stores are shipped to our warehouse facility in st 
louis  missouri for replenishment purposes 
we also fulfill our internet store and catalog sales from our st 
louis facility 
information systems and technology our information systems integrate our individual stores  merchandising  distribution and financial systems 
daily sales and cash deposit information is electronically collected from the stores point of sale terminals nightly 
this allows management to make timely decisions in response to market conditions 
these include decisions about pricing  markdowns  reorders and inventory management 
our arthur allocation system in conjunction with our point of sale systems allows us to better execute our micro merchandising strategy through efficient management and allocation of our store inventories 
these systems allow us to reduce our response times in reaction to fashion trends and allow us to identify and reduce our losses due to damage  theft or other reasons  and to improve monitoring of employee productivity 
our micro merchandising strategy requires us to adapt the merchandise mix by location  with different assortments depending on store level customer demographics 
we have the capability to constantly monitor inventory levels and purchases by store  enabling us to manage our merchandise mix 
we believe that effective use of our systems allow us to manage our exposure to markdowns 
we believe that our systems facilitate the process of controlling inventory commitments in light of changes in consumer demand 
we believe that our buyers and inventory management team are able to efficiently adjust our store inventory levels to effectively control excess inventory and markdowns 
marketing and advertising starting in fiscal year  we have been mailing the bakers catalog to existing and prospective customers 
we believe that the catalog allows us to broaden our appeal by showcasing our stylish image and upscale offerings 

table of contents we anticipate issuing three catalogs during fiscal year  with an average mailing of approximately  copies 
we believe that our catalogs provide an additional channel for our customers to purchase our merchandise and will increase traffic at our internet store and our mall stores 
our marketing also includes an in store  high impact  visual advertising campaign 
marketing materials are particularly positioned to exploit our high visibility  high traffic mall locations 
banners in our windows and signage on our walls and tables may highlight a particular fashion story  a seasonal theme or a featured piece of merchandise 
we utilize promotional giveaways or promotional event marketing 
every three weeks  we provide the stores with specific merchandise display directions from the corporate office 
our in store product presentation utilizes a variety of different fixtures to highlight the breadth of our product line 
various fashion themes are displayed throughout the store utilizing combinations of styles and colors 
to cultivate brand loyalty  we offer our frequent buying card  the b card 
this program currently allows our customers to purchase a b card for and receive a discount on most purchases for a twelve month period 
we believe that this program strengthens customer loyalty 
we also market to customers who have provided us with their e mail addresses via web bursts  e mail messages from bakers announcing new product offerings and promotions 
competition we believe that our bakers stores have no direct national competitors who specialize in full service  moderate priced fashion footwear for young women 
yet  the footwear and accessories retail industry is highly competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
competitive factors in our industry include brand name recognition  product styling  product quality  product presentation  product pricing  store ambiance  customer service  and convenience 
we believe that we match or surpass our competitors on the competitive factors that matter most to our target customer 
we offer the convenience of being located in high traffic  high visibility locations within the shopping malls in which our customer prefers to shop 
we have a focused strategy on our target customer that offers her the fun store atmosphere  full service and style that she desires 
several types of competitors vie for our target customer department stores such as bloomingdale s  macy s  dillard s and kohl s  national branded wholesalers such as nine west  steve madden and vans  national branded off price retailers such as dsw  rack room and shoe carnival  national specialty retailers such as finish line  journey s  naturalizer and aldo s  regional chains such as cathy jean and sheik  discount stores such as wal mart  target and k mart  and  to a lesser extent  apparel retailers such as bebe  charlotte russe  rampage and wet seal 
department stores generally are not located within the interior of the mall where our target customer prefers to shop with her friends 
national branded wholesalers generally have a narrower line of footwear with higher average price points and target a more narrowly focused customer 
specialty retailers also cater to a different demographic than our target customer 
regional chains generally do not offer the depth of private label merchandise that we offer 
national branded off price retailers and discount stores do not provide the same level of fashion or customer service 
apparel retailers  if they sell shoes or accessories  generally offer a narrow line of styles  which can encourage a customer to come to our store to purchase shoes or accessories to complement her new outfit 
our competitors sell a broad assortment of footwear and accessories that are similar and sometimes identical to those we sell  and at times may be able to provide comparable merchandise at lower prices 
while each of these different distribution channels may be able to compete with us on fashion  value or service  we believe that none of them can successfully match or surpass us on all three of these elements 

table of contents our wild pair stores compete on most of the same factors as bakers 
however  due to wild pair s market position  it is subject to more intense competition from national specialty retailers and national branded wholesalers 
history of bakers shoe stores the first bakers shoe store opened in atlanta  georgia  in bakers grew to be one of the nation s largest women s moderately priced specialty fashion footwear retailers 
at its peak in  bakers had grown to approximately stores 
at that time  it was one of several footwear  apparel and entertainment retail specialty chains that were owned and operated by edison brothers  which in had over  stores in the united states  puerto rico  the virgin islands  mexico and canada 
edison brothers filed a petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on november  after an unsuccessful reorganization  edison brothers refiled for bankruptcy on march   and immediately commenced a liquidation of all its assets 
in june  we purchased selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains  approximately store locations and inventory  from edison brothers stores  inc we retained the majority of bakers employees and key senior management  merchandise buyers  store operating personnel and administrative support personnel 
subsequently  we closed or re merchandised our prior stores into the bakers or wild pair formats 
employees as of april   we employed approximately full time and  part time employees with approximately of our employees at our corporate offices and warehouse  and  employees at our store locations 
the number of part time employees fluctuates depending on our seasonal needs 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
properties all of our stores are located in the united states 
we lease all of our store locations 
most of our leases have an initial term of approximately ten years 
in addition  leases typically require us to pay property taxes  utilities  repairs  maintenance  common area maintenance and  in some instances  merchant association fees 
some of our leases also require contingent rent based on sales 
we lease approximately  square feet for our headquarters  located at scott avenue  st 
louis  missouri the lease has approximately nine years remaining 
we also lease an approximately  square foot warehouse in st 
louis with a remaining lease term of approximately eight years 
intellectual property and proprietary rights we acquired the right and title to several trademarks in connection with the bakers acquisition  including our trademarks bakers tm and wild pair 
in addition  we currently have several applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office for additional registrations 
for more information on our trademarks  please see risk factors our ability to expand into some territorial and foreign jurisdictions under the trademarks bakers and wild pair is restricted and risk factors our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names below 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal 
we have five principal selling seasons transition post holiday  easter  back to school  fall and holiday 
our fourth quarter sales volume tends to be significantly higher than our other quarters because our product offering during the holiday season tends to include our higher price point merchandise such as boots and customer traffic tends to be substantially higher during the holiday season 
consequently  we achieve our greatest leverage on fixed expenses and can generate our highest profit margin levels during the fourth quarter 
we have two of our five clearance sales during the third quarter and  consequently  we achieve our least leverage on fixed expenses and generate our lowest profit levels during the third quarter 
our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year  increasing prior to peak shopping seasons as we increase inventory levels to meet anticipated peak demand 
you should also refer to risk factors our overall profitability is highly dependent

risk factors our failure to identify and respond to changing consumer fashion preferences in a timely manner would negatively impact our sales  profitability  liquidity and our image as a fashion resource for our customers 
the footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer fashion preferences 
our sales  net income and liquidity are sensitive to these changing preferences  which can be rapid and dramatic 
accordingly  we must identify and interpret fashion trends and respond in a timely manner 
we continually market new styles of footwear  but demand for and market acceptance of these new styles are uncertain 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales  higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories  lower gross profits and negatively impact our financial liquidity 
conversely  if we fail to anticipate consumer demand for our products  we may experience inventory shortages  which would result in lost sales and could negatively impact our customer goodwill  our brand image and our profitability 
moreover  our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences 
stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories 
for example  in fiscal year and fiscal year  our product offerings did not adequately reflect changes in consumer fashion trends  primarily sandals in the spring and for boots in the fall  which negatively impacted sales and profitability see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if our sales trends do not improve  we could fail to maintain a liquidity position adequate to support our ongoing operations 
our comparable store sales for fiscal year and fiscal year decreased and  respectively 
our comparable stores sales for the first two months of fiscal year were down compared to the same period in fiscal year this decline in sales has resulted in net losses of million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively  and has negatively impacted our liquidity and financial position 
at february  we had negative working capital of million  unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and our shareholders equity had declined to million 
in the past  as a result of low levels of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  we have sought additional sources of liquidity 
should this negative sales trend continue through the remainder of fiscal year  or if we were to incur significant unplanned cash outlays  it would become necessary for us to obtain additional sources of liquidity  or take additional cost cutting measures 
in addition  these sales trends could result in our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our three year subordinated secured term loan 
any future financing may be subject to our financial results  market conditions and the consent of our lenders and we may not be able to obtain additional financing 
alternatively  we may only be able to obtain such financing on terms that are substantially dilutive to our current shareholders and that may further restrict our business activities 
if we cannot obtain needed financing or if we fail to comply with our financial covenants  our operations may be materially negatively impacted and we may be forced into bankruptcy or to cease operations and you could lose your investment in the company 
the terms of our three year subordinated secured term loan contain certain financial covenants with respect to our performance and other covenants that restrict our activities 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  the lender could accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness and subject us to a cross default under our credit facility 
our three year subordinated secured term loan contains certain financial covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth both as defined in the loan agreement each fiscal quarter and annual limits on capital expenditures of no more than million  million and million  respectively 
we are also subject to restrictive covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to pre pay other indebtedness  to dispose of assets  to effect certain corporate transactions  including specified mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  to change the nature of our business  to pay dividends other than in the form of common stock dividends  as well as covenants that limit transactions with affiliates and prohibit a change of control as defined in the loan agreement 
the loan agreement generally provides for customary events of default  including default in the payment of principal or interest or other required payments  failure to observe or perform covenants or agreements contained in the transaction documents subject to certain limited exceptions  materially breaching our senior credit facility or the terms of our subordinated convertible debentures  generally failure to pay when due debt obligations broadly defined  subject to certain exceptions in excess of million  specified events of bankruptcy or specified judgments against us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants 
in light of our recent sales results and the current state of the economy  we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we may not be able to comply with our minimum adjusted ebitda covenant 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the term loan  the lender will be entitled to acceleration of the debt plus all accrued and unpaid interest  subject to a senior subordination agreement that was entered into with bank of america  na  with the interest rate increasing to per annum 
defaults under our term loan could also result in cross acceleration of our senior credit facility and our subordinated convertible debentures 
if an event of default occurs under the term loan  we may be unable to negotiate a mutually acceptable modification of the loan with the lender and we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders under the senior secured credit facility and subordinated secured term loan could proceed against the collateral securing the loan 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 

table of contents the report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our fiscal year financial statements contains language expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended february   states that our recent losses and our potential inability to comply with financial covenants raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset and liability amounts that might be necessary if we cease to function as a going concern 
see note to our financial statements 
this audit report could adversely affect our relationships with our landlords  our suppliers  our ability to raise additional capital and to execute our business plan  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  if we cease to function as a going concern you may lose your investment in the company 
our operations could be constrained by our ability to obtain funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
our business is seasonal  with a substantial portion of our profitability and cash flow occurring during our fourth quarter 
we rely on draws from our revolving credit facility to fund seasonal working capital requirements during the first three quarters of our year 
draws on our credit facility are limited by both an overall limit of million and also by a calculated borrowing base that varies according to a formula based on inventory and accounts receivable and is generally less than the million overall limit 
as of february   we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility of million and unused borrowing capacity  calculated in accordance with the agreement  of million 
as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million and unused borrowing capacity of million 
to the extent we were to fail to generate sufficient cash from operating activities or from other financing activities  we could encounter availability constraints related to our operating activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
a decline in general economic conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our footwear and accessories and could lead to reduced sales 
in addition to consumer fashion preferences  consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  gas prices  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
our overall profitability is highly dependent upon our fourth quarter results 
our fourth quarter sales volume tends to be significantly higher than our other quarters because our product offering during the holiday season tends to include our higher price point merchandise such as boots and customer traffic tends to be substantially higher during the holiday season 
consequently  we achieve our greatest leverage on fixed expenses and generate our highest profit levels during the fourth quarter 
should our product offerings not meet with customer acceptance during the fourth quarter  it would have a substantial negative impact on the overall results for the year 
our operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations that can impact our profitability and liquidity 
in addition to customer shopping patterns  our quarterly results are affected by a variety of other factors  including fashion trends  the effectiveness of our inventory management  changes in our merchandise mix  
table of contents weather conditions  changes in general economic conditions  and actions of competitors  mall anchor stores or co tenants 
due to factors such as these  our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  net income for each of the first three quarters of fiscal year was substantially less than for the comparable quarters of fiscal year for more information  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations 
we are subject to risks associated with leasing our stores  including those stores where we acquired the lease through bankruptcy auctions 
we lease our store locations under individual leases 
approximately one half of our stores are located in properties managed by two national property management companies 
a number of our leases include termination and default provisions which apply if we do not meet certain sales levels  specified dilution in or changes of ownership of our company occur  or in other circumstances 
in addition  our leases subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters 
moreover  each year a significant portion of our leases are subject to renewal or termination 
if one or more of our landlords decides to terminate our leases  or to not allow us to renew  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we initially acquired many of our current leases from edison brothers  as debtor in possession  or from other bankrupt entities through auctions in which a bankruptcy court ordered the assignment of the debtor s interest in the leases to us 
as a result  we have not separately negotiated many of our leases  which are generally drafted in favor of the landlord 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of competitors  including national branded wholesalers  national specialty retailers  regional chains  national branded off price retailers  traditional department stores  discounters and apparel retailers 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
our market share and results of operations could be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors or the introduction of new competitors 
for more information about our competition  please see business competition 
the departure of members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business depends upon our senior management closely supervising all aspects of our business  in particular  the operation of our stores and the design  procurement and allocation of our merchandise 
retention of senior management is especially important in our business due to the limited availability of experienced and talented retail executives 
if we were to lose the services of peter edison  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  or other members of our senior management  our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to employ a suitable replacement in a timely manner 
our failure to maintain good relationships with our manufacturers could harm our ability to procure quality inventory in a timely manner 
our ability to obtain attractive pricing  quick response  ordering flexibility and other terms from our manufacturers depends on their perception of us and our buying agents 
we do not own any production facilities or have any long term contracts with any manufacturers  and we typically order our inventory through purchase orders 
any disruption in our supply chain could quickly impact our sales 
our failure or the failure of our buying agents to maintain good relationships with these manufacturers could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
it is possible that we could be unable to acquire sufficient quantities or an appropriate mix of merchandise or raw materials at acceptable prices 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to 
table of contents conform to our quality control standards 
in this event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we are also subject to risks related to the availability and use of materials and manufacturing processes for our products  including those which some may find objectionable 
we rely on a small number of buying agents and private label vendors for a substantial portion our merchandise purchases  and our failure to maintain good relationships with any of them could harm our ability to source our products 
for fiscal year  five buying agents private label vendors accounted for approximately of our merchandise purchases  with one private label vendor accounting for approximately of our merchandise purchases 
our buying agents and private label vendors assist in developing our private label merchandise  arrange for the purchase of necessary materials and contract with manufacturers 
we execute nonexclusive agreements with some of our buying agents 
these agreements prohibit our buying agents from sharing commissions with manufacturers  owning stock or holding any ownership interest in  or being owned in any way by  any of our manufacturers or suppliers 
the agreements do not prohibit our buying agents from acting as agents for other purchasers  which could negatively impact our sales 
if they were to disclose our plans or designs to our competitors  our sales may be materially adversely impacted 
the loss of any of these key buying agents or a breach by them of our buying agent agreements could adversely affect our ability to develop or obtain merchandise 
our merchandise is manufactured by foreign manufacturers  therefore  the availability and costs of our products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade 
although all of our stores are located in the united states  virtually all of our merchandise is produced in china  brazil  italy  spain and other foreign countries 
therefore  we are subject to the risks associated with international trade  which include adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import tariffs  duties or quotas  the imposition of taxes or other charges on imports  the imposition of restrictive trade policies or sanctions by the united states on one or more of the countries from which we obtain footwear and accessories  expropriation or nationalization  compliance with and changes in import restrictions and regulations  exposure to different legal standards and the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and changing foreign government policies  international hostilities  war or terrorism  changes in foreign governments  regulations  political unrest  work stoppages  shipment disruption or delays  and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our manufacturers and suppliers are located 
our imported products are subject to united states customs duties  which make up a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
if customs duties are substantially increased  it would harm our profitability 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced may impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty  or tariff levels  any of which could have a harmful effect on our profitability 
furthermore  when declaring the duties owed on and the classifications of our imported products  we make various good faith assumptions 
we regularly employ a third party to review our customs declarations  and we will notify the appropriate authorities if any erroneous declarations are revealed 
however  the customs authorities retain the right to audit our declarations  which could result in additional tariffs  duties and or penalties if the authorities believe that they have discovered any errors 

table of contents continued decline in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies  especially the chinese yuan could negatively impact our gross margins 
during fiscal year and continuing into fiscal year  the value of the united states dollar has declined relative to the chinese yuan 
although our inventory purchase transactions are denominated in united states dollars which eliminates exchange rate risks on established contracts  the decline in the value of the united states dollar has resulted in increases in the costs of our chinese sourced products 
in the event of a continued decline in the united states dollar or economy  it may mot be possible for us to increase or maintain an increase in our average selling prices sufficient to fully or partially reflect these cost increases 
to the extent that we are unable to offset such cost increases there would be a negative impact on our gross margins 
our reliance on manufacturers in china exposes us to supply risks 
manufacturing facilities in china produce a significant portion of our products 
generally  a substantial majority of our private label footwear units are manufactured in china and virtually all of our private label accessories are manufactured in china each year 
the chinese economy is subject to periodic energy and labor shortages  as well as transportation and shipping bottlenecks 
in prior years  there have been delays at ports on the west coast of the united states 
these matters  changes in the chinese government or economy  or the current tariff or duty structures or adoption by the united states of trade polices or sanctions adverse to china  could harm our ability to obtain inventory in a timely and cost effective manner 
our ability to expand into some territorial and foreign jurisdictions under the trademarks bakers and wild pair is restricted 
when we acquired selected assets of the bakers and wild pair chains from edison brothers stores  inc in a bankruptcy auction in june  we were assigned title to and the right to use the trademarks bakers  the wild pair  wild pair and other trademarks to the extent owned by edison brothers at that time 
our rights to use the trademarks are subject to a concurrent use agreement which recognizes the geographical division of the trademarks between us and a puerto rican company 
at approximately the same time as we acquired our rights and title  edison brothers also assigned to the puerto rican company title to and the right to use the trademarks  subject to the concurrent use agreement 
under the concurrent use agreement  we and the puerto rican company agree that the puerto rican company has the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the commonwealth of puerto rico  the us virgin islands  central and south america  cuba  the dominican republic  the bahamas  the lesser antilles and jamaica and that we have the exclusive right to use the trademarks in the united states and throughout the world  except for the territories and jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company was assigned the rights 
consequently  we do not have the right to use the trademarks bakers and wild pair in those territories and foreign jurisdictions in which the puerto rican company owns the trademark rights  which may limit our growth 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names 
because the trademarks assigned to us by edison brothers are subject to the concurrent use agreement  the us trademark applications and registrations are jointly owned by us and a puerto rican company  which could impair our ability to renew and enforce the assigned applications and registrations 
simultaneously with the puerto rican company  we have filed separate concurrent use applications for the bakers and wild pair trademarks  and we have requested that existing applications for the trademark bakers also be divided territorially 
while we are in agreement with the puerto rican company that confusion is not likely to result from concurrent use of the trademarks in our respective territories  the united states patent and trademark office may not agree with our position 
if we are not able to register or renew our trademark registrations  our ability to prevent others from using trademarks and to capitalize on the value of our brand names may be impaired 
further  our rights in the trademarks could be subject to security interests granted by the puerto rican company 
our potential inability or failure to renew  register or otherwise protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could negatively impact the value of our brand names 

table of contents we would be adversely affected if our distribution operations were disrupted 
the efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute merchandise manufactured overseas to locations throughout the united states in a timely manner 
we depend on third parties to ship  receive and distribute substantially all of our merchandise 
a third party operating in china manages the shipping of merchandise from china either to a third party operating our los angeles  california distribution center or for delivery directly to our stores through los angeles 
the third party in los angeles  california accepts delivery of a significant portion of our merchandise from asia  and another third party near philadelphia  pennsylvania accepts delivery of our merchandise from elsewhere 
these parties located in the united states have provided these services to us pursuant to written agreements since and one of these agreements is terminable upon days notice 
we also continue to operate under the terms of an expired agreement with the remaining third party 
merchandise not shipped to our stores is shipped to our company operated warehouse 
we also rely on our computer network to coordinate the distribution of our products 
if we need to replace one of our third party service providers  if our warehouse or computer network is shut down for any reason or does not operate efficiently  our operations could be disrupted for a substantial period of time while we identify and integrate a replacement into our system 
any such disruption could materially negatively impact our ability to maintain sufficient inventory in our stores and consequently our profitability 
we may be subject to liability under our registration statements 
we currently have three registration statements relating to our incentive plans and two selling shareholder registration statements in effect  including a registration statement relating to the common stock sold and common stock underlying the warrants issued in our april private placement and the common stock underlying the warrants issued in our initial public offering 
we entered into a registration rights agreement with the lender under our three year subordinated secured term loan whereby we agreed to register  shares of our common stock that were issued to the lender as additional consideration for the loan 
under this registration rights agreement  we may be subject to liquidated damages penalties through february  equal to of the value of the registrable shares remaining based on an aggregate value of  for each day period prorated for partial periods if i the registration statement is not filed with the sec by the earlier of days of february  and five business days of the company s filing of its annual report on form k for fiscal year  ii the registration statement if not declared effective by the sec within days after february   iii the registration statement ceases to be effective for more than days per year or more than consecutive calendar days  subject to our right to suspend use of the registration statement for certain periods of time in certain circumstances  or iv if our common stock ceases to be traded on an eligible market 
our credit facility restricts our activities 
we have a million secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na we routinely depend on our credit facility and may use a large percentage of the facility to fund our inventory purchases and our capital expenditures  especially prior to our selling seasons 
our credit facility includes financial and other customary covenants which  among other things  restrict our business activities and our ability to incur debt  make acquisitions and pay dividends 
a change in control of our company  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  is also prohibited 
in the event that we were to violate any of the covenants in our credit facility  or if other indebtedness in excess of million could be accelerated  or in the event that or more of our leases could be terminated other than solely as a result of certain sales of our common stock  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets 
effective august   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement which  among other things  extended its maturity date to august  for more information about our credit facility  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents the market price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock is expected to be highly volatile  both because of actual and perceived changes in our financial results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include  among other factors discussed in this section  the following actual or anticipated variations in comparable store sales or operating results  changes in financial estimates by research analysts  actual or anticipated changes in the united states economy or the retailing environment  changes in the market valuations of other footwear or retail companies  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures  financing transactions  securities offerings or other strategic initiatives 
we are controlled by a small group of shareholders whose interests may differ from other shareholders 
a significant portion of our stock ownership is concentrated among a relatively small number of mutual funds and hedge funds whose interests may differ from our other shareholders or could impact our company including any potential change of control 
mr 
edison and members of his family and our current management are also among our largest shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders will continue to have significant influence in determining the outcome of all matters submitted to shareholders for approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders  and their concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that may be favored by other shareholders 
as long as these people are among our principal shareholders  they will have the power to significantly influence the election of our entire board of directors 
peter edison s employment agreement entitles him to a one time payment equal to three times his current base salary as defined in the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events  including following a change of control of the company if there is generally a material reduction in the nature of his duties or his base salary  or he is not allowed to participate in certain bonus plans 
for this purpose  a change of control generally includes the acquisition by a person or group of more of our common stock than that held by peter edison 
more than one of our shareholders has filed a schedule d or g reporting beneficial ownership in an amount in excess of that beneficially owned by peter edison and our current management 
the public sale of our common stock by selling shareholders could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of market sales by our shareholders  including under our resale registration statements  or the perception that these sales will occur 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
there is relatively limited trading in our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock is relatively limited  which we expect to continue 
therefore  our stock may be subject to higher volatility or illiquidity than would exist if our shares were traded more actively 
our charter documents and missouri law may inhibit a takeover  which may cause a decline in the value of our stock 
provisions of our restated articles of incorporation  our restated bylaws and missouri law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if closing the transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders 
for example  our restated articles of incorporation provide  in part  that directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause and by the affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of our outstanding shares and that vacancies may be filled only by a majority of remaining directors 
under our restated bylaws  shareholders must follow detailed notice and other requirements to nominate a candidate for director or to make shareholder proposals 

table of contents in addition  among other requirements  our restated bylaws require at least a two thirds vote of shareholders to call a special meeting 
moreover  missouri law and our bylaws provide that any action by written consent must be unanimous 
furthermore  our bylaws may be amended only by our board of directors 
certain amendments to our articles of incorporation require the vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares in certain circumstances  including the provisions of our articles of incorporation relating to business combinations  directors  bylaws  limitations on director liabilities and amendments to our articles of incorporation 
we are also generally subject to the business combination provisions under missouri law  which allow our board of directors to retain discretion over the approval of certain business combinations 
in our bylaws  we have elected to not be subject to the control shares acquisition provision under missouri law  which would deny an acquiror voting rights with respect to any shares of voting stock which increase its equity ownership to more than specified thresholds 
these and other provisions of missouri law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws  peter edison s substantial beneficial ownership position  our board s authority to issue preferred stock and the lack of cumulative voting in our articles of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board or otherwise to bring a matter before shareholders without our board s consent 
such items may reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited takeover proposal and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

through january   we elected s corporation status for federal and state income tax purposes 
accordingly  for the year ended january   no provision was made for federal or certain state income taxes 
pro forma net income has been computed as if we had been fully subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
effective january   we terminated our s election and became taxable as a c corporation 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reflected the net impact of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities as of the date of conversion as a component of our provision for income taxes for fiscal year this resulted in the recognition of a nonrecurring income tax benefit of approximately million 
as an s corporation  we paid distributions to our shareholders in amounts sufficient to allow them to pay income taxes related to an allocable share of our taxable income and did not pay traditional cash dividends per share 
such distributions are not comparable to dividends that would be paid by a c corporation 
on february   we consummated our initial public offering with the sale of  shares of common stock 
on march   we sold an additional  shares of common stock in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of the full over allotment option 
all of the shares of common stock sold to the public were sold at per share 
the aggregate gross proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds received from the initial public offering to repay million on our revolving credit agreement  million to redeem outstanding warrants  million to repay subordinated debt and million for capital expenditures 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  we had three classes of common stock authorized  class a common stock  class b common stock and class c common stock  of which only shares of class a and class b common stock were outstanding 
upon the consummation of our initial public offering  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock on a for basis  excluding fractional shares 
mandatory redemption rights in favor of certain holders of prior class a and class b common stock were also terminated 
in addition  upon the consummation of our initial public offering  million in aggregate principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures due were automatically converted into  shares of our common stock 
further  in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  we sold to the representatives of the underwriters and their designees warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  subject to antidilution adjustments  for a purchase price of per warrant 
on march   we changed our fiscal year to the saturday closest to january previously our fiscal year ended four weeks earlier 
as a result of this change  we had a four week transition period ended january  we believe that the change in our fiscal year end does not impact the comparability of the five fiscal years presented in this table 
for the four week transition period ended january   net sales were  gross profit was  loss before income taxes was  benefit from income taxes was  net loss was  and net loss per common share on both a basic and diluted basis was

the net proceeds after placement fees and expenses were  we used the proceeds to finance new store expansion and remodel existing stores into our new format 
we base our fiscal year on a week period 
the fiscal year ended february  was a week period 
for more information regarding our fiscal year  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
on january   we adopted sfas no

during fiscal year we recognized  in noncash charges related to the impairment of long lived assets of underperforming stores  including three prototype stores we determined were no longer consistent with our strategic focus 
during fiscal year  the company s pretax losses exceeded the company s operating loss carryback potential 
therefore  the company concluded that the realizability of net deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not  and established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets

the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item business cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors and item business risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by this more detailed information and our financial statements and the related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a national  mall based  specialty retailer of distinctive footwear and accessories targeting young women who demand quality fashion products 
we feature private label and national brand dress  casual and sport shoes  boots  sandals and accessories 
as of february   we operated stores  including the store wild pair chain that targets men and women between the ages of and who desire edgier  fashion forward footwear 
as of april  we operated stores  including wild pair stores 
we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of a decline in net sales  a drop in comparable store sales and a decrease in gross margin dollars 
demand for our spring and fall product lines was much weaker than anticipated  resulting in excessive inventory levels in the third quarter 
in order to address this situation  in september we announced a realignment of top management  an million cost reduction plan  and a change in our merchandising and inventory focus 
we took significant pricing actions to facilitate the reduction of our inventory levels  which reduced gross margin in fiscal year  but resulted in a decrease in inventory at the end of fiscal year compared to the end of fiscal year these losses had a significant negative impact on our financial position and liquidity 
as of february   we had negative working capital of million  unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and our shareholders equity had declined to million 
during fiscal year  we addressed our liquidity issues by amending our revolving line of credit agreement to provide for additional availability from april through september  raising million in net proceeds from issuing million of subordinated convertible debentures in june  and terminating a long term below market lease in exchange for receiving a million cash payment in december in addition  in february  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we obtained net proceeds of million from the entry into a million three year subordinated secured term loan and the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
as of april   the balance on our revolving line of credit was million and our unused borrowing capacity was million 

table of contents our business plan for the remainder of fiscal year is based on moderate increases in comparable store sales beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the remainder of the year 
our business plan also reflects improved inventory management  with planned inventory levels down approximately compared to prior year inventory levels through the third quarter 
we are placing greater focus on our core lines and on timely promotional activity 
we believe that this increased focus on inventory should improve our overall gross margin performance compared to fiscal year we also believe that our gross margin performance will benefit from the realization of the portion of our million cost reduction plan that relates to cost of merchandise sold  occupancy  and buying expenses 
likewise  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to benefit from cost reductions 
we have limited our planned capital expenditures for fiscal year to opening two new stores and remodeling two stores 
however  we can give no assurance that we will meet the sales or margin levels contemplated in our business plan 
we continue to face considerable liquidity constraints  which were exacerbated by continued soft sales during february and march in which our comparable store sales decreased 
fiscal april comparable store sales through may were flat and have returned to levels consistent with our business plan  under which we expect to maintain adequate levels of liquidity for the remainder of fiscal year although we believe our business plan is achievable  should we fail to achieve the sales or gross margin levels we anticipate  or if we were to incur significant unplanned cash outlays  it would become necessary for us to obtain additional sources of liquidity or make further cost cuts to fund our operations 
however  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  or to successfully further reduce costs in such a way that would continue to allow us to operate our business 
see item business risk factors if our sales trends do not improve  we could fail to maintain a liquidity position adequate to support our ongoing operations herein 
our million three year subordinated secured term loan includes certain financial covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth each fiscal quarter and provides for annual limits on capital expenditures all as calculated in accordance with the loan agreement 
based on our business plan for the remainder of the year and our other actions  we believe that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants 
however  given the inherent volatility in our sales performance  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
furthermore  in light of our recent sales results and the current state of the economy  we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we may not be able to comply with our minimum adjusted ebitda covenant 
failure to comply would be a default under the terms of our term loan and could result in the acceleration of our term loan  and possibly all of our debt obligations 
if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants  we will be required to seek one or more amendments or waivers from our lenders 
we have been in discussions with our lenders and believe that we would be able to obtain any required amendments or waivers  but can give no assurance that we would be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required amendments or waivers  our lenders would have the right to exercise remedies specified in the loan agreements  including accelerating the repayment of our debt obligations and taking collection actions against us 
if such acceleration occurred  we currently have insufficient cash to pay the amounts owed and would be forced to obtain alternative financing as discussed above 
please see item business risk factors the terms of our three year subordinated secured term loan contain certain financial covenants with respect to our performance and other covenants that restrict our activities 
if we are unable to comply with these covenants  the lender could accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness and subject us to a cross default under our credit facility herein 
our independent registered public accounting firm s report issued in this annual report on form k included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  including our recent losses and our potential inability to comply with financial covenants 
see note to our financial statements 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets carrying amounts or the amount of and classification of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern

table of contents we operate on a week fiscal year 
fiscal years and were week periods while fiscal year was a week period 
we believe that the fifty third week of fiscal year does not materially effect the comparisons of fiscal year to fiscal years and in our discussion and analysis of results of operations 
for comparison purposes  we classify our stores as comparable or non comparable 
a new store s sales are not included in comparable store sales until the thirteenth month of operation 
sales from remodeled stores are excluded from comparable store sales during the period of remodeling 
we include our internet and catalog sales as one store in calculating our comparable store sales 
comparable store sales for fiscal year compare the fifty two week period ended february  to the fifty two week period ended february  comparable store sales for fiscal year compare the fifty three week period ended february  to the fifty three week period ended february  critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
for more information  please see note in the notes to the financial statements 
we believe that our application of accounting policies  and the estimates that are inherently required by these policies  are reasonable 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out retail inventory method 
consideration received from vendors relating to inventory purchases is recorded as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold  occupancy  and buying expenses after an agreement with the vendor is executed and when the related inventory is sold 
we physically count all merchandise inventory on hand twice annually  generally during the months of january and july  and adjust the recorded balance to reflect the results of the physical counts 
we record estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts based on historical results 
inventory shrinkage is included as a component of cost of merchandise sold  occupancy  and buying costs 
permanent markdowns are recorded to reflect expected adjustments to retail prices in accordance with the retail inventory method 
in determining permanent markdowns  we consider current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product is held in inventory  and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory  among other factors 
the process of determining our expected adjustments to retail prices requires significant judgment by management 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of inventories could differ materially from our estimates 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory markdowns may be required 
store closing and impairment charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we regularly analyze the operating results of our stores and assess the viability of under performing stores to determine whether they should be closed or whether their associated assets  including furniture  fixtures  equipment  and leasehold improvements  have been impaired 
asset impairment tests are performed at least annually  on a store by store basis 
after allowing for an appropriate start up period  unusual nonrecurring events  and favorable trends  fixed assets of stores indicated to be impaired are written down to fair value 
during the years ended january   february  and february   we recorded   and  respectively  in noncash charges to earnings related to the impairment of long lived assets 
impairment expense in fiscal year related to certain underperforming stores and three prototype stores that we operated and have now determined to no longer be consistent with our strategic focus 
the prototype locations will be converted into wild pair stores in 
table of contents stock based compensation expense on january   the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which requires us to recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value 
stock based compensation expense is then recognized ratably over the service period related to each grant 
we used the modified prospective transition method under which financial statements covering periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
we determine the fair value of stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions regarding future dividends  expected volatility of our stock  and the expected lives of the options 
under sfas r we also make assumptions regarding the number of options and the number of shares of restricted stock and performance shares that will ultimately vest 
the assumptions and calculations required by sfas r are complex and require a high degree of judgment 
assumptions regarding the vesting of grants are accounting estimates that must be updated as necessary with any resulting change recognized as an increase or decrease in compensation expense at the time the estimate is changed 
sfas r also requires that excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows and operating cash outflows 
prior to january   we followed apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock options and the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period based on the amount by which the fair value of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of stock options at the date of grant 
the adoption of sfas r resulted in no significant change in the determination of stock based compensation expense compared to our previously disclosed pro forma stock based compensation expense determined using sfas during fiscal year and fiscal year  we made grants of performance shares under our incentive compensation plan 
based upon the degree of achievement of performance objectives for net sales and return on average assets through performance periods through fiscal year  we will issue a total of between zero and  shares of common stock under these performance share grants 
during fiscal year  we granted  shares of restricted stock under our incentive compensation plan 
during fiscal year  and  we granted   and  stock options  respectively  under our stock option plan 
as of february   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation is  and the weighted average period over which this compensation is expected to be recognized is years 
deferred income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred taxes are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
in accordance with fasb sfas  we regularly assesses available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset balances will be recovered from a reversals of deferred tax liabilities  b potential utilization of net operating loss carrybacks  c tax planning strategies and d future taxable income 
sfas places significant restrictions on the consideration of future taxable income in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets in situations where a company has experienced a cumulative loss in recent years 
when sufficient negative evidence exists that indicates that full realization of deferred tax assets is no longer more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established as necessary against the deferred tax assets  increasing our income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached 
subsequently  the valuation allowance is adjusted up or down as necessary to maintain coverage against the deferred tax assets 
if  in the future  sufficient positive evidence  such as a sustained return to profitability  arises that would indicate that realization of 
table of contents deferred tax assets is once again more likely than not  any existing valuation allowance would be reversed as appropriate  decreasing our income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached 
at february   we had adequate available net operating loss carryback potential to support the recorded balance of net deferred tax assets 
our loss before income taxes in fiscal year exceeded our loss carryback potential and resulted in a cumulative loss before income taxes for the three year period ending february  based on this factor and after evaluating other available evidence  we concluded that the realizability of net deferred tax assets was no longer more likely than not  and established a million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have scheduled the reversals of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and have concluded that based on the anticipated reversals  a valuation allowance is necessary only for the excess of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities 
we anticipate that until we re establish a pattern of continuing profitability  in accordance with sfas  we will not recognize any material income tax expense or benefit in our statement of operations for future periods  as pretax profits or losses will generate tax effects that will be offset by decreases or increases in the valuation allowance with no net effect on the statement of operations 
if a pattern of continuing profitability is re established and we conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets are realizable  we will reverse any remaining valuation allowance which will result in the recognition of an income tax benefit in the period that it occurs 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions  as defined 
fin requires  among other matters  that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we are subject to the provisions of fin as of february   the beginning of fiscal year  and we have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
our federal income tax returns subsequent to the fiscal year ended january  remain open 
as of february   we have not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits 
our policy  if we had unrecognized benefits  is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and other expense  respectively 
the adoption of fin had no effect on our financial statements for fiscal year fiscal year our fiscal year is based upon a week retail calendar  ending on the saturday nearest january the fiscal years ended february  fiscal year and january  fiscal year are week periods 
the fiscal year ended february  fiscal year was a week period 
we believe that the fifty third week of fiscal year does not materially affect comparisons with fiscal year and fiscal year

in september  we aggressively reviewed our existing inventory and took pricing actions that we believe were required to provide the freshness in product that our customers desire and facilitate the reduction of our inventory levels 
this significantly reduced gross margin achieved in fiscal year but resulted in a decrease in inventory the end of fiscal year compared to the end of fiscal year principal components of the change in gross margin in fiscal year are million of incremental gross profit from new stores  offset by a million decrease in gross profit from lower comparable store sales and a million decrease in gross profit from reduced margins

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an agreement to terminate a long term below market operating lease  in exchange for a million cash payment  and the right to continue occupying the space through january  we recognized a net gain of million from this transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which is reflected as a component of operating expenses 
our operating results are subject to significant seasonal variations 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of these seasonal variances  in particular our principal selling seasons 
we have five principal selling seasons transition post holiday  easter  back to school  fall and holiday 
sales and operating results in our third quarter are typically much weaker than in our other quarters 
quarterly comparisons may also be affected by the timing of sales promotions and costs associated with remodeling stores  opening new stores or acquiring stores 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on our debt and capital lease obligations 
historically  these cash needs have been met by cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of securities 
as discussed below in financing activities the balance on our revolving credit facility fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal working capital requirements and our other uses of cash 
our losses in fiscal year have had a negative impact on our financial position 
at february   we had negative working capital of million  unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million  and our shareholders equity had declined to million 
as a result of low levels of unused borrowing capacity  we took actions to obtain additional sources of liquidity  including raising million in net proceeds from a private placement of million of subordinated convertible debentures in june and amending our revolving credit facility to temporarily increase our unused borrowing capacity by million through september  on december   we entered into an agreement to terminate a long term below market operating lease in exchange for a million cash payment received on december  and the right to 
table of contents continue occupying the space through january  we used the net proceeds of approximately million to reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility 
we do not believe that we have any other operating leases that could be terminated on substantially similar terms 
subsequent to year end  we obtained million in net proceeds from a million subordinated term loan and issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of april   the balance on our revolving line of credit was million and unused borrowing capacity was million 
in september  we announced that we were taking certain actions that we expect will result in annual reductions in planned expenses of approximately million which would improve our liquidity and operating results in fiscal year with benefits also positively affecting net income in the fourth quarter of these actions include refocusing our merchandising and inventory strategy to lower inventory levels and improve inventory turnover metrics 
as of the end of fiscal year  we had reduced inventory levels below inventory at the end of fiscal year we also delayed most store expansion and remodeling projects until funding for such expansion can be generated from ongoing operating activities 
we continue to face considerable liquidity constraints  which were exacerbated by continued soft sales during february and march in which our comparable store sales were down 
as of may   our fiscal april comparable store sales are flat and as discussed above in overview  have returned to levels consistent with our business plan  under which we maintain adequate levels of liquidity for the remainder of fiscal year although we believe our business plan is achievable  should we fail to achieve the sales or gross margin levels we anticipate  or if we were to incur significant unplanned cash outlays  it would become necessary for us to obtain additional sources of liquidity or make further cost cuts to fund our operations 
however  there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  or to successfully further reduce costs in such a way that would continue to allow us to operate our business

based on our business plan for the remainder of the year and our other actions  we believe that we will be able to comply with our financial covenants 
however  given the inherent volatility in our sales performance  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in addition  in light of our recent sales results and the current state of the economy  we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we may not be able to comply with our minimum ebitda covenant 
failure to comply would be a default under the terms of our term loan and could result in the acceleration of our term loan  and possibly all of our debt obligations

there was a million reduction in inventory  a net reduction in current and deferred income tax assets of million  and an increase of million in accrued rent liabilities 
our inventories at february  decreased to million from million at february  we believe that at february   inventory levels and valuations are appropriate given current and anticipated sales trends  however  there is always the possibility that fashion trends could change suddenly 
we monitor our inventory levels closely and will take appropriate actions  including taking additional markdowns  as necessary  to maintain the freshness of our inventory 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operations of million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
besides the million decrease in net income  the primary components of this decrease are an million reduction of accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued income taxes 
we are committed under noncancelable operating leases for all store and office spaces 
these leases expire at various dates through and generally provide for minimum rent plus payments for real estate taxes and operating expenses  subject to escalations 
some of our leases also require us to pay contingent rent based on sales 
as of february   our lease payment obligations under these leases totaled approximately million for fiscal year  and an aggregate of approximately million through our ability to meet our current and anticipated operating requirements will depend on our future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 

table of contents investing activities in fiscal year  cash provided by investing activities was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year during each year  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements for both new and remodeled stores  and new information systems 
a portion of the capital expenditures  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year  relate to construction in progress for new and remodeled stores to be opened during the spring of the following year 
on december   we entered into an agreement to terminate a long term below market operating lease in exchange for a million cash payment received on december  and the right to continue occupying the space through january  we used the net proceeds of approximately million to reduce the balance on our revolving line of credit 
we do not believe that we have any other operating leases that could be terminated on substantially similar terms 
we have limited our planned capital expenditures for fiscal year to opening two new stores and remodeling two stores 
our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
we continuously evaluate our future capital expenditure plans and adjust planned expenditures  as necessary  based on business conditions 
as of april   we have opened one new store in fiscal year capital expenditures for a new store typically range from  to over  we generally receive landlord allowances in connection with new stores ranging from  to  the average cash investment in inventory for a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as marketing  salaries  supplies  rent and utilities are expensed as incurred 
remodeling the average existing store into the new format typically costs approximately  we remodeled seven stores during fiscal year as of april   we have not remodeled any stores in fiscal year we currently project our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately million 
we anticipate being able to fund this level of store expansion from the receipt of landlord allowances  internally generated cash flow  and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
financing activities in fiscal year  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the principal source of cash from financing activities in fiscal year was the net proceeds of approximately million from the placement of subordinated convertible debentures

following the occurrence of any event of default  the interest rate may be increased by an additional two percentage points 
the revolving credit agreement also allows us to apply an interest rate based on libor london interbank offered rate  as defined in the agreement plus a margin rate of to per annum to a designated portion of the outstanding balance as set forth in the agreement 
the aggregate amount that we may borrow under the agreement at any time is further limited by a formula  which is based substantially on our inventory level but cannot be greater than the revolving credit ceiling 
the agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the administration of the agreement  we are required to pay a facility fee of  per month 
in addition  an unused line fee of per annum is payable monthly based on the difference between the revolving credit ceiling and the average loan balance under the agreement 
if contingencies related to early termination of the credit facility 
table of contents were to occur  or if we were to request and receive an accommodation from the lender in connection with the facility  we may be required to pay additional fees 
our credit facility includes financial and other covenants relating to  among other things  use of funds under the facility in accordance with our business plan  prohibiting a change of control  including any person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or our combined voting power as defined in the credit facility  maintaining a minimum availability  prohibiting new debt  restricting dividends and the repurchase of our stock and restricting certain acquisitions 
in the event that we were to violate any of these covenants  or if other indebtedness in excess of million could be accelerated  or in the event that or more of our leases could be terminated other than solely as the result of certain sales of common stock  the lender would have the right to accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the agreement  or to commence foreclosure proceedings on our assets 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of february  and expect to remain in compliance throughout fiscal year based on the expected execution of our business plan 
we had balances under our credit facility of million  and million as of february  and february   respectively 
we had approximately million and million in unused borrowing capacity calculated under the provisions of our credit facility as of february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal years and  the highest outstanding balances on our credit facility were million and million  respectively 
we primarily have used the borrowings on our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes and capital expenditures 
during fiscal year  we began to experience low levels of unused borrowing capacity based on our borrowing base calculations 
consequently  we requested and the bank agreed on april   to adjust the borrowing base calculation to provide for additional borrowing capacity of  for the period from april  through may  this agreement was subsequently extended through june   and  effective june   further extended until september  as of april   we had an outstanding balance of million and approximately million of unused borrowing capacity  based on our borrowing base calculations 
subordinated convertible debentures on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures the debentures to seven accredited investors in a private placement generating net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to repay amounts owed under our revolving credit facility 
the debentures are nonamortizing  bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually on each june and december  and mature on june  investors included corporate directors andrew n 
baur and scott c 
schnuck  an entity affiliated with mr 
baur  and advisory directors bernard a 
edison and julian edison 
the debentures are convertible into shares of common stock at any time 
the initial conversion price was per share 
the conversion price  and thus the number of shares into which the debentures are convertible  is subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
if we distribute any assets other than ordinary cash dividends  then generally each holder is entitled to receive a like amount of such distributed property 
in the event of a merger  consolidation  sale of substantially all of our assets  or reclassification or compulsory share exchange  then upon any subsequent conversion each holder will have the right to either the same property as it would have otherwise been entitled or cash in an amount equal to principal amount of the debenture  plus interest and any other amounts owed 
the debentures also contain a weighted average conversion price adjustment generally for future issuances  at prices less than the then current conversion price  of common stock or securities convertible into  or options to purchase  shares of common stock  excluding generally currently outstanding options  warrants or performance shares and any future issuances or deemed issuances pursuant to any properly authorized equity compensation plans 
in accordance with rules of the nasdaq  the debentures contain limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to the debentures regardless of how low the conversion price may be  including limitations generally requiring that the conversion price not be less than per share for debentures issued to advisory directors  corporate directors or the entity affiliated with mr 
baur  that we do not issue common stock amounting to more than of our common stock in the transaction or such that following conversion  the total number of shares 
table of contents beneficially owned by each holder does not exceed of our common stock 
these limitations may be removed with shareholder approval 
as a result of the issuance of common stock in february  subsequent to the end of fiscal year  in connection with our three year subordinated secured term loan  the conversion price of the debentures decreased from to  making the debentures convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the debentures generally provide for customary events of default  which could result in acceleration of all amounts owed  including default in required payments  failure to pay when due  or the acceleration of  other monetary obligations for indebtedness broadly defined in excess of million subject to certain exceptions  failure to observe or perform covenants or agreements contained in the transaction documents  including covenants relating to using the net proceeds  maintaining legal existence  prohibiting the sale of material assets outside of the ordinary course  prohibiting cash dividends and distributions  share repurchases  and certain payments to our officers and directors 
we generally have the right  but not the obligation  to redeem the unpaid principal balance of the debentures at any time prior to conversion if the closing price of our common stock as adjusted for stock dividends  subdivisions or combinations is equal to or above per share for each of consecutive trading days and certain other conditions are met 
we have also agreed to provide certain piggyback and demand registration rights  until two years after the debentures cease to be outstanding  to the holders under the securities act of relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures 
private placement of common stock and warrants in connection with our private placement of common stock and warrants  we sold warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  subject to anti dilution and other adjustments 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and  subject to certain conditions  expire on april  we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of through april  to the placement agent 
in certain circumstances  a cashless exercise provision becomes operative for the warrants issued to the investors 
in the event that the closing bid price of a share of our stock equals or exceeds per share for consecutive trading days  we have the ability to call the warrants  effectively forcing their exercise into common stock 
the warrants issued to the placement agent generally have the same terms and conditions  except that the cashless exercise provision is more generally available and the warrants are not subject to a call provision

as of february   the maximum amount of liquidated damages that we could be required to pay was  which represents two potential monthly payments of  we have not recorded a liability in connection with the registration rights agreement because  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we have concluded that it is not probable that we will make any payments under the liquidated damages provisions of the registration rights agreement 
our potential liability for liquidated damages with respect to this registration statement ended on april  we estimated the grant date fair value of the  stock purchase warrants  including the placement agent warrants  issued in connection with the private placement to be  using the black scholes formula assuming no dividends  a risk free interest rate of  expected volatility of  and expected warrant life of five years
