mpb s primary business consists of attracting deposits from its network of community banking offices operated by the bank 
the bank engages in full service commercial banking and trust business  making available to the community a wide range of financial services  including  but not limited to  installment loans  personal loans  mortgage and home equity loans  secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans  lines of credit  construction financing  farm loans  community development and local government loans and various types of time and demand deposits 
deposits of the bank are insured by the bank insurance fund of the fdic to the 
table of contents maximum extent provided by law 
in addition  the bank provides a full range of trust services through its trust department 
the bank also offers other services such as internet banking  telephone banking  cash management services  automated teller services and safe deposit boxes 
business strategy the bank provides an array of sophisticated products typically found only in major regional banks 
these services are provided to small to middle market businesses  high net worth individuals  and retail consumers through full service banking facilities 
several banking locations have seasoned management with significant lending experience who are responsible for credit and pricing decisions  subject to loan committee approval for larger credits 
this decentralized relationship management approach  coupled with the continuity of service by its banking officers  enables the bank to develop long term customer relationships  maintain high quality service and provide quick responses to customer needs 
mpb believes that its emphasis on local relationship banking  together with its conservative approach to lending and resultant strong asset quality  are important factors in the success and the growth of mpb 
the bank seeks credit opportunities of good quality within its target market that exhibit positive historical trends  stable cash flows and secondary sources of repayment from tangible collateral 
the bank extends credit for the purpose of obtaining and continuing long term relationships 
lenders are provided with detailed underwriting policies for all types of credit risks accepted by the bank and must obtain appropriate approvals for credit extensions in excess of conservatively assigned individual lending limits 
the bank also maintains strict documentation requirements and extensive credit quality assurance practices in order to identify credit portfolio weaknesses as early as possible so any exposures that are discovered might be reduced 
at december   the bank had full time and part time employees 
a collective bargaining agent represents none of the employees  and the bank believes it enjoys good relations with its personnel 
lending activities the bank offers a variety of loan products to its customers  including loans secured by real estate  commercial and consumer loans 
the bank s lending objectives are as follows to establish a diversified commercial loan portfolio  and to provide a satisfactory return to mpb s shareholders by properly pricing loans to include the cost of funds  administrative costs  bad debts  local economic conditions  competition  customer relationships  the term of the loan  credit risk  collateral quality and a reasonable profit margin 
credit risk is managed through portfolio diversification  underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices 
the bank generally secures its loans with real estate with such collateral values dependent and subject to change based on real estate market conditions within its market area 
as of december   the bank s highest concentrations of credit were in hotel motel and multiple family housing financings and most of the bank s business activity with customers was located in central pennsylvania  specifically in dauphin  lower northumberland  western schuylkill  and cumberland counties 

table of contents investment activities mpb s investment portfolio is used to improve earnings through investments of funds in higher yielding assets  while maintaining asset quality  which provide the necessary balance sheet liquidity for mpb 
mpb does not have any significant concentrations within investment securities 
mpb s entire portfolio of investment securities is considered available for sale 
as such  the investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value 
mpb s investments include us treasury  agency and municipal securities that are given a market price relative to investments of the same type with similar maturity dates 
as the interest rate environment of these securities changes  mpb s existing securities are valued differently in comparison 
this difference in value  or unrealized gain  amounted to  net of tax  as of december  a majority of the investments are high quality united states and municipal securities that if held to maturity are expected to yield no loss to the bank 
for additional information with respect to mpb s business activities  see part ii  item of this report 
sources of funds the bank primarily uses deposits and borrowings to finance lending and investment activities 
borrowing sources include advances from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  reverse repurchase agreements with investment banks and overnight borrowings from the bank s customers and correspondent bank 
all borrowings  except for the line of credit with the bank s correspondent bank  require collateral in the form of loans or securities 
borrowings are  therefore  limited by collateral levels and the available lines of credit extended by the bank s creditors 
as a result  deposits remain key to the future funding and growth of the business 
deposit growth within the banking industry has been generally slow due to strong competition from a variety of financial services companies 
this competition may require financial institutions to adjust their product offerings and pricing to adequately grow deposits 
competition the banking business is highly competitive  and the profitability of mpb depends principally upon the bank s ability to compete in its market area 
the bank actively competes with other financial services companies for deposit and loan business 
competitors include other commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  insurance companies  securities brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  and money market funds 
financial institutions compete primarily on the quality of services rendered  interest rates on loans and deposits  service charges  the convenience of banking facilities  location and hours of operation and  in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers  relative lending limits 
many competitors are significantly larger than the bank and have significantly greater financial resources  personnel and locations from which to conduct business 
in addition  the bank is subject to banking regulations while certain competitors may not be 
there are relatively few barriers for companies wanting to enter into the financial services industry 
for more information  see the supervision and regulation section below 
mpb has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing technology and customer service  including local branch decision making on loans  establishing long term customer relationships and building customer loyalty  and providing 
table of contents products and services designed to address the specific needs of its customers 
the gramm leach bliley act see discussion below  which breaks down many barriers between the banking  securities and insurance industries  may significantly affect the competitive environment in which mpb operates 
the growth of mutual funds over the past decade has made it increasingly difficult for financial institutions to attract deposits 
the continued flow of cash into mutual funds  much of which is made through tax deferred investment vehicles such as k plans  and a generally strong economy  have  until recently  fueled high returns for these investments  in particular  certain equity funds 
these returns perpetuated the flow of additional investment dollars into mutual funds and other products not traditionally offered by banks 
in addition  insurance companies recently have become more significant competitors for deposits through their thrift subsidiaries 
further  mpb s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in central pennsylvania  especially in dauphin  lower northumberland  western schuylkill and eastern cumberland counties  which we define as our primary market 
the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation  recession  unemployment  real estate values  trends in the national and global economics  and other factors beyond our control 
an economic recession or a delayed recovery over a prolonged period of time in the central pennsylvania area could cause an increase in the level of the bank s non performing assets and loan and lease losses  thereby causing operating losses  impairing liquidity and eroding capital 
we cannot assure you that further adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on mpb s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
supervision and regulation general bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws 
the regulation and supervision of mpb and the bank are designed primarily for the protection of depositors  the fdic  and the monetary system  and not mpb or its shareholders 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver  cease and desist orders and written agreements  the termination of insurance on deposits  the imposition of civil money penalties and removal and prohibition orders 
if any enforcement action is taken by a banking regulator  the value of an equity investment in mpb could be substantially reduced or eliminated 
federal and state banking laws contain numerous provisions affecting various aspects of the business and operations of mpb and the bank 
mpb is subject to  among others  the regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to  among others  the regulations of the pennsylvania department of banking and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the following descriptions of and references to applicable statutes and regulations are not intended to be complete descriptions of these provisions or their effects on mpb or the bank 
they are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
holding company regulation mpb is a registered bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
as such  it is subject to the bank holding company act of bhca and many of the federal reserve s regulations promulgated thereunder 
the federal reserve has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies  including the power to impose substantial fines and civil penalties 

table of contents the bhca requires mpb to file an annual report with the federal reserve regarding the holding company and its subsidiary bank 
the federal reserve board also makes examinations of the holding company 
the bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  however  the federal reserve possesses cease and desist powers over bank holding companies and their subsidiaries where their actions would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or violation of law 
the bhca restricts a bank holding company s ability to acquire control of additional banks 
in addition  the bhca restricts the activities in which bank holding companies may engage directly or through non bank subsidiaries 
gramm leach bliley financial modernization act the gramm leach bliley act glb became effective on march  the primary purpose of glb was to eliminate barriers between investment banking and commercial banking and to permit  within certain limitations  the affiliation of financial service providers 
generally  glb repealed the historical restrictions against  and eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks  securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers  provided a uniform framework for the activities of banks  savings institutions and their holding companies  broadened the activities that may be conducted by and through national banks and other banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  provided an enhanced framework for protecting the privacy of consumers information  adopted a number of provisions related to the capitalization  membership  corporate governance and other measures designed to modernize the federal home loan bank system  modified the laws governing the implementation of the community reinvestment act  and addressed a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of financial institutions 
more specifically  under glb  bank holding companies  such as mpb  that meet certain management  capital  and community reinvestment act standards  are permitted to become financial holding companies and  by doing so  to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and to engage in other activities that are financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary to such activities 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdic improvement acts prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
the required filing is a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company and meets all applicable requirements 

table of contents no prior regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities permitted under glb 
activities cited by glb as being financial in nature include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the federal reserve has determined to be closely related to banking 
in addition to permitting financial services providers to enter into new lines of business  the law allows firms the freedom to streamline existing operations and to potentially reduce costs 
the act may increase both opportunity as well as competition 
many community banks are less able to devote the capital and management resources needed to facilitate broad expansion of financial services including insurance and brokerage services 
corporate governance on july   the sarbanes oxley act of was enacted 
the sarbanes oxley act represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance  auditor independence and accounting standards  executive compensation  insider loans  whistleblower protection  and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information 
the sarbanes oxley act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered or that file reports under the securities exchange act of in particular  the sarbanes oxley act established new requirements for audit committees  including independence  expertise and responsibilities  additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company  new standards for auditors and regulation of audits  increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers  and new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws 
the sec and amex have adopted numerous rules implementing the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act that affect mpb 
the changes are intended to allow shareholders to monitor more effectively the performance of companies and management 
increased costs have been approximately  annually related to mpb s compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
bank regulation the bank  a pennsylvania chartered institution  is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the pennsylvania department of banking and the fdic 
the deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic to the extent provided by law 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums the amount of which may  in the future  depend in part on the condition of the bank 
moreover  the fdic may terminate deposit insurance of the bank under certain circumstances 
the bank regulatory agencies have broad enforcement powers over depository institutions under their jurisdiction  including the power to terminate deposit insurance  to impose fines and other 
table of contents civil and criminal penalties  and to appoint a conservator or receiver if any of a number of conditions is met 
in addition  the bank is subject to a variety of local  state and federal laws that affect its operations 
banking regulations include  but are not limited to  permissible types and amounts of loans  investments and other activities  capital adequacy  branching  interest rates on loans and the safety and soundness of banking practices 
capital requirements under risk based capital requirements for bank holding companies  mpb is required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit of eight percent 
at least half of the total capital is to be composed of common equity  retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier capital and together with tier capital  total capital 
the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  non qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance tier capital 
in addition  the federal reserve board has established minimum leverage ratio requirements for bank holding companies 
these requirements provide for a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets leverage ratio equal to for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies will generally be required to maintain a leverage ratio of from at least 
the requirements also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the requirements indicate that the federal reserve board will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio deducting all intangibles in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity 
the federal reserve board has not advised mpb of any specific minimum tier leverage ratio applicable to it 
the bank is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the fdic 
the fdic has not advised the bank of any specific minimum leverage ratios applicable to it 
the capital ratios of mpb and the bank are described in note to mpb s consolidated financial statements 
banking regulators continue to indicate their desire to further develop capital requirements applicable to banking organizations 
changes to capital requirements could materially affect the profitability of mpb or the market value of mpb stock 
fdic improvement act as a result of the fdic improvement act of  banks are subject to increased reporting requirements and more frequent examinations by the bank regulatory agencies 
the agencies also have the authority to dictate certain key decisions that formerly were left to management  including compensation standards  loan underwriting standards  asset growth  and payment of dividends 
failure to comply with these standards  or failure to maintain capital above specified levels set by the regulators  could lead to the imposition of penalties or the forced resignation of management 
if a bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the banking agencies have the authority to place an institution into receivership 

table of contents safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia  the federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards for depository institutions such as the bank 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal shareholder 
in addition  the agencies adopted regulations that authorize an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails to implement an accepted plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions be taken  including restricting asset growth  restricting interest rates paid on deposits  and requiring an increase in the institution s ratio of tangible equity to assets 
payment of dividends and other restrictions mpb is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary  the bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the bank can  among other things  finance  or otherwise supply funds to  mpb 
specifically  dividends from the bank are the principal source of mpb s cash funds and there are certain legal restrictions under pennsylvania law and pennsylvania banking regulations on the payment of dividends by state chartered banks 
the relevant regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit mpb and the bank from engaging in what  in the opinion of such regulatory body  constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the payment of dividends could  depending upon the financial condition of mpb and the bank  be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice 
prompt corrective action in addition to the required minimum capital levels described above  federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective actions which federal banking agencies are required to take  and certain actions which they have discretion to take  based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls 
regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution  which is not adequately capitalized 
under the rules  an institution will be deemed to be adequately capitalized or better if it exceeds the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements 
however  it will be deemed undercapitalized if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than the prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan  along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party 
in addition  an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions including a prohibition on payment of dividends  a limitation on asset growth and expansion  in 
table of contents certain cases  a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers  and a prohibition on the payment of certain management fees to any controlling person 
institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions  including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring  a limitation on the institution s ability to make acquisitions  open new branch offices  or engage in new lines of business  obligations to raise additional capital  restrictions on transactions with affiliates  and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits 
in certain cases  bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors  or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser 
if an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized and continues in that category for four quarters  the statute requires  with certain narrowly limited exceptions  that the institution be placed in receivership 
deposit insurance deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic through the bank insurance fund bif 
the insurance assessments paid by an institution are to be based on the probability that the fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution 
the fdic has adopted deposit insurance regulations under which insured institutions are assigned to one of the following three capital groups based on their capital levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized 
banks in each of these three groups are further classified into three subgroups based upon the level of supervisory concern with respect to each bank 
the resulting matrix creates nine assessment risk classifications to which are assigned deposit insurance premiums ranging from for the best capitalized  healthiest institutions  to for undercapitalized institutions with substantial supervisory concerns 
the fdic sets deposit insurance assessment rates on a semiannual basis and will increase deposit insurance assessments whenever the ratio of reserves to insured deposits in a fund is less than 
while under the current assessment matrix  the bank does not pay any assessments for deposit insurance  because of past bank failures there is a possibility that the fdic will adjust the assessment matrix in the future and that as a result the bank may have to start paying insurance assessments 
the bank is also subject to quarterly assessments relating to interest payments on financing corporation fico bonds issued in connection with the resolution of the thrift industry crisis 
the fico assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the bif and saif 
the fico assessments on bif insured deposits are set at an annual rate of 
of assessable deposits 
environmental laws management does not anticipate that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have any material effect on mpb s capital  expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
however  environmentally related hazards have become a source of high risk and potentially unlimited liability for financial institutions 
in  the pennsylvania general assembly enacted the economic development agency  fiduciary and lender environmental liability protection act  which among other things  provides protection to lenders from environmental liability and remediation costs under the environmental laws for releases and contamination caused by others 
a lender who engages in activities involved in the routine practices of commercial lending  including  but not limited to  the providing of financial services  holding of security interests  workout practices  foreclosure or 
table of contents the recovery of funds from the sale of property shall not be liable under the environmental acts or common law equivalents to the pennsylvania department of environmental resources or to any other person by virtue of the fact that the lender engages in such commercial lending practice 
a lender  however  will be liable if it  its employees or agents  directly cause an immediate release or directly exacerbate a release of regulated substance on or from the property  or known and willfully compelled the borrower to commit an action which caused such release or violate an environmental act 
the economic development agency  fiduciary and lender environmental liability protection act does not limit federal liability which still exists under certain circumstances 
consumer protection laws there are a number of laws that govern the relationship between the bank and its customers 
for example  the community reinvestment act is designed to encourage lending by banks to persons in low and moderate income areas 
the home mortgage disclosure act and the equal credit opportunity act attempt to minimize lending decisions based on impermissible criteria  such as race or gender 
the truth in lending act and the truth in savings act require banks to provide certain disclosure of relevant terms related to loans and savings accounts  respectively 
anti tying restrictions which prohibit  for instance  conditioning the availability or terms of credit on the purchase of another banking product further restrict the bank s relationships with its customers 
privacy laws in  the federal banking regulators issued final regulations implementing certain provisions of glb governing the privacy of consumer financial information 
the regulations limit the disclosure by financial institutions  such as mpb and the bank  of nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain financial products or services for personal  family  or household purposes 
subject to certain exceptions allowed by law  the regulations cover information sharing between financial institutions and nonaffiliated third parties 
more specifically  the regulations require financial institutions to provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  provide annual notices of their privacy policies to their current customers  and provide a reasonable method for consumers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
protection of customer information in  the federal banking regulators issued final regulations implementing the provisions of glb relating to the protection of customer information 
the regulations  applicable to the mpb and the bank  relate to administrative  technical  and physical safeguards for customer records and information 
these safeguards are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records  and 
table of contents protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
affiliate transactions transactions between mpb and the bank and its affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of a bank or savings institution is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by  or is under common control with the bank or savings institution 
generally  a subsidiary of a depository institution that is not also a depository institution is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of sections a and b 
sections a and b are intended to protect insured depository institutions from suffering losses arising from transactions with non insured affiliates  by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate  and requiring that such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
in  the federal reserve adopted a new regulation  regulation w  effective april   that comprehensively amends sections a and b 
the regulation unifies and updates staff interpretations issued over the years  incorporates several new interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate  and addresses new issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of non banking activities engaged in by bank and bank holding companies in recent years and authorized for financial holding companies under the glb 
the usa patriot act in  the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of usa patriot act was signed into law 
the usa patriot act broadened the application of anti money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions  such as broker dealers  and strengthened the ability of the us government to detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions  including state chartered banks establish an anti money laundering program that includes training and audit components  comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account  take additional required precautions with non us owned accounts  and perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships 
the usa patriot act also expanded the conditions under which funds in a us interbank account may be subject to forfeiture and increased the penalties for violation of anti money laundering regulations 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot acts requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
the bank has adopted policies  procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the usa patriot act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies  procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations 

table of contents anti money laundering and anti terrorism financing under title iii of the usa patriot act  also known as the international money laundering abatement and anti terrorism financing act of  all financial institutions  including mpb and the bank  are required in general to identify their customers  adopt formal and comprehensive anti money laundering programs  scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern  and be prepared to respond to inquiries from us law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions 
additional information sharing among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement authorities is encouraged by the presence of an exemption from the privacy provisions of the glb act for financial institutions that comply with this provision and the authorization of the secretary of the treasury to adopt rules to further encourage cooperation and information sharing 
the effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the bank merger act  which applies to the bank 
effects of government policy and potential changes in regulation changes in regulations applicable to mpb or the bank  or shifts in monetary or other government policies  could have a material affect on our business 
mpb s and the bank s business is also affected by the state of the financial services industry in general 
as a result of legal and industry changes  management believes that the industry will continue to experience an increased rate of change as the financial services industry strives for greater product offerings  market share and economies of scale 
from time to time  legislation is enacted that has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  and before various bank regulatory agencies 
mpb cannot predict the likelihood of any major changes or the impact such changes might have on mpb and or the bank 
various congressional bills and other proposals have proposed a sweeping overhaul of the banking system  including provisions for limitations on deposit insurance coverage  changing the timing and method financial institutions use to pay for deposit insurance  expanding the power of banks by removing the restrictions on bank underwriting activities  and tightening the regulation of bank derivatives activities  and allowing commercial enterprises to own banks 
mpb s earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had  and will likely continue to have  an impact on the operating results of commercial banks because of the federal reserve s power to implement national monetary policy  to  among other things  curb inflation or combat recession 
the federal reserve has a major impact on the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
from time to time  various types of federal and state legislation have been proposed that could result in additional regulation of  and restrictions on  the business of the bank 
it cannot be predicted whether any such legislation will be adopted or  if adopted  how such legislation would 
table of contents affect the business of the bank 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the united states  the bank s business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal legislation and regulations that may increase the costs of doing business

risk factors 
mpb is subject to interest rate risk mpb s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond mpb s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest mpb receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i mpb s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of mpb s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of mpb s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  mpb s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on mpb s results of operations 
any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on mpb s financial condition and results of operations 
mpb is subject to lending risk as of december   approximately of mpb s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans 
these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
because mpb s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on mpb s financial condition and results of operations 
mpb s allowance for possible loan and lease losses may be insufficient mpb maintains an allowance for possible loan and lease losses  which is a reserve established through provisions for possible losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires mpb to make significant estimates of current credit risks and 
table of contents future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem credits and other factors  both within and outside of mpb s control  may require an increase in the allowance 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review mpb s and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance  mpb will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on mpb s financial condition and results of operations 
competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect mpb s profitability mpb s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating  both commercial and consumer loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of its competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce the corporation s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates they may charge on these loans 
in attracting business and consumer deposits  its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of mpb s competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more convenient branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than mpb  which could decrease the deposits that it attracts or require it to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect mpb s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations 
as a result  it may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds 
mpb s banking subsidiary also competes with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  credit unions  insurance agencies and governmental organizations  which may offer more favorable terms 
some of its non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its banking operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over mpb s banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit its margins on banking services  reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition 
mpb s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates mpb s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of mpb s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on mpb s business  results of operations and financial condition

there is no assurance that its subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that mpb will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future 
mpb s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock 
mpb may not be able to attract and retain skilled people mpb s success depends  in large part  on its ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by mpb can be intense and mpb may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of mpb s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on mpb s business because of their skills  knowledge of mpb s market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel

any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on mpb s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on mpb s financial condition and results of operations 
the trading volume in mpb s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies mpb s common stock is listed for trading on amex  the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of mpb s common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which mpb has no control 
given the lower trading volume of mpb s common stock  significant sales of mpb s common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause mpb s stock price to fall
