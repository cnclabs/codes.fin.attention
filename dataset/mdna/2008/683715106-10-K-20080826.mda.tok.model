acquisitions our competitive position in the marketplace requires us to maintain a complex and evolving array of technologies  products  services and capabilities 
in light of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate  we regularly evaluate various acquisition opportunities within the ecm marketplace and elsewhere in the high technology industry 
we believe our acquisitions support our long term strategic direction  strengthen our competitive position  expand our customer base and provide greater scale to accelerate innovation  grow our earnings and increase shareholder value 
we expect to continue to strategically acquire companies  products  services and technologies to augment our existing business 
in fiscal  we purchased certain miscellaneous assets from a canadian company in the amount of million 
in fiscal  we made the following two acquisitions in october  we completed the acquisition of hummingbird ltd 
hummingbird  a toronto based  global provider of ecm solutions in an all cash deal for million net of cash acquired 
in march  we acquired momentum systems inc momentum  an arlington  virginia based company  with a history of serving the government sector  for million in cash net of cash acquired 
acquisitions subsequent to june  on july   we announced the acquisition of a division of spicer corporation  a privately held company based in kitchener  ontario  canada 
total cash consideration paid for this acquisition was approximately million 
the division acquired specializes in file format viewer solutions for desktop applications  integrated business process management systems and reprographics

key partnership alliances of open text include oracle  microsoft  sap  deloitte  accenture and hitachi 
we rely on close cooperation with partners for sales and product development  as well as for the optimization of 
table of contents opportunities which arise in our competitive environment 
we continue to make significant progress with our global partner program  with emphasis on developing strategic relations and achieving close integration with partners 
business generated through areas like archiving  records management and compliance continue to be driven through our partners 
our revenue from partners contributed approximately of our license revenues in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal outlook for fiscal we believe that we have a strong position in the ecm market and that the market for content solutions remains robust 
we have a diversified footprint  in that more than of our revenues are from outside of north america  which helps to insulate us from the slowdown currently being experienced in the us economy 
also  slightly over of our revenues are from maintenance revenues  which are a recurring source of income and as such  we expect this trend to continue  as historically our renewal rate for maintenance services is in excess of 
additionally  our focus on compliance based products also helps insulate us from downturns in the macro economic environment 
for fiscal  the industry expectation is that the overall ecm market will grow in the range of to  and we expect our license growth to be in line with the growth of the overall ecm market 
we expect our revenue mix to be in the following ranges of total revenue license to customer support to services to our focus for fiscal will be to continue growing license revenue  and continue to focus on partner influenced sales

table of contents quarterly revenues and expenses are impacted by a number of external factors including the timing of large transactions  timing of budget approvals of our customers  acquisitions  seasonality of economic activity and to some degree the timing of capital spend by our customers 
fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations the following table presents an overview of our results of operations in thousands change from fiscal total revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net  interest income expense net  income taxes and minority interest net income gross margin n a gross margin before amortization of acquired technology intangible assets n a immediately upon the acquisition of hummingbird  we restructured both hummingbird and pre acquisition open text operations into one combined organization 
sales forces were aligned and all back office functions such as accounting and information technology were consolidated to manage the combined operations 
our research and development teams quickly prepared integration code to combine products and features between previous hummingbird and open text products 
most former hummingbird executive management and many next levels of management personnel were terminated  and primarily open text management assumed all responsibilities for sales  service  research and development  and general and administrative activities 
in view of the shared resources  single line management and combined operations  presentation of the results of operations of open text and hummingbird separately is  we believe  not meaningful and therefore not articulated within this discussion and analysis 
revenues revenue by product type and geography the following tables set forth our revenues by product  revenue as a percentage of the related product revenue and revenue by major geography for each of the periods indicated revenue by product type in thousands change increase decrease license customer support services total 
table of contents of total revenue license customer support services total revenue by geography in thousands change increase decrease north america europe other total of total revenue north america europe other total license revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of software products to customers 
license revenue increased by approximately million primarily as the result of increased revenues from our european operations and the impact of increased partner influenced sales 
of the total growth achieved  europe accounted for of the increase  while north america contributed to of the increase and the other geographic area contributed to the rest 
license revenue was favorably impacted as a result of growth in partner influenced license revenue 
for fiscal  approximately of our license revenue came from partner influenced transactions versus approximately in fiscal overall  our average license transaction size for sales in excess of  went up in fiscal compared to fiscal as set out in the table below 
fiscal year fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in addition  in fiscal we had individual license transactions of million or greater  compared to such transactions in fiscal customer support revenue consists of revenue from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from such support and maintenance agreements relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
as our installed base grows  the renewal rate has a larger influence on customer support revenue than the current software revenue growth 
therefore changes in customer support revenue do not necessarily correlate directly to the changes in license revenue in a given period 
typically the term of these support and maintenance agreements is twelve months  with customer 
table of contents renewal options 
we have historically experienced a renewal rate over but continue to encounter pricing pressure from our customers during contract negotiation and renewal 
new license sales create additional customer support agreements which contribute substantially to the increase in our customer support revenue 
customer support revenues increased by approximately million primarily as the result of growth from our north america operations 
of the total growth achieved  north america accounted for of the increase  while europe contributed of the increase and the other geographic area contributed the rest 
service revenue consists of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide training and integration services 
service revenue increased by approximately million primarily as the result of growth from our european operations

cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs 
cost of customer support revenues increased by million primarily due to an increase in direct costs associated with increased customer service revenues for fiscal overall gross margin on customer support revenue has remained stable at approximately 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training with respect to our various software products 
the most significant component of these costs is personnel related expenses 
the other components include travel costs and third party subcontracting 
cost of service revenues increased by million primarily due to increased costs associated with increased service revenues for fiscal overall gross margin on service revenue has improved over fiscal  as a result of improved execution of billable utilization and longer term assignments 

table of contents amortization of acquired technology intangible assets increased by million primarily due to the full year impact of the amortization of acquired technology assets acquired as part of the hummingbird acquisition 
these acquired technology assets  in the amount of million  are being amortized over a period of years 
operating expenses the following table sets forth total operating expenses by function and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change increase decrease research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer intangible assets special charges recoveries total in of total revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired customer intangible assets special charges recoveries research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facility costs 
research and development expenses increased by million due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million 
the remaining increase is the result of an in process research and development expense of million relating to our hummingbird acquisition  the full year impact of the hummingbird acquisition of million  consulting fees of million  travel expenses of million and the remainder due to an increase in office  overhead and miscellaneous expenses 
in fiscal we expect research and development expenses to be in the range of to of total revenue 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and costs associated with advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million 
the remaining increase is the result of an increase in travel expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and the remainder due to an increase in office  overhead and miscellaneous expenses 
in fiscal we expect sales and marketing costs to be in the range of to of total revenue 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative personnel  related overhead  facility expenses  audit fees  consulting expenses and separate public company costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by million due to an increase in direct labour and labour related benefits and expenses of million 
the remaining increase is the result of an increase in consulting expenses of million and office  overhead and miscellaneous expenses of million 
in fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to be in the range of to of total revenue 
depreciation expenses decreased slightly by million as the result of certain capital assets being fully depreciated during fiscal amortization of acquired intangible customer assets increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the full year impact of amortization of customer assets acquired as part of the hummingbird acquisition 
customer assets in the amount of million were acquired as part of the hummingbird acquisition  and these are being amortized over a period of years 
special charges recoveries typically relate to monies that we expect to pay on account of restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  impairment of long lived assets and other non recurring charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of streamlining existing open text operations that get impacted by significant acquisitions such as hummingbird 
actions related to such restructuring plans are  more often than not  completed within a period of one year 
in certain limited situations if the planned activity does not need to be implemented  or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out  we record a recovery of the originally recorded expense to special charges 
restructuring plans relating to legacy employee workforce reduction and abandonment of legacy excess facilities of the acquired company are not included within special charges  but are accounted for as part of the cost of the acquisition  unless such charges relate to additional accruals recorded after the purchase price allocation period 
see note for more details 
the reduction in special charges in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the fact that the major actions connected to our fiscal restructuring plan were already complete as of the end of our fiscal and we did not implement any new restructuring plans during fiscal for more details on special charges recoveries  see note net interest expense is primarily made up of cash interest paid on our debt facilities and the unrealized gain loss on our interest rate collar  offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our million long term debt obtained in october  the term loan  for the purpose of partially financing our hummingbird acquisition 
the term loan bears floating rate interest at libor plus a fixed rate which is currently set at per annum 
in addition  as required by the lenders of the term loan  we also entered into an interest rate collar the collar which enclosed the floating portion of our interest rate obligations associated with a portion of the term loan  within an upper limit of and a lower limit of 
we account for the collar as a derivative instrument that is marked to market  with the changes in fair value being charged to interest expense in the period to which such changes relate 
this change in value is the theoretical or unrealized gain loss on the interest rate collar and reflects the change in the fair value of the collar between reporting periods 
throughout fiscal  interest rates have been declining  while this has favorably impacted our cash interest payments  it has also significantly increased the negative fair value of our collar  as the valuation of the collar is influenced by current and expected future interest rates 
it is important to note  however  that as the collar approaches maturity in december the negative fair value that is being seen now will eventually unwind and the value of the collar will trend back up to nil or even a positive value if interest rates start moving upwards 
if interest rates continue to move downwards we will likely have to continue to make cash payments on the collar  equivalent to the difference between the lower range of the collar and libor applied to the hedged portion of the term loan 

table of contents to date  since entering into the agreement  we have made net payments of  on the collar 
we expect to make a payment of  on the collar in the first quarter of fiscal although we are not able to predict future changes in the fair value of the collar with certainty  or the amount that we expect to pay or receive in future quarters  we expect to see its fair value approach nil as the collar approaches its contractual maturity 
net interest expense increased by million primarily due to i an increase in the unrealized loss on the fair value of the collar of million  ii an increase in the amount paid on the collar of  iii an increase in tax related interest expense of  and iv an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs of  these increases were offset by higher interest income earned of million  as the result of a larger pool of investable cash in the current fiscal year and lower interest paid on the long term debt of million 
the remaining increase in interest expense is due to miscellaneous items 
for more details on interest expenses see note and also the discussion under long term debt and credit facilities under the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal our effective tax rate has remained relatively stable at in fiscal versus in fiscal the slight decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal versus the preceding fiscal year is in part due to higher taxable income in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the canadian statutory rate and in part due to the use of deferred tax assets which had a valuation allowance recorded against it in the prior year 
our deferred tax assets totaling million are based upon available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon us generating income in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the recognized deferred tax liability of million is primarily made up of three components 
the first component relates to million arising from acquired identifiable intangible assets 
the second component of million relates primarily to deferred credits arising from non capital losses and undeducted scientific research and development experimental expenditures acquired at a discount on asset acquisitions  which will be included in income as they are utilized 
the third component of million relates to deferred tax liability arising from investment tax credits 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect of our deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  
this valuation allowance is primarily attributable to valuation allowances set up based on losses incurred in the current and prior years 
in order to fully utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets of million  we will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 
based on our current projection of taxable income for the periods in the jurisdictions in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the recognized deferred income tax assets as of june  liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased by million in fiscal due to an increase in net income of million  an increase in non cash adjustments of million  and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in non cash adjustments was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  largely as the result of the full year impact of the hummingbird acquisition  and an increase in the 
table of contents unrealized loss on the fair value of our collar by million  as the result of decreasing interest rates in fiscal these increases were offset by an increase in deferred tax recoveries of million 
the remaining increase in non cash adjustments relates to miscellaneous items 
the increase in operating assets and liabilities of million is primarily due to higher deferred revenue balances in the amount of million and an increase in taxes payable of million 
the increase in deferred revenues is on account of higher cash collections from a larger customer base 
these increases were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a reduction of accounts payable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the overall increase in revenue 
the remaining movement in operating assets and liabilities is due to miscellaneous changes in prepaid expenses  other current assets and other assets 
cash flows used in investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily on account of business acquisitions 
in the aftermath of our more significant acquisitions  such as ixos and hummingbird  we typically implement exit plans for reduction of legacy workforces and legacy real estate facilities of the acquired company 
these plans are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules governing acquisition related accruals 
payments against these accruals are recorded as a use of cash in investing activities 
in addition  we are still in the process of acquiring the remaining minority interest of ixos 
in relation to this  we saw a lower level of purchases during fiscal versus fiscal as a result of the ixos squeeze out process continuing to be litigated against by the minority interest shareholders 
see note for a more detailed discussion of the squeeze out process 
in fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities were lower by million 
this reduction in spending was due to million having been spent on acquisitions during fiscal compared to million and million having been spent on the hummingbird and momentum acquisitions  respectively  in fiscal in addition we spent million less on additional purchase consideration relating to prior period acquisitions  inclusive of a reduction in purchase of the ixos minority interest in fiscal we also expended million less on acquisition related accruals due to the trailing off of these payments and the fact that we did not make significant acquisitions comparable to the hummingbird or ixos acquisitions in fiscal finally  we also saw a slight increase in capital asset purchases in the amount of approximately million during fiscal as discussed above  in accordance with the accounting rules for setting up acquisition related accruals  we set up accruals in the amount of million relating to an exit plan for workforce reductions of legacy hummingbird employees and abandonment of legacy hummingbird facilities 
during fiscal we made cash payments of approximately million relating to these accruals 
we expect to make the balance of the payments related to work force reductions by the end of fiscal cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities consist of long term debt financing and monies received from the issuance of shares exercised by our employees 
these inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non scheduled repayments of our long term debt financing and  when applicable  the repurchases of our shares 
during fiscal we significantly increased our long term debt borrowing see discussion under long term debt and credit facilities in the next section of this md a  in connection with our acquisition of hummingbird 
during fiscal  cash flow from financing activities was lower by million primarily due to the fact that we did not enter into any new or additional long term debt arrangements during the year 
long term debt and credit facilities on october   we acquired a million credit agreement the credit agreement with a canadian chartered bank the bank consisting of the term loan facility in the amount of million and a 
table of contents million committed revolving long term credit facility the revolver 
the term loan was used to partially finance the hummingbird acquisition and the revolver will be used for general business purposes  if necessary 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
see note for details relating to an additional  non significant  financing arrangement 
term loan the term loan has a seven year term and expires on october  and bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus 
the term loan principal repayments are equal to of the original principal amount  due each quarter with the remainder due at the end of the term  less ratable reductions for any prepayments made 
to date we have made total prepayments of million of the principal on the term loan  including prepayments of million in fiscal these payments have reduced the current quarterly principal payment to approximately as of june   the carrying value of the term loan was million and we are in compliance with all loan covenants relating to this facility 
as discussed earlier in the net interest expense section above  we have limited our exposure to the floating rate portion of the interest rate on the term loan  by entering into a three year interest rate collar that has the economic effect of circumscribing the floating portion of our interest rate obligations associated with million of the term loan within an upper limit of and a lower limit of 
as of june   in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the term loan agreement  the hedged portion of the loan was reduced to million 
revolver the revolver has a five year term and expires on october  borrowings under this revolver facility bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement 
the revolver is subject to a stand by fee ranging between and per annum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver as of june   and thus far  we have not borrowed any amounts under the revolver 
during fiscal  we obtained a demand guarantee in the amount of euro million 
see note for details 
building held for sale we currently own a building in toronto  canada acquired as part of the acquisition of hummingbird  which we have classified as an asset held for sale 
although we cannot determine the eventual selling price or the timing of the sale  we are actively marketing the property and expect to sell the building during fiscal as of june  the fair value of the building was estimated to be  and recorded  at million 
commitments and contractual obligations we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum annual payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows payments due by period ending june  total to to and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations net of million of non cancelable sublease income to be received from properties which we have subleased to other parties 

table of contents rental expense of million  million and million was recorded during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the long term debt obligations are comprised of interest and principal payments on our million term loan agreement and a five year mortgage on our headquarters in waterloo  ontario 
see note litigation we are subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles 
none of the operating leases described in the previous sentence has  or potentially may have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition including any possible changes in our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in accordance with us gaap  neither the lease liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet  as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for capitalization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles usgaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following business combinations we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets  intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the excess of purchase price  if any  being allocated to goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we test long lived assets or asset groups  such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets  for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 

table of contents recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds discounted projected future cash flows 
we recorded no impairment charge for long lived assets during the year ended june    during the year ended june  and million during the year ended june  see note for more details 
acquired intangibles acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions  as well as trademarks and patents 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
we amortize acquired technology over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer relationships represent relationships that we have with customers of the acquired companies and are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable  that is  capable of being separated from the acquired entity and being sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
these customer relationships are initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
we amortize customer relationships on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate the remaining estimated useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
goodwill fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
we performed  in accordance with sfas  our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of april  the analysis indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of our reporting units 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations  we adjust our credit limit to the respective customer 
in addition to these evaluations  we conduct on going credit evaluations of our customers payment history and current creditworthiness 
the allowance is maintained for of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and  for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible  an allowance is maintained for a specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts  our historical collection experience and current economic expectations 
to date  the actual losses have been within our expectations 
no single customer accounted for more than of the accounts receivable balance as of june  and revenue recognition a license revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october as amended by sop issued in december 
table of contents we record product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance by the customer  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our significant pcs renewal experience  from our existing worldwide base 
our multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
these rights are irrevocable to the customer s benefit  are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 
it is our experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we assess whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring 
our sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms 
these terms effectively relate to all customers  products  and arrangements regardless of customer type  product mix or arrangement size 
the only time exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs 
in these jurisdictions  our customary payment terms are in line with local practice 
b service revenues service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  we determine vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are rendered as the time is incurred by us 
we also enter into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements wherein the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element 
in such cases the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 

table of contents c customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide pcs to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advance billings of pcs are not recorded to the extent that the term of the pcs has not commenced and payment has not been received 
deferred revenue deferred revenue primarily relates to support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services 
generally  the services will be provided in the next twelve months 
long term sales contracts during fiscal we entered into certain long term sales contracts involving the sale of integrated solutions that include the modification and customization of software and the provision of services that are essential to the functionality of the other elements in this arrangement 
as prescribed by sop  we recognize revenue from such arrangements in accordance with the contract accounting guidelines in sop  accounting for performance of construction type contracts sop after evaluating for separation of any non sop elements in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when circumstances exist that allow us to make reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  contract costs and the progress of the contract to completion  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under the poc method  progress towards completion of the contract is measured based upon either input measures or output measures 
we measure progress towards completion based upon an input measure and calculate this as the proportion of the actual hours incurred compared to the total estimated hours 
for training and integration services rendered under such contracts  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
we will review  on a quarterly basis  the total estimated remaining costs to completion for each of these contracts and apply the impact of any changes on the poc prospectively 
if at any time we anticipate that the estimated remaining costs to completion will exceed the value of the contract  the loss will be recognized immediately 
when circumstances exist that prevent us from making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenues  we account for sales under such long term contracts using the completed contract method 
sales to resellers and channel partners we execute certain sales contracts through resellers and distributors collectively  resellers and also large  well capitalized partners such as sap ag and accenture inc collectively  channel partners 
we recognize revenue relating to sales through resellers when all the recognition criteria have been met in other words  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred in the reporting period  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
typically  we recognize revenue to resellers only after the reseller communicates the occurrence of end user sales to us  since we do not have privity of contract with the end user 
in addition we assess the creditworthiness of each reseller and if the reseller is newly formed  undercapitalized or in financial difficulty any revenues expected to emanate from such resellers are deferred and recognized only when cash is received and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue relating to sales through channel partners in the reporting period in which we receive evidence  from the channel partner  of end user sales collectively  the documentation and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as a result  if the documentation is not received within a given reporting period we recognize the revenue in a period subsequent to the period in which the channel partner completes the sale to the end user

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
on july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions under fas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize 
the amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized 
the tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not capable of being sustained 
on subsequent recognition and measurement the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the company s best estimate  given the information available at the reporting date  although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final 
we did not recognize an increase in our net liability for unrecognized tax obligations  or record a change to the balance of retained earnings  as a result of the adoption of fin upon adoption of fin  we elected to follow an accounting policy to classify accrued interest related to liabilities for income taxes within the interest expense line and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the other expense line of our consolidated statements of income see note for more details 
fair value of financial instruments carrying amounts of certain financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable trade and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization 
the fair value of our total long term debt approximates its carrying value 
financial instruments and hedge accounting we follow the provisions of fasb sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended sfas 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending upon whether the derivative is part of a hedge transaction and meets specific hedge accounting criteria

the recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sub lease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of

litigation we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure

share based payment on july   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee share based compensation arrangements under the provisions of fasb  sfas revised and share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transitional method 
previously  we had elected to account for employee share based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
under the modified prospective transitional method  share based compensation is recognized for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
in addition  share based compensation is recognized  subsequent to the adoption of sfas r  for the remaining portion of the vesting period if any for outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption 
we measure share based compensation costs on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period  which in our circumstances is the stated vesting period of the award  provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known

special charges recoveries fiscal restructuring plan in december  in the immediate aftermath of the hummingbird acquisition  we commenced restructuring activities to streamline the operations of the legacy open text activities 
this streamlining involved primarily work force reductions and consolidation of excess facilities 
this is separate  in accounting terms  from the initiative to restructure legacy hummingbird activities discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
in fiscal we incurred a total cash outlay of million relating to this plan 
accretion of acquisition related facility accrual in june  based upon our review of our estimates of our future sub lease income  which are embedded in our estimate of accruals for excess facility obligations  we reduced our original estimate for future sub lease income relating to an excess facility we acquired as part of the ixos acquisition 
the subject facility is a relatively large facility located outside munich  germany  in a town called grasbrunn  measuring approximately  square meters 
the relatively large size severely impacted our ability to further sub lease the facility and  in combination with a real estate vacancy rate in grasbrunn of compared to in the greater munich area  caused us to review the original estimate of the sub lease income critically 
in accordance with the accounting rules relating to accounting for acquisitions  the original acquisition related accrual for this facility was reduced by an estimate for future sub lease income 
these rules also require that any accretions to the original estimate  occurring one year after the date of the acquisition  be charged to operating expenses in the period in which such accretions are determined 
as the ixos acquisition occurred in march  we have  accordingly  included an amount of million within special charges in fiscal  on account of the revision of our original estimate of sub lease income 
in addition to the above mentioned factors the additional trigger events that caused us to increase the estimate of accrual and reduce the estimate of sub lease income were as follows the time remaining to lease the facility the lease for this facility expires on march  the necessary timeframe to complete a sublet transaction  regardless of its size  can be anywhere between twelve to thirty six months including contract negotiation  construction of leasehold improvements and moving before any sublet revenue is realized and consequently the relatively short timeframe remaining between today and march is adversely affecting our ability to attract sub tenants 
during fiscal  we changed our marketing strategy  in this regard  to find tenants willing to take any size of space  not just tenants willing to take full floors or the entire facility 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal we implemented a potential additional change to our sub tenant marketing strategy in that we would be willing to consider not just parceling out the property to smaller sub tenants as indicated above but also  the possibility of reducing the sub rental rates further 
based upon the above factors  and an analysis of the relative probability of various potential sub lease scenarios that could occur  our best estimate of the potential impact of the reduction in the original estimate of sub lease income was determined to be million  which was charged to the operating expenses of fiscal we will review this estimate on a quarterly basis and either accrete or reduce the accrual as necessary during future fiscal periods  up to the end of the lease in march impairment of intangible assets during the year ended june  and  impairment charges of  and million  respectively  were recorded relating to a write down of certain intellectual property in north america 
the intellectual property represents the fair value of acquired technology from the corechange acquisition which closed in the fiscal year 
the triggering event that gave rise to the impairments was a shift in the marketing and development strategy associated with the intellectual property and our assessment of the acquired technology relative to its product lifecycle 
the impairments were measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted projected future net cash flows 
for more details on special charges recoveries  see note net interest expense net interest expense increased by million predominantly due to the interest expense incurred on the long term debt acquired during fiscal to partially finance the hummingbird acquisition 
income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal this equates to an effective tax rate of in fiscal versus an effective tax rate of in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal versus the preceding fiscal year is in part due to higher taxable income in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the canadian statutory rate and in part due to the use of deferred tax assets which had a valuation allowance recorded against it in the prior year 
our deferred tax assets totaling million are based upon available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon us generating income in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the recognized deferred tax liability of million is primarily made up of four components 
the first component relates to the net addition of the deferred tax liability associated with hummingbird s identifiable intangible assets of million 
the second component relates to million arising from other acquired identifiable intangible assets 
the third component of million relates primarily to deferred credits arising from non capital losses and undeducted scientific research and experimental development expenditures acquired at a discount on asset acquisitions  which will be included in income as they are utilized 
the fourth component of million relates to a deferred tax liability arising from investment tax credits 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect of our deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  
this valuation allowance is primarily attributable to valuation allowances set up based on losses incurred in the current and prior years 
in order to fully utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets of million  we will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million in fiscal due to an increase in net income of million  an increase in non cash adjustments of million and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in non cash adjustments of million was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of million relating to intangible assets and capital assets acquired on account of hummingbird  and offset by the following i a deferred tax recovery relating to the amortization of acquired intangible assets of million  ii a reduction of asset impairments of million  and iii miscellaneous items 
the increase in operating assets and liabilities of million is primarily due to higher accrued liabilities and accounts payable in the amount of million and increased deferred revenue balances of million  both these increases are largely due to the increased scale of operations resulting from the hummingbird acquisition 
the rest of the change is due to the offsetting impacts of miscellaneous items of working capital 
net cash used in investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily on account of business acquisitions 
in addition  in the aftermath of our more significant acquisitions  such as ixos and hummingbird  we typically implement exit plans for reduction of legacy workforces and legacy real estate facilities of the acquired company 
these plans are set up in accordance with the accounting rules governing acquisition related accruals 
payments against these accruals are recorded as a use of cash in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to incremental payments made for the hummingbird acquisition in the amount of million  purchase of momentum for million  payments for acquisition related accruals of million  offset by reduced spending on capital assets of million and other miscellaneous reductions in investing activities 
in accordance with the accounting rules for setting up acquisition related accruals  we set up accruals in the amount of million relating to an exit plan for workforce reductions of legacy hummingbird employees and abandonment of legacy hummingbird facilities 
during fiscal we made cash payments of approximately million relating to these accruals 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing increased by approximately million in fiscal primarily due to a net increase in long term debt of million and proceeds from the issuance of shares under our stock option and employee share purchase plans of million 
the overall increase was offset by million of debt issuance costs 
the increase in long term debt is on account of a seven year debt facility obtained from a canadian chartered bank in the amount of million against which we incurred million of debt issuance costs 
long term debt and credit facilities term loan as of june   the carrying value of the term loan was million and we were in compliance with all loan covenants relating to this facility  at that date 
during fiscal we made a prepayment of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relate primarily to our term loan  as we had no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit as of june  as of june  we had an outstanding balance of million on this loan 
the term loan bears a floating interest rate of libor plus a fixed rate of 
as of june   an adverse change in libor of basis points would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the term loan by approximately million  absent the impact of our interest rate collar referred to below and assuming that the loan balance as of june  is outstanding for the entire period 
we manage our interest rate exposure  relating to million of the above mentioned term loan  with an interest rate collar that partially hedges the fluctuation in libor 
the collar has a notional value of million  a cap rate of and a floor rate of 
this has the effect of circumscribing our maximum floating interest rate risk within the range of to 
the collar expires in december foreign currency risk our reporting currency is the u 
s dollar 
on account of our international operations  a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents is held in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of june   this balance represented approximately of our total cash and cash equivalents 
a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would have decreased our reported cash and cash equivalents by approximately 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from subsidiaries  other than those located in the u 
s  are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
these functional currencies include euros  canadian dollars  swiss francs and british pounds 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the foreign currency conversion of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income loss for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income loss will increase for our international operations  if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we cannot predict the effect foreign exchange fluctuations will have on our results going forward 
however  if there is a change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar  it could have a material effect on our results of operations
