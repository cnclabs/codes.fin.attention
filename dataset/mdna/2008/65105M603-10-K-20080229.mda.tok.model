table of contents taxation we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner 
our current and continuing qualification as a reit depends on our ability to meet various tax law requirements  including  among others  requirements relating to the sources of our income  the nature of our assets  the composition of our stockholders  and the timing and amount of distributions that we make 
as a reit  we will generally not be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders 
we may  however  nevertheless be subject to certain state  local and foreign income and other taxes  and to us federal income and excise taxes and penalties in certain situations  including taxes on our undistributed income 
in addition  our stockholders may be subject to state  local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions  including those in which they or we transact business or reside 
the state  local and foreign tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment 
if  in any taxable year  we fail to satisfy one or more of the various tax law requirements  we could fail to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for a particular tax year  our income in that year would be subject to us federal corporate income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax  and we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax  and we would not be compelled by the code to make distributions 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other developments may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit  or may cause our board of directors to revoke the reit election 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable 
actual results have been in line with management s estimates and judgements used in applying each of the accounting policies described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note to ou r consolidated financial statements  which appear in part ii
