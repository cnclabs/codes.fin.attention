part i item business we are an important provider of blast and ballistic protected products used to support armed forces and security personnel in harm s way 
we design  manufacture  test  deliver and support our blast and ballistic protected products to increase survivability of the users of our products 
our specialty vehicles  which we believe are at the forefront of blast and ballistic protected technology  are designed to protect their occupants from landmines  hostile fire  and improvised explosive devices ieds 
we are an important provider of vehicles for the us military s mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program  which is currently one of the highest priority acquisition programs for the us department of defense dod according to a memorandum from secretary of defense robert gates dated may  during the period from january  through december   we delivered vehicles under blast and ballistic protected vehicle programs 
during the period from january  through december   we delivered  vehicles under the mrap and other blast and ballistic protected vehicle programs  including vehicles manufactured pursuant to the terms of our gdls subcontract with general dynamics land systems inc described in this item  major contracts below  under the mrap competitive contract described in this item  major contracts below 
for the year ended december   we reported net sales of million  up from our net sales of million reported for the year ended december  during the period from january  through june   we received additional orders for vehicles  including vehicles to be manufactured pursuant to the terms of our gdls subcontract 
during this same period we delivered  vehicles under the mrap and other blast and ballistic protected vehicle programs  including vehicles manufactured pursuant to the terms of the gdls subcontract 
at june   we had outstanding orders for vehicles  including vehicles to be manufactured pursuant to the terms of our gdls subcontract 
our products since the early stages of operation iraqi and operation enduring freedom  the us military has sought a wheeled vehicle approach that balances three potentially competing operational or mission dynamics i payload  which refers to the load that the vehicles allow using units to carry on board the platform  such as crew members and cargo  ii performance  which refers to a vehicle s automotive 
table of contents mobility and its suitability for transportation in existing military aircraft and ships  and iii protection  which refers to the level of crew survivability against blast and ballistic attack 
we currently have four vehicle types aimed at fulfilling different operational or mission requirements the buffalo  the cougar  the cougar lightweight cougar restricted terrain  and the cheetah 
the buffalo 
the buffalo mine protected clearance vehicle mpcv  with a gross vehicle weight of approximately tons  is our largest vehicle and is designed primarily for use in conducting route clearance operations 
during these operations  friendly forces patrol areas and routes of likely enemy ieds and landmine activity searching for concealed explosive devices 
the buffalo has six wheels and is equipped with a hydraulic arm used to interrogate suspect devices while allowing the crew to disable or destroy the device from within the vehicle 
the vehicle s capsule is blast resistant  and the bottom of its passenger compartment is v shaped which we refer to as a v shaped hull and is designed to deflect and dissipate the explosive blast from a landmine or ieds away from the passenger compartment  thus helping protect the occupants from harm 
with the buffalo  we have been designated by the us army and us marine corps as the sole source supplier of vehicles for explosive ordnance disposal eod  including eod vehicles that satisfy the category iii requirements of the mrap program  under the ground standoff mine detection system gstamids and mrap programs  respectively 
in addition to producing buffalos for the us military  on february  we were awarded a contract through the dod s fms program to produce four buffalos for the italian military 
the cougar 
the cougar is a family of medium sized blast and ballistic protected vehicles that can be supplied in wheeled and wheeled variants and in a variety of configurations for the wide range of missions performed by our customers 
with a gross vehicle weight that ranges from tons to tons  depending on the variant  the operational applications of the cougar include troop transport  command and control  route reconnaissance  convoy escort  and ambulance duty 
similar to the buffalo  the cougar employs a v shaped hull designed to deflect blast energy  along with a blast and ballistic protected steel passenger compartment providing blast and ballistic protection 
the cougar family of vehicles offers our customers the ability to enhance the protection and payload offered to wheeled vehicle platforms  while still offering acceptable levels of performance 
in comparison  armored combat platforms  such as main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles  offer substantial levels of protection but lesser relative levels of payload and performance  and light unarmored wheeled vehicles eg utility vehicles such as the high mobility multi purpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv  and other non tactical wheeled vehicles used for supply and support functions offer higher levels of performance but lesser relative levels of protection 
in addition to producing cougars for the us military  we manufacture several variants for us foreign military allies  including the canadian military  the italian military  the united kingdom ministry of defence and the iraqi national army 
the cougar lightweight cougar restricted terrain 
the cougar lightweight cougar restricted terrain is a new class of vehicle developed in response to an urgent request to develop vehicles providing enhanced mobility while maintaining survivability 
although this new class of vehicle is derived from our successful cougar platform  it incorporates significant amounts of design and technology developed as part of the cheetah platform 
achieving lighter base vehicle weight with higher available horsepower without sacrificing survivability gives our customer the flexibility to use the increased available payload and power to carry additional operation equipment and or exterior armor solutions like our force armor for defeating explosively formed penetrators efps  a variant of ieds 
the lighter base vehicle weight also increases the mobility and maneuverability of the vehicle  
table of contents increasing the overall utility of our cougar as operational requirements change 
on september   the united states marine corps made a contract award for of these vehicles under the mrap competitive contract 
the cheetah 
the cheetah is a wheeled vehicle with a curb weight of approximately tons  designed specifically for reconnaissance  forward command and control  and urban operations 
the cheetah provides performance levels similar to that of a light wheeled vehicle  while providing protection levels similar to that of our heavier cougar fleet and payload levels substantially higher than that of the wheeled vehicle fleet currently available to the military 
for example  the cheetah offers mobility comparable to the hmmwv  and is transportable in any transport aircraft in the military inventory  including the c a four engine turboprop transport aircraft  as well as externally by a variety of helicopters 
we believe the cheetah represents a significant evolution in blast and ballistic protected vehicles that we believe may fill a void in vehicle platforms currently available to the military  specifically the gap between light unarmored or even lightly armored wheeled vehicles and the fleet of mrap vehicles currently fielded by the military 
at present  we have not had any orders for the cheetah  although on september   we submitted a response to a tacom request for information 
life cycle support 
we offer ongoing life cycle support in the areas of spare parts  maintenance  and training for our vehicles 
as of june   we had delivered an aggregate of over  vehicles to our customers across our buffalo and cougar product lines 
accordingly  we believe that we have a substantial business opportunity to provide life cycle support to our existing and future fleet of vehicles 
in addition  as the fleet ages  we have the opportunity to offer upgrades and product improvements for our fleet that are designed to further enhance the operability and capability of the vehicles 
we believe this will continue to provide us with an ongoing market to sustain and improve our fleet through contractor logistical support  remanufacturing  and retrofitting 
armor kit force armor 
we offer an external ballistic protection module ebpm identified as force armor that provides additional protection from efps  as well as from attack by rocket propelled grenades 
the ebpm package design has been tested and validated through the us army aberdeen test center 
the ebpm package can readily be installed and removed in the field allowing user units to scale protection levels in response to likely enemy threats 
as a result of its modularity  the ebpm package can also be retrofitted to our previously deployed vehicles as well as to wheeled vehicles manufactured by other companies 
we currently provide an ebpm package on remaining vehicles to be delivered under our mrap competitive contract as of june   vehicles remain to be delivered 
vehicle deliveries and backlog the following tables set forth the number of vehicles delivered for the respective periods shown below and the total number of vehicles included in our backlog as of december  and june   including vehicles manufactured or to be manufactured  as appropriate  by gdls under the gdls subcontract 
no vehicles were manufactured under the gdls subcontract prior to the third quarter of the backlog shown in the following table is funded backlog  meaning that it reflects vehicles for which we have received orders and for which funding has been appropriated and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency

industry overview and force protection market opportunity general 
we believe the world market for blast and ballistic protected military vehicles and other survivability solutions is growing rapidly 
the global war on terrorism  especially in iraq and afghanistan  has confirmed that ieds  roadside bombs and landmines pose a significant threat to military personnel and civilians 
landmines and ieds have been used extensively by terrorists and insurgent groups in iraq and other areas because of their highly effective nature and relatively low cost 
as vehicles are fielded with a specific level of protection  insurgent forces attempt to find alternative ways to conduct attacks 
this will further evolve as better vehicular protection is designed and leads to potentially new threats eg anti personnel weapons  hand held efps which will generate the need for an ever expanding field of survivability solutions 
according to a government accountability office gao report dated july   over of the casualties suffered by us forces in operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom in afghanistan have been caused by ieds 
vehicles that move troops or ordnance while providing significant protection against blast and ballistic threats  landmine hazards and ieds  or that are capable of mine clearance operations  are critical in these situations 
missions for these vehicles range from troop transport in and around unexploded ordnance or mine threat areas to route clearance  convoy escort  reconnaissance  command and control  ambulance operations  eod operations  general utility  and humanitarian de mining 
in late  the us military began acquiring modern blast and ballistic resistant wheeled vehicles in order to counter the effect of ied attacks on friendly forces conducting missions in iraq and afghanistan 
these missions have often involved the use of lightweight wheeled utility vehicles  including the hmmwv 
the hmmwv  however  was not designed to sustain high powered explosive blasts and is vulnerable to enemy fire 
in response to the increasing number of casualties from ieds and other explosive devices sustained during operation enduring freedom in afghanistan and operation iraqi freedom  the us military sought to increase the armor and blast protection of many of its wheeled vehicles  including the hmmwv  by retrofitting them with heavy armor 
however  
table of contents retrofitting heavier armor onto the bodies of these normally lightly armored vehicles is costly  and the added weight both increases mechanical wear and reduces the payload of the vehicles 
we delivered buffalos and cougars in response to the us military demand 
mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program 
in  the us effort to acquire blast and ballistic protected vehicles evolved into the establishment of the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle program 
the dod accelerated the pace of contract awards under this program in early  and on may  the secretary of defense  robert gates  directed that the mrap program be considered the highest priority dod acquisition program 
in june  secretary of defense gates provided the mrap program with the highest priority access to components and materials among all defense acquisition programs and assigned the mrap program a dx rating  which is the highest priority rating under the dod priority on allocation system 
on june   a congressional research service report on the mrap program identified that the joint requirements oversight council jroc in september had approved the procurement of a total of  mrap vehicles 
this same report noted  however  that the jroc suggested that these numbers could change  based on assessment of commanders 
according to a report dated july  from the gao  the dod had placed orders for  mrap category i and category ii vehicles with five suppliers  of which we received orders for  vehicles 
as a result  we estimate that as of june  the us military would have been permitted to order an additional  vehicles under the mrap program 
according to that same gao report  the dod has appropriated more than billion to acquire mrap vehicles 
as a result and based on expanded operations into the afghanistan theater of operations  we believe there is potential for additional mrap vehicles to be approved for procurement by the us military under the mrap program 
the us marine corps established a joint program office jpo in to manage the mrap program for all branches of the us military and  as part of that program  continues to procure wheeled vehicles that offer more effective blast protection for the military personnel of the us armed forces 
the mrap program specifies three categories of vehicles  as outlined in the table below 
the table also indicates which of our vehicles satisfy the criteria for each of these categories 
vehicle type description force protection vehicle category i transports no less than six persons and must be suitable for urban operations cougar wheeled variant cheetah cougar lightweight cougar restricted terrain category ii transports no less than ten persons and has multi mission purposes including troop transport  command and control and route reconnaissance cougar wheeled variant category iii transports no less than six persons and is designed to conduct eod and route clearance missions buffalo under the mrap program  we submitted bids in response to requests for proposals rfps  to the us marine corps for two different categories of armored vehicles 
we have received two contracts under the mrap program 
in november  the us marine corps awarded a sole source contract to us for category ii cougar x vehicles and category iii buffalo vehicles  which as of june  was for an aggregate of cougars and buffalos 
in january  the us marine corps awarded us a competitive contract for category i and category ii vehicles 
this contract allows the government to acquire up to  vehicles over a year period 
as of december   the us marine corps 
table of contents had placed seven delivery orders from us against this competitive contract for a total of  category i vehicles and category ii vehicles 
an additional order for mrap vehicles was received in for category i and six category ii vehicles 
with the buffalo  we have been designated by the us army and us marine corps as the sole source supplier of vehicles for eod  including eod vehicles that satisfy the category iii requirements of the mrap program  under the ground standoff mine detection system gstamids and mrap programs  respectively 
mrap ii program 
under the mrap ii program  the us military is seeking vehicles smaller than the cougar that afford better protection to their occupants 
on october   we submitted a cheetah vehicle in response to the dod s vehicle solicitation for the mrap ii program 
on june   we received notice that the cheetah was not selected for this solicitation 
however  we understand that this program has been suspended indefinitely 
joint light tactical vehicle jltv program 
under the jltv program  the us military is seeking a family of vehicles that fulfill mission role gaps identified from the current hmmwv program 
the jltv program specifies three categories of vehicles based on payload 
the performance  protection and physical characteristics of these vehicle categories are tailored to fulfill the specified mission roles these vehicles will be required to execute 
on july   a briefing by the army staff on the us army and us marine corps tactical wheeled vehicle fleet strategy indicated that the demand for new light tactical vehicles is approximately  vehicles between the us army and the us marine corps 
the us army s light tactical wheeled vehicle budget states that following further development and testing  the dod intends to replace portions of the hmmwv with a new fleet of vehicles under the jltv program 
the jltv program is expected to require vehicles to balance increased levels of protection and survivability with mobility and transportability requirements 
this same briefing indicates that the us army will spend an estimated billion per year on the jltv program 
on february   we entered into an exclusive teaming agreement with drs technologies  inc drs  whereby drs will serve as prime contractor and we will serve as a subcontractor for awards under the jltv program 
on april   we submitted the cheetah for consideration under the jltv program as subcontractor to drs 
on august   we were informed that we were no longer in consideration for the jltv program milestone a technology demonstration phase 
we will continue to pursue opportunities on the jltv program by working with milestone a vendors to determine whether there are potential fits for force protection technology eg force armor 
in addition  we will continue to monitor the jltv program as it transitions from milestone a to milestone b system development phase in fiscal years with a view to reentering the competition 
ground standoff mine detection system gstamids program 
the ground standoff mine detection system program is aimed at fielding newly established route clearance companies for the purposes of conducting ied clearing operations to eliminate ied threats to friendly force mobility in theaters of operations 
with the buffalo  we have been designated by the us army and us marine corps as the sole source supplier of vehicles for eod  including eod vehicles that satisfy the category iii requirements of the mrap program  under the gstamids and mrap programs  respectively 
foreign military sales fms program 
the dod established the fms program to manage government to government purchases of weapons and other defense articles  defense services  and military training 
a foreign military buying weapons through the fms program does not contract directly with the company that makes them 
instead  the dod serves as an intermediary  usually handling procurement  logistics and delivery 
in  we also entered into a subcontract with bae systems land armaments lp bae to provide cougar ilav vehicles for the iraqi national army  and a contract with the dod to provide cougar mastiff vehicles to the united kingdom 
table of contents ministry of defence through the dod s fms programs 
in  we entered into contracts with the dod to provide buffalo and cougar vehicles to the canadian ministry of defence through the fms program 
in  we entered into contracts with the dod to provide buffalo and cougar vehicles to the italian ministry of defence and cougar mastiff and ridgbacks vehicles to the united kingdom ministry of defence through the fms program 
a may briefing by united kingdom ministry of defence indicated that the united kingdom ministry of defence is considering making their cougar mastiff and cougar ridgback fleets a long term component in the united kingdom ministry of defence 
the original vision for the cougar mastiffs had been a stopgap program under which the vehicles were likely to be disposed of at the end of the combat deployments in iraq and afghanistan 
as a result of the successful operational performance the united kingdom experienced in combat operations  it decided to retain the vehicles and expand their fleet in order to maintain this capability within the united kingdom ministry of defence for a longer term 
it is our belief this will provide ongoing opportunities for sustainment and upgrade of the cougar fleet in the united kingdom 
miscellaneous opportunities 
in addition  many countries have buried landmines as a result of their use as a defensive tactic in areas of enemy egress during the cold war and in third world civil and international warfare during the s and s 
in  the number of landmines planted around the world was estimated to be million with another million estimated to be stockpiled by various nations around the world 
as a result  humanitarian de mining operations may become a potential market for our products in order to enable nations to safely clear their land of buried landmines in order to facilitate agricultural and commercial enterprise 
business strengths survivability performance 
our buffalo and cougar blast and ballistic protected vehicles have been deployed with the us and allied forces in iraq and afghanistan since we believe our vehicles are the most survivable and sustainable vehicles on the battlefield 
according to our internal data  as of september our vehicles have logged in excess of approximately  days in combat operations and sustained approximately  ied and landmine blasts during the course of their active duty 
the advanced design and engineering incorporated into our vehicles increases the survivability rate of vehicle occupants in conflict with a hostile force 
in addition  the structural integrity of the passenger compartment and our use of readily available automotive parts helps our vehicles to be quickly repaired and returned to duty after sustaining damage from an attack 
as a result  our field data indicates over of our vehicles delivered since are still in operation  and the us military reports operational availability for those vehicles in excess of 
scalable manufacturing capabilities 
we have developed a process driven  scalable manufacturing operation that enables us to design and build vehicles with increased efficiency 
together with key partner and subcontractor relationships  we are able to rapidly expand our production capabilities to meet customer demands 
this approach enables us to expand production capacity while reducing our capital investment requirements 
proprietary technology and commitment to research and development 
our proprietary designs are derived from concepts that were initially developed outside the united states over thirty years ago to protect vehicle occupants against the threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance 
we have continuously improved upon our proprietary designs through internally funded research  development and testing 
we actively seek to protect our designs through our intellectual property rights 
we believe our focus in these areas enables us to remain flexible in our design processes and improve our vehicle sustainability and performance 
demonstrated ability to anticipate customer requirements 
as one of the first us based manufacturers of the current generation of blast and ballistic protected vehicles  we believe we are a leader in technological innovation in this industry 
our expertise enables us to produce a range of 
table of contents vehicles that serve a variety of missions  and are capable of withstanding increasingly violent attacks from a constantly evolving threat 
we believe we will continue to be able to proactively anticipate the needs of our customers and manufacture vehicles that exceed their operational requirements 
for example  we initiated the design and testing of our cheetah vehicle in  two years prior to the official request by the us military for a higher mobility blast resistant wheeled vehicle under the mrap ii solicitation in july in addition  we started the development of the efp program in  two years prior to the official request by the us marine corps for an exterior armor kit to be added to our mrap vehicles 
strong customer relationships 
we generate substantially all of our revenue from sales to the dod 
as a result  we have developed strong relationships with the us marine corps  the united kingdom ministry of defence  as well as other us military branches and foreign military allies of the us we believe that these relationships and the performance of our vehicles in the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan will provide us with an significant advantage as we compete for future government contracts 
our buffalo is a us army program of record 
experienced management team 
our success is due in large part to the broad experience and knowledge of our management team and key personnel 
our executive management team has expertise in automotive engineering  manufacturing and government contracting  and brings to the organization extensive knowledge of our customers 
in order to keep pace with the growth of our business  we have recently strengthened our management team through the addition of several key personnel 
business strategy our business strategy is built around three main imperatives i first  constant focus on innovation and the introduction of new survivability products and solutions  ii second  expand our customer base  and iii third  procure contracts for sustainment services of our fleet of vehicles across all customers 
specific components of the strategy include the following identify new products and markets to meet evolving customer requirements 
we plan to continue to maintain a strong emphasis on the development of new products and improved technology and believe that our ongoing commitment to research and development will better position us to anticipate the future needs of our customers 
capitalize on demand for blast and ballistic protected vehicles and other survivability solutions 
the ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan against an innovative enemy have been the primary factor driving demand for our vehicles 
our marketing efforts focus on the sale of vehicles to the us military and  with authorization from the us government  to foreign allies of the united states 
we also intend to expand our vehicle offerings by designing new variants and implementing model changes within the current fleet as we seek to anticipate evolving customer requirements 
expanding our service and support network 
we are experiencing an increase in the portion of our revenues generated by the sale of sustainment service  for example  spare parts  field service and training  for our growing fleet of deployed vehicles 
due to the nature of their mission  we expect a significant number of our vehicles will need to be repaired either in the field or upon return from deployment 
in order to maintain high levels of customer support  we intend to continue to increase the number of our field service personnel domestically and internationally 
focus on core competencies 
we are making investments in mainstream and newstream innovation capabilities 
mainstream refers to our ability to maintain  improve and evolve our current vehicle platforms with a focus on survivability  sustainability and availability 
mainstream also refers to our ability to understand our current customer s evolving operational needs and to provide whole system solutions beyond standard vehicle platforms to meet these requirements 
newstream refers to our ability to innovate new survivability solutions outside our core vehicle platform base 
our new force armor efp protection is an example of this effort 

table of contents leverage key relationships to grow our business 
we have developed strong relationships with the us marine corps  the united kingdom ministry of defence  domestic and certain other foreign military customers 
we believe that these relationships and the performance of our vehicles in the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan will give us an advantage as we compete for future government contracts 
customer activity our primary customer is the dod through which we directly and indirectly service us military branches primarily  the us army and the us marine corps and indirectly service foreign military allies of the us through the dod s fms program 
we have field service representatives deployed in iraq  afghanistan and the united kingdom to provide customer support of our arrangements directly or indirectly through the dod s fms program 
the following table sets forth the number of vehicles we sold in the respective periods shown below  including cougar mrap competitive vehicles manufactured by gdls under our gdls subcontract 
no vehicles were manufactured under our gdls subcontract prior to the third quarter of vehicle january june buffalo cougar hev cougar jerrv cougar mrap sole source cougar mrap competitive cougar ilav iraq cougar mastiff united kingdom ministry of defence cougar united kingdom ministry of defence cougar canada total competitive positioning we are subject to significant competition from companies that market and manufacture armored vehicles  as well as other companies that supply spare parts for armored vehicles and sustainment 
this competition could harm our ability to win business and increase the price pressure on our products 
the companies we compete against include large  multinational vehicle  defense and aerospace firms such as bae systems land armaments  lp including its newly acquired subsidiary  armor holdings  textron inc  international military and government llc  a subsidiary of navistar international corporation  oshkosh corporation  mantech services uk ltd  raytheon company  aerospace and general dynamics land systems inc most of our competitors have considerably greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we do  which may make it difficult for us to win new contracts  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
certain competitors operate fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion  manufacturing and sale of their products 

table of contents we believe our competitive advantages include the level of blast and ballistic protection incorporated into our vehicles  which increases the survivability of the occupants and repairability of the vehicles  the fact that our vehicles are currently deployed in iraq and afghanistan and have a well established track record of performance since  our ability to innovate survivability solutions to defeat new and emerging threats of attack  our ability to innovate lightweight  mobile blast and ballistic protected vehicles to anticipate and meet developing customer requirements  the fact that our vehicles use many off the shelf automotive components that facilitate service  and the prior testing and acceptance of our buffalo and cougar vehicles and our ebpm by the us military 
we believe our products are superior to many other wheeled vehicles currently in use by the us military in terms of mine and blast protection because of their survivability and repairability 
existing us wheeled military vehicles include hmmwv and other non armored utility support vehicles 
us military tracked vehicles meaning that they have treads instead of wheels include heavyweight troop transport and offensive armor such as the bradley fighting vehicle bradley  and the ma abrams tank abrams 
the lightly armored and un armored hmmwv and other wheeled vehicles can be subject to attacks and efforts to up armor these vehicles have not been completely successful due to the costs associated with retrofitting armor onto the body of the vehicle and the increased mechanical wear caused by the weight of the armor 
conventional tracked armored vehicles such as the bradley and the abrams offer protection from blast and ballistic threats  but are expensive  require substantial resources to maintain  are large and can be difficult to maneuver in urban environments and may not be well suited to peace keeping missions due to their intimidating offensive weapon systems

production the key components of our manufacturing process are the following we utilize proprietary technology to design and manufacture blast and ballistic protected vehicle passenger compartments  which we sometimes refer to as capsules  that we believe are capable of withstanding the explosive effects of landmines  ieds and other blast threats encountered in wars  insurgency and urban conflicts  we use commercial american made automotive drivetrains and certain other components that can be repaired and maintained by traditional truck mechanics  although certain of our components are manufactured abroad or are in limited supply  our workforce includes skilled welders and automotive mechanics  we maintain a staff of engineers to provide in house engineering support and utilize various manufacturing approaches to increase efficiency and product quality  
table of contents we utilize partners and subcontractors  including gdls  to expand our capacity and capabilities to meet customer specifications  standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs  and we source steel and other raw material from various key vendors in the united states and overseas  and secure our automotive components from a variety of us suppliers including caterpillar  mack trucks  a member of the volvo group  and allison transmission and in certain cases  from foreign suppliers 
we currently obtain all of the steel for the buffalo vehicle from foreign suppliers and for our other vehicles  substantially from domestic suppliers 
the next generation buffalo  currently in testing with the us army  will incorporate domestic steel in place of foreign steel 
sales and marketing our employees  including senior management and our vice presidents of marketing  business development  and program management  conduct our primary sales and marketing efforts 
apart from our senior management  our primary sales staff consists of employees who reside in south carolina  virginia and connecticut 
we also have consultants and representatives in south africa  the united kingdom  turkey  japan  poland and the united arab emirates  these representatives facilitate our business development activities in their respective countries and serve as local subject matter experts in helping us to better understand local requirements and practices in our efforts to establish markets overseas 
we actively participate in shows involving countermine operations and technology  military vehicles  law enforcement technology and military force protection  including the association of the us army annual meeting  winter symposium  modern marine expo  and tactical wheeled vehicle conferences 
additionally  our marketing efforts include advertising focused on the military community and brochures 
sales to the us government for each of and and the six months ended june   substantially all of our net sales were derived from work performed directly or indirectly under us government contracts 
government contracts and regulation we are a dod contractor that delivers products and services to all of the branches of the us military 
the us government contracting process differs in many ways from commercial contracting  and involves a high degree of federal government regulation and oversight of the programs in which we participate 
as a result  we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the us government agencies and entities that govern these programs  including award  administration and performance of contracts 
we are also subject to certain unique business risks associated with the us government program funding and appropriations and government contracts 
us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far  which sets forth policies  procedures  and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government  agency specific regulations that implement or supplement the far  such as the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars  and other applicable laws and regulations 
these statutes and regulations impose a broad range of requirements  many of which are unique to government contracting  including various procurement  import and export  security  contract pricing and cost  contract termination and adjustment  and audit requirements 
a contractor s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts  contract modifications or termination  and the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 

table of contents in addition  us government contractors that perform military programs are also subject to audits and investigations by us government agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa  the dod inspector general  and other government entities 
us government agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
these entities also review the adequacy of compliance with internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems  as well as possible instances of fraud  waste  and abuse 
additionally  each fiscal year  we must submit final cost data to the federal government indicating our actual costs incurred for the prior year  exclusive of certain costs that are not recoverable by federal government contractors 
once audited  the us government may adjust the amounts on certain contracts  based upon established guidance  which may affect our recovery 
these audits may also result  in among other things  price reductions  assessment of penalties  interest costs  or even potential debarment from participation in the federal procurement system 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of certain additional risks associated with us government contract regulations and requirements compliance 
generally  congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations and agencies determine a continued need for the specific program 
the contracts under a program generally are subject to termination or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or change or the applicable agency s budgeting priorities change 
additionally  the us government is required to equitably adjust a contract price for additions or reductions in scope or other changes directed by the applicable agency 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of additional risks associated with program funding and appropriations 
in most federal procurements  interested contractors submit information indicating their desire to provide the required goods 
the agency then solicits competitive proposals or bids from qualified contractors by the publication of a formal rfp 
the rfp typically describes the desired goods  terms and conditions  and evaluation criteria that the agency will use 
then  the interested contractors  called offerors  submit proposals in response to an rfp  and the agency evaluates the proposals and makes the award determination 
the amount of time for a procurement to be completed from notification of the rfp to award can range from several months to a year or more 
the government contracts for which we compete typically have multiple year terms  and if we are unable to win a particular contract  we generally will be excluded from competing again for that contract until its expiration several years later 
in addition  upon the expiration of a contract  if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract  there is frequently a competitive re procurement process 
most of our contracts are fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  the contractor agrees to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed price 
as a result  the contractor benefits from any cost savings but suffers from any losses from any cost overruns 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with fixed price contracts 
in addition we also hold id iq contracts 
essentially  the id iq contracts are umbrella contracts setting forth the basic terms and conditions under which the agency may order goods from a contractor  and in some cases  multiple contractors 
contractors undergo a competitive preselection process to become eligible to receive orders under id iq contracts 
in addition  id iq contracts do not obligate the federal government to purchase goods above the minimum levels set forth in the contract 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for a discussion of the risk associated with id iq contracts 

table of contents us government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience  where the government no longer has a need for the service  or for default  usually based on deficiencies in performance 
generally  if a contract is terminated for convenience  the contractor is entitled to payments for some or all of its allowable costs incurred in performing the work that was terminated and may receive some allowance for profit on the work performed 
if a contract is terminated for default  the contractor is generally entitled to payments for its work that has been accepted by the government 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain additional risks associated with the us government s right to terminate its contracts 
certain laws and regulations affecting our business there are certain federal laws that  while not specifically directed at us as a contractor  may affect our us government contracts 
the anti deficiency act is a collection of laws through which congress exercises its constitutional control of the public purse 
the central provision  codified at usc  prohibits making or authorizing an expenditure from  or creating or authorizing an obligation under  any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the appropriation or fund unless authorized by law 
the anti deficiency act also prohibits involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose  unless otherwise allowed by law 
generally  therefore  agencies cannot fund our contracts unless there has been a full appropriation of the necessary funds 
congress appropriates the majority of an agency s funds on a fiscal year basis  and the agencies  in turn  fund and award our projects 
agencies do not receive all funds for a given year at the outset of that year  rather they receive allocations and allotments in accordance with the office of management and budget guidelines and internal agency policies 
therefore  the anti deficiency act indirectly regulates how the agency awards our contracts and pays our invoices 
there are also numerous provisions within the far that affect the procurement process and administration of our contracts 
with respect to the conducting of a procurement  the far provides guidance on how the agency is to conduct the evaluation of an rfp 
the far also provides a mechanism through which disappointed bidders and contractors excluded from competing for government contracts and task or delivery orders may submit an objection  called a bid protest  to an agency contracting officer  the government accountability office in accordance with the relevant regulations  or the us court of federal claims 
performance under a contract being protested may be suspended while the protest is pending  and in cases where the contract is found to have been improperly awarded  the contract may be terminated  or other corrective action may be taken 
some contracts may be subject to the truth in negotiations act tina  cost accounting standards cas and contract cost principles and procedures cost principles 
generally  tina requires us to provide cost or pricing data and to certify that those data are current  accurate and complete  in connection with the negotiation of certain types of contracts  modifications or orders  but there are some exceptions to tina  including contracts that are based on adequate price competition 
the cas regulations specifically exempt small businesses from compliance with the accounting requirements 
as described under item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  we were previously categorized as a small business under federal procurement regulations  but now have grown sufficiently large that we no longer qualify as such 
as a result  cas will apply to our future contracts 
the cost principles set forth the rules regarding the allocability and allowability of costs incurred in connection with federal government contracts 
another area covered by the far is an organizational conflict of interest oci 
these regulations establish rules for avoiding  mitigating and neutralizing conflicts of interest in the issuance and performance of contracts by the federal government 
both contractors and contracting officers bear the burden of identifying and reporting ocis 
an oci may arise because the nature of the work to be 
table of contents performed by a contractor has the potential  absent some restriction on future activities  to result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor or impair the contractor s objectivity in performing the contract or providing assistance or advice to the federal government 
the government contracting officer is responsible for resolving any significant potential ocis before a contract award is made or as soon as the oci is identified 
our conduct and performance is also subject to the false claims act and other anti fraud statutes 
the false claims act  usc  prohibits contractors from knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for money eg  a false or fraudulent invoice to the federal government 
any claim of violation of the false claims act may be a criminal and or civil violation  which carries significant monetary penalties 
agencies may take administrative actions  such as suspension and debarment  in the event of a false claims act finding or conviction 
laws and regulations affecting international activities federal laws affect our ability to sell our products abroad and grant access to our technology to foreign nationals in the us we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domestically and abroad  governing certain aspects of our international sales and support  including regulations promulgated by  among others  the us departments of commerce  defense  state and justice and the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives 
for products and technology exported from the us or otherwise subject to us jurisdiction  we are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports  including  but not limited to the international traffic in arms regulations itar  the export administration regulations ear  the dod s fms program and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of the treasury 
we are also obligated to fulfill requirements under the us munitions import list for certain parts and components imported into the us for our products 
these laws and regulations impose compliance and licensing obligations to obtain us government authorization for transfers outside the us and to persons in the us other than us citizens and us permanent residents 
the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and equivalent laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
the fcpa has two principal parts anti bribery and record keeping provisions 
the us department of justice enforces the anti bribery provisions  the securities and exchange commission sec also has jurisdiction over civil enforcement of the anti bribery provisions 
the record keeping requirement  applicable only to companies registered on us stock exchanges  obligates companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal financial controls regarding all transactions 
the sec oversees enforcement of these provisions 
research and development we continually seek to improve our technological leadership position through internal research  product development  licensing  and acquisitions of complementary technologies 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development 
we continually work to enhance the survivability and reliability of our existing products and to develop and introduce innovative new products to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers domestically and internationally 
to supplement our research activities we purchased a blast and ballistics range which gives us a technological advantage enabling rapid prototyping  confirmation testing  and analysis 
in addition  we regularly investigate new ways to manufacture our various products to reduce variation  improve manufacturing cycle times  and reduce overall manufacturing costs 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  we spent million or of net sales  million or of net sales and million or of net sales  respectively  on research and development 
none of our research and development costs were funded by our customers 
we are committed to product development and expect to continue our investment in this area in the future 
we believe that the continual development or acquisition of innovative new products will be critical to our future success 
failure to develop  or introduce on a timely basis  new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for a discussion of the risk associated with product development 
raw material and supplies we depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw material and supplies 
the cost of our raw material and supplies may fluctuate substantially and some of our raw material and supplies may be in short supply  may be available from only one or a limited number of suppliers  or may only be available from foreign suppliers 
increased costs or difficulties in obtaining supplies and raw material in the requisite quantities  or at all  can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see item a  risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k for a discussion of our raw material 
we are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials  parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors 
the most important raw material required for our products are armored steel  milled steel  major automotive components  and ballistic glass 
several major automotive components are procured or subcontracted on a sole source  or limited source  basis with a number of domestic and non us companies 
the most important raw material purchased is steel  accounting for approximately of our total materials costs for the vehicles 
in the case of the buffalo  we are dependent on a non us supplier of armox and weldox steels 
the next generation buffalo  currently in testing with the us army  will incorporate domestic steel in place of foreign steel 
we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet our specifications  standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs 
while we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties  failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability  while jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers 
no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal 
various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods  including the timing of government awards  the availability of government funding  product deliveries and customer acceptance

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
please also see special note regarding forward looking statements on page 
table of contents if we are unable to obtain future orders for our vehicles  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would be adversely affected and our business may fail 
we have received substantial orders from the us military under the mrap program  which accounted for substantially all of the increase in our net sales during the year ended december  substantially all of our income comes from our us government contracts either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to another prime contractor to the us government 
these orders have resulted  in significant part  from the particular combat situations encountered by the us military in iraq and afghanistan  especially the use of ieds by enemy combatants 
we cannot be certain  therefore  to what degree the us military will continue placing orders  and these orders may decrease significantly or cease 
the main uncertainty about our future operations is whether we will continue to receive additional orders or contracts for our vehicles or our survivability solutions 
we estimate that orders for our mrap vehicles will allow us to continue production through the first part of and for our buffalo vehicles to extend production until it is impossible to predict with certainty whether such future orders or contracts will be placed by existing or new customers 
if we do not receive future orders or contracts for production beyond such dates  it is unlikely that our vehicle business will continue and our business will be materially affected 
our largest contract in  in terms of value  was awarded to us on a sole source basis in november by the us marine corps under the mrap program 
the mrap sole source contract was for our cougar and buffalo vehicles and was substantially performed in our largest contract in  in terms of value  was awarded to us in january by the us marine corps under the mrap program competitive bidding process 
the mrap competitive contract is an id iq contract that allows the us government to order a maximum of  cougar vehicles per year for a five year period 
however  the us government is not required to issue any vehicle orders under the mrap competitive contract  and existing orders can be terminated at the convenience of the government before completion 
we fulfill the mrap competitive contract with gdls through the gdls subcontract 
our largest contract in  in terms of value  was awarded to us by the united kingdom ministry of defence under the fms program 
the uk fms contract is for cougar mastiffs  a cougar x variant  six x cougars  and cougar ridgbacks  a cougar x variant 
the uk fms contract is administered by the marine corps systems command and is subject to price definitization 
moreover  we are seeking to sell our cheetah vehicle to the us military and our future results of operations will depend to a large degree on our ability to sell significant quantities of cheetah vehicles 
to the extent we are unable to sell a substantial quantity of cheetah vehicles  our results of operations will be materially adversely affected and we may suffer losses 
in addition  we have received contracts awards through the competitive bidding process  including the mrap competitive contract  and may continue to do so in the future 
the competitive bidding process presents a number of risks  including the following we may expend substantial funds  managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win  we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost that will be required to service any contract we win  which could result in substantial cost overruns  and we may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding  and any such protest or challenge could result in a requirement to resubmit bids on modified specifications or in the termination  reduction or modification of the awarded contract 

table of contents we rely on sales to the us government  and a failure to obtain new contracts or a reduction of sales under existing contracts with the us government could adversely affect our operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow to fund our operations 
the continuation and renewal of contracts with the us government are contingent upon the availability of governmental funding  which may be unpredictable 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts and subcontracts with the us government and its agencies  primarily the dod 
we expect that us government contracts  particularly with the dod  will continue to be our primary source of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the continuation and renewal of our existing government contracts and new government contracts are  among other things  contingent upon the availability of adequate funding for various us government agencies  including the dod 
changes in us government spending could directly affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
the loss or significant reduction in government funding of a large program in which we participate could also result in a material decrease to our future sales  earnings and cash flows 
us government contracts are also conditioned upon the continuing approval by congress of the amount of necessary spending 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a september fiscal year basis  even though contract periods of performance may extend over many years 
consequently  at the beginning of a major program  the contract is usually partially funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
among the factors that could impact us government spending and reduce our federal government contracting business include the outcome of the us november presidential and congressional elections  a significant decline in  or reapportioning of  spending by the us government  in general  or by the dod in particular post election  changes  delays or cancellations of us government programs  requirements or policies  the adoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies that provide services to the us government  us government shutdowns or other delays in the government appropriations process  curtailment of the us government s outsourcing of services to private contractors  changes in the political climate  including with regard to the funding or operation of the services we provide  and general economic conditions  including a slowdown in the economy or unstable economic conditions in the united states or in the countries in which we operate 
these or other factors could cause us government agencies to reduce their purchases under our contracts  to exercise their right to terminate our contracts in whole or in part  to issue temporary stop work orders  or decline to exercise options to renew  our contracts 
the loss or significant curtailment of our material government contracts  or our failure to renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts could adversely affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 

table of contents we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which have in the past and in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately or on a timely basis 
we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  as a result  current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
we identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting 
as a result in part of these material weaknesses  we also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  in addition  we previously identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that  as of december  and  we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting 
as a result in part of these material weaknesses  we also previously concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  and december  each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that we prepare will not be prevented or detected 
as a result  we must perform extensive additional work to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements 
even with this additional work  there is a risk of additional errors not being prevented or detected  which could result in additional restatements 
moreover  other material weaknesses may be identified 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves  we may be unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
any such failure in the future could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder and periodic management evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
if we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures  we could be subject to  among other things  regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec and nasdaq  including a delisting from the nasdaq capital market  securities litigation  and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our common stock 
we also have extensive work remaining to remedy the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and this work will continue during there can be no assurance as to when all of the material weaknesses will be remedied 
until our remedial efforts are completed  management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts  and we will continue to incur expenses associated with the additional procedures and resources required to prepare our financial statements and to remediate these weaknesses 
certain of our remedial actions  such as efforts to hire additional qualified personnel and implement new operating and accounting systems and new financial policies and procedures related thereto  will be ongoing and will result in our incurring substantial additional costs even after our material weaknesses are remedied 
in addition  there can be no assurance that  as a result of these remediation efforts or otherwise  we will not identify other inaccuracies in either our previous or future financial statements that will require amendments and restatements to those financial statements  which also could have a material adverse effect on us and on the price of our common stock 

table of contents although we have taken steps to correct our material weaknesses  we may still be subject to risks 
for a more detailed discussion of our material weaknesses  see item a  controls and procedures  in this annual report on form k 
we included restated condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this annual report on form k for the periods ended march   june  and september  and plan on promptly filing separate amended quarterly reports on form q to reflect the restated condensed consolidated financial statements for such periods 
continued amendments and restatements to our financial statements may result in potential and current shareholders losing confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
we included certain restated condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this annual report on form k for the periods ended march   june  and september  and plan on promptly filing separate amended quarterly reports on form qs for such periods to reflect such restated condensed consolidated financial statements 
we previously amended our consolidated financial statements and certain other financial information appearing in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and restated our consolidated financial statements and certain other financial information appearing in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  continued and repeated restatements and amendments to our consolidated financial statements and periodic reports may cause shareholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting  and such loss of confidence could cause the trading price of stock to become volatile or to decrease 
we are subject to and may continue to be subject to lawsuits resulting from the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our lack of sufficient management and managerial processes to support our rapid growth 
as described in the preceding risk factors and in more detail in item a  controls and procedures  we have announced that we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  we have not had robust internal systems in place for our managerial processes 
as a result  our rapid growth placed a great strain on the managerial and compliance processes in place at that time  that  along with the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  has subjected the company to increased risk of regulatory enforcement proceedings and private litigation 
we are aware that at least ten shareholder class action lawsuits have been initiated seeking damages to recompense those who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between august  and february  because of a loss in the trading value of our stock 
the allegations include but are not limited to allegations that certain former and current members of management and the board of directors violated the exchange act and made false or misleading public statements and or omissions concerning our business  internal controls  and financial results 
shareholders have filed at least seven derivative lawsuits against former and current officers and board members seeking damages and other relief  and we have been the subject of other suits  described in more detail in item  legal proceedings  stemming from weaknesses in our control over financial reporting and or from our managerial and compliance processes 
it is possible that other litigants may institute additional lawsuits against us as a result of these deficiencies seeking the payment of damages 
these lawsuits are likely to be costly to defend and could involve the substantial diversion of management time and resources and have other adverse effects  and we may be required to make substantial payments to settle any such lawsuits or to satisfy any judgments that may be rendered against us 

table of contents if we are unable to effectively manage the rate of change of our operations  our business and operating results will be harmed and our reputation may be damaged 
we significantly expanded our operations in  and in contrast  during the first six months of  we have focused on recalibrating the rate of our growth and expansion 
for example  our net sales grew from approximately million in to million in and to million for we have made substantial investment in our ladson manufacturing facility 
our ability to right size our business to match our operational requirements may have an impact as we have made substantial capital investments for our manufacturing capabilities at our leased ladson facility 
during the first six months of  we sought to stabilize our business to match our contract delivery order requirements 
we recognized that our business was changing  and in response  we are attempting to rebalance our workforce and manufacturing capacity 
we may incur costs as a result of our efforts to recalibrate our business to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  in the past three years we had sought to rapidly expand and develop our operations and production capacity 
we have incurred costs and are continuing to incur significant costs associated with our rapid expansion based on the expectation of future contract revenues 
we are still experiencing and may continue to experience certain effects from this rapid growth  such as payments under serverance arrangements and the cost associated with excess manufacturing capacity and inventory 
this growth had placed significant demands on our management and our administrative  operating  manufacturing and financial resources 
in addition  our operating and accounting systems and related financial policies and procedures need to be substantially improved in order to accommodate our current and projected production levels and to support our government compliance requirements now that we are classified as a large business under applicable federal contracting regulations 
we continue to face challenges in improving our administrative  operating  managerial  accounting and financial systems to accommodate our current and projected production levels 
even though the rate of our growth has decreased  the transition may continue to place a significant strain on our resources 
our future performance and results of operations will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees  management and other key personnel  our ability to implement successful increases to our production capacity and enhancements to our management  accounting and information technology systems  and our ability to adapt our facilities and systems  as necessary  to respond to growth and changes in our business 
we recently added significant manufacturing capacity and currently have excess manufacturing capacity 
if demand for our vehicles declines  we may have additional inefficient or under utilized capacity  and our gross margins and cash flows may suffer and we may incur losses 
in response to the increased demand for our blast and ballistic protected vehicles  we added significant manufacturing capacity during each of the past several years 
currently  we have excess manufacturing capacity 
in addition  demand for our vehicles may not remain at levels sufficient to utilize our present manufacturing capacity 
much of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment are special purpose in nature and cannot be adapted easily to make other products 
if the demand for mine protected vehicles does not increase or declines substantially from current levels  our facilities may have significant under utilized capacity 
therefore  a substantial decline in demand for our blast and ballistic protected vehicles could result in significant additional excess manufacturing capacity  which would adversely affect our results of operations and could result in losses 
for example  we purchased and made substantial expenditures at our roxboro  north carolina facility to manufacture the cheetah vehicle 
we have not yet begun to manufacture the cheetah vehicle in commercial quantities 
as of june   we had manufactured a limited number of cheetah vehicles  all of which have been used solely for testing and demonstration purposes 
we have not 
table of contents received any orders for the cheetah to date 
in march  we had an impairment of our assets in connection with our decision to suspend the construction of the assembly line at our roxboro  north carolina facility and development of a plan for an alternative use for the facility 
see item note  property and equipment subsequent event asset impairment 
we currently intend to use our roxboro  north carolina facility for training and sustainment purposes 
our business may be materially affected if we are unable to anticipate the demand for and develop acceptable next generation vehicles and other survivability solutions to meet the demands of our customers  or if we are unable to sell next generation vehicles in the quantities that we anticipate 
the future of our business depends on our ability to anticipate threats to the survivability of friendly forces and to develop  test  and be able to produce solutions to counter these threats in a manner that satisfies the cost  performance  and schedule demands of our customers 
to the extent that our customers seek additional survivability solutions  we expect to face substantial competition from other companies  many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do  in competing for these orders 
accordingly  if we are unable to develop and design acceptable vehicles and solutions in time to meet the demands of our customers  our net sales may decline in the future 
additionally  if we are unable to sell the next generation of vehicles in the quantities that we anticipate  our inventory and prior capital investments may not be fully utilized and our business may be materially affected 
for example  we have not yet begun to manufacture the cheetah vehicle in commercial quantities 
as of june   we had manufactured a limited number of cheetah vehicles  all of which have been used solely for testing and demonstration purposes 
this means that we have incurred expenses for components  raw material  and other expenses in connection with producing the cheetah without any orders from customers to purchase the vehicles we manufacture 
moreover  we may experience difficulties  expenses and delays in starting up production at this new facility  as we have no prior experience in manufacturing the cheetah vehicle in commercial quantities and it may take a substantial period of time for us and our employees to develop sufficient familiarity with this new facility in order for us to achieve requisite efficiencies in producing the cheetah 
to the extent that we do not receive orders for the cheetah in significant quantities  or if those orders are received later than we anticipate  or if we incur delays or unforeseen expenses in connection with outfitting and equipping this facility  our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
if these events occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  if we are not able to sell the cheetah in significant quantities or at all  we may not be able to sustain the growth of our business  our net sales may decline and our business may be materially adversely affected 
we are now a large business under applicable us government regulations and may be precluded from being awarded new contracts with the us government unless our accounting and estimating systems are improved sufficiently to meet government standards 
in order to enter into certain contracts with the us military  a contractor s accounting and estimating systems must generally meet the standards established by the far  and  with regard to certain types of contracts  cas 
compliance is usually reviewed by the dcaa  an arm of the dod 
contractors who do not meet these standards generally are not eligible to win certain new contracts from the us government 

table of contents because we previously were a small business within the meaning of applicable federal regulations  we were not required to comply with the accounting and estimating requirements in order to enter into contracts with the us military 
however  as a result of the growth of our business  as of november   we are no longer considered a small business and we therefore will be required to meet these additional accounting and estimating standards to the extent that they apply to new contracts that we are awarded 
we have been advised by the dcaa that our accounting and estimating systems do not meet these requirements and  although we have been seeking to improve these systems  we have extensive work remaining in order to meet these standards 
there can be no assurance as to when we will be able to meet these standards and  until we are able to do so  we may not be eligible for new contract awards by the us military 
accordingly  any failure to meet these standards will likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
in that regard  we have recently implemented a new accounting system and there is some uncertainty as to whether this system will be capable of generating the data necessary to comply with these standards 
if our new accounting system is inadequate for these purposes  we could incur substantial delays and additional expenses through efforts to remedy those deficiencies or acquire and implement a new accounting system 
moreover  cas differs from generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  which means that we will be required to maintain accounting records in sufficient detail to comply with both cas and gaap 
given the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other deficiencies in our accounting system described below under item a  controls and procedures  the requirement to comply with cas will be a considerable challenge and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in complying with cas 
the cas are designed to achieve uniformity and consistency in the measurement  assignment  and allocation of costs to us government contracts 
cas covered contractors must complete a disclosure statement  which is a written description of the contractor s cost accounting practices and procedures 
the purpose of the disclosure statement is to determine whether the contractor s cost accounting practices and procedures are consistently applied and whether they comply with cas provisions 
if the contractor fails to comply with cas provisions  the us government may withhold up to ten percent of each payment due until the necessary corrections are made 
if a contractor fails to provide accurate information  under certain circumstances  the us government can make unilateral adjustments 
additionally  dcaa may require more frequent updates if audits reveal non compliant cas submissions and accounting 
we submitted a cas disclosure statement to dcaa on may  with an effective date of june  to the extent that cas requirements apply to future contracts awarded to us  we will be required to satisfy more difficult us government accounting requirements than have previously applied  and a failure by us to comply with these new requirements may have consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations  we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions 
we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government contracts 
in complying with these laws and regulations  we may incur additional costs  and non compliance may also allow for the assignment of additional fines and penalties  including contractual damages 
among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are the following the federal acquisition regulation  which comprehensively regulates the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  
table of contents the cost accounting standards and cost principles  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based federal government contracts  and laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services and technical data 
we engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of us export control laws 
failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties  both civil and criminal  and can include debarment from contracting with the us government 
our contracting agency customers periodically review our performance under and compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts 
if a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  cost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies 
additionally  the civil false claims act provides for potentially substantial civil penalties where  for example  a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval 
actions under the civil false claims act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government who may then share a portion of any recovery 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may also suffer harm to our reputation  which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts 
if we are subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation  our current business  future prospects  financial condition  or operating results could be materially harmed 
the government may also revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations  including cost accounting standards  at any time 
any new contracting methods could be costly to satisfy  be administratively difficult for us to implement and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
the dcaa has issued audit reports that have been highly critical of our accounting and price estimating systems  and have questioned our ability to track and report our government contract costs appropriately 
as a result  the dcaa could question or disallow our proposed costs under some of our government contracts  and our profits may be adversely affected 
in addition  other governmental agencies may audit or issue reports about the status of our contracts 
us government agencies  generally through the dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
the audits may review the costs we incur on our us government contracts  including allocated indirect costs 
the auditor may also review our compliance with applicable laws  government regulations  policies and standards and the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies 
an adverse finding under a dcaa audit could result in the disallowance of our costs under a us government contract  termination of us government contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
if any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative 
table of contents sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  responding to governmental audits may involve significant expense and divert management attention 
moreover  if any of our administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with the applicable requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny or required to obtain additional governmental approvals that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
therefore  an unfavorable outcome to an audit by the dcaa or another government agency  could materially adversely affect our competitive position and result in a substantial reduction of our revenues 
the dcaa issued at least eight audit reports on our operations and contracts from may of through october of  in addition  the us army tank automotive and armaments command audited our quality system of control in early  and the inspector general of the dod issued a report in june questioning the award of sole source contracts to us and criticizing our performance under them 
these reports have generally been highly critical of the areas covered by the audits  including our job cost accounting and price estimating systems  the timeliness of the delivery of vehicles  and our financial condition 
the dcaa has issued two reports  one on january  stating that our estimating system is inadequate and another on march  stating that there was insufficient data due to a lack of financial reports to perform financial statement and ratio analysis 
as a result  the dcaa could question or disallow our proposed costs under some of our government contracts  and our profits may be adversely affected 
in addition  other governmental agencies may audit or issue reports about the status of our contracts 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by the definitization of our contracts if we are unable to reserve adequately for payments on these contracts and if we do not maintain accounting systems effective enough to capture all costs incurred under these contracts 
many of the contracts we have previously received from the us military have been sole source and or not to exceed contracts 
both types of contracts are subject to definitization  meaning that the contract price is not agreed upon at contract inception 
instead  following award of the contract  we and the us government seek to agree upon a contract price based upon our cost of performing the contract 
during the definitization process  we are required to perform the contract work  make deliveries and receive payments from the us military before the final contract price has been established 
for this reason  as part of the original award  we provide a not to exceed nte  price to be used for invoicing and accounting purposes pending definitization 
as a result  at the completion of the contract  we may have received overpayments during the course of the contract and will be required to return any overpayments to the us military 
as result of the potential adjustments related to the definitization process  we maintain a separate account for payments received for contracts that may be subject to definitization 
the definitization process can be time consuming and can take months or even years to complete 
although we work diligently with our customers to proceed with significant work when we have a fully definitized task order  we cannot assure you that there will not be withholdings on future task orders 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the actual prices we receive under contracts subject to definitization will not be substantially less than our estimates  which would adversely affect our operating results and could result in losses 
at the end of  we had definitized all outstanding contracts 
however  in we have been awarded eight delivery orders that are still subject to the definitization process 

table of contents we rely on subcontractors to manufacture or perform some of the assembly of our vehicles and the loss of any critical subcontractors could delay our manufacturing operations  which could affect our ability to meet our contract delivery requirements to our customers  in addition subcontractors may attempt to increase the amounts they charge us  adversely affecting our operating results 
some of the major work processes performed in our vehicle manufacturing are done by subcontractors 
for example  a portion of the capsules of our cougars are shipped to spartan chassis  inc spartan in charlotte  michigan  which supplies and installs the engine  transmission  transfer case  drive shafts  differentials  axle assemblies  tires  fuel tank  steering  and associated mechanical and electrical hardware 
additionally  under our gdls subcontract  gdls and spartan as a subcontractor to gdls perform the final assembly of a portion of these vehicles windows  doors  external appurtenances  hatches  seats  fenders  lights  paint  and other final assembly hardware 
if these  or any other critical subcontractor  cease doing business with us whether voluntarily or due to other events  we would be required to locate a substitute subcontractor or perform the work ourselves 
further  any inability of these subcontractors to perform these services in a timely manner may result in a delay in deliveries to our customers 
the amounts we pay to some of these subcontractors represent a very significant portion of the overall costs of our cougar vehicles 
however  certain of our subcontractors have not entered into subcontracts with us to provide these services  although in some cases we do have purchase orders covering basic terms such as price or quantities but other terms and conditions have yet to be agreed upon 
this means that we may have issues regarding some terms and conditions  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
we may require additional capital to provide for our working capital needs 
we may require substantial additional capital to provide for our working capital and other cash needs 
we currently anticipate that we may be required to obtain additional capital in and  to the extent that our cash needs are greater than we anticipate  we may require additional capital before that time 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  contained elsewhere herein 
we may seek to obtain this additional capital through  among other things  borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
any inability to obtain additional capital as and when required could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and results of operations 
we currently have a million credit facility that expires on october  that provides us with the ability to obtain capital if cash available from other sources is insufficient to meet our needs 
in the event that we are not able to renew this credit facility or obtain another credit facility  we will not have the ability to make revolving credit borrowings to finance our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
to date  we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility 
borrowings under our existing credit facility bear interest at variable rates  and borrowings we incur in the future may also bear interest at variable rates  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates 
in addition  our existing credit facility is secured by an interest in all of our personal property and fixtures  and any debt instruments we enter into in the future may also be secured by our assets  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional debt financing 
our us government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and may be terminated or adversely modified prior to completion  which could adversely affect our business 
congress funds the vast majority of the federal budget on an annual basis  and congress often does not provide agencies with all the money requested in their budget 
many of our contracts cover 
table of contents multiple years and  as such  are not fully funded at contract award 
if congress or one of our agency customers chooses to spend money on other programs  our contracts may be terminated for convenience 
federal laws  collectively called the anti deficiency act  prohibit involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose  unless otherwise allowed by law 
therefore  the anti deficiency act indirectly regulates how the agency awards our contracts and pays our invoices 
federal government contracts generally contain provisions  and are subject to laws and regulations  that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including provisions permitting the federal government to  among other provisions terminate our existing contracts  modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts  subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors  suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders  and claim rights in technologies and systems invented  developed or produced by us 
the federal government may terminate a contract with us either for convenience for instance  due to a change in its perceived needs or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a workshare partner or subcontractor to perform under the contract 
if the federal government terminates a contract with us for convenience  we generally would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
however  under certain circumstances  our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited 
if the federal government terminates a contract with us based upon our default  we generally would be denied any recovery for undelivered work  and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the federal government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source 
as is common with government contractors  we have experienced and continue to experience occasional performance issues under some of our contracts 
we have in the past received and may in the future receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that  if not addressed to the federal government s satisfaction  could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts 
in addition  us government contracts and subcontracts typically involve long purchase and payment cycles  competitive bidding  qualification requirements  delays or changes in funding  extensive specification development  price negotiations and milestone requirements 
each us government agency often also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies 
our backlog is subject to uncertainties  and we may not sell or receive payment for all of the vehicles we have included in backlog  which would reduce our revenue in future periods 
our backlog reflects the number of vehicles for which we have received orders as of the measurement date 
our backlog includes vehicles to be manufactured by gdls pursuant to the terms of our gdls subcontract described in item i  business and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  contained elsewhere herein 
our backlog is subject to uncertainties  and there can be no assurance that we will deliver or receive payment for the vehicles we have included in our backlog 
as a result  there is no certainty about our future revenues because the timing of any of these vehicles sales and revenues is subject to various contingencies  such as production difficulties  raw material shortages and quality acceptance 
if we fail to sell vehicles included in our backlog  our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we must comply with numerous miscellaneous federal national security laws  regulations  and procedures  and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business 
we must observe laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of federal government contracts that affect how we do business with our clients and impose added costs on our business 
for example  the far and the industrial security regulations of the dod and related laws include provisions that allow our federal government clients to terminate or not renew our contracts if we come under foreign ownership  control or influence  require us to prevent unauthorized access to classified information  and require us to comply with laws and regulations intended to promote various social or economic goals 
we are subject to industrial security regulations of the dod and other federal agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners access to classified information 
if we were to come under foreign ownership  control or influence  we could lose our facility security clearances  which could result in our federal government customers terminating or deciding not to renew our contracts  and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts 
our failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations or procedures  including federal regulations regarding the protection of classified information  could result in contract termination  loss of security clearances  suspension or prohibition from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which could materially adversely affect our business 
most of our contracts are on a fixed price basis  which could subject us to losses if there are cost overruns 
under a fixed price contract  we receive only the amount indicated in the contract  regardless of the actual cost to produce the goods 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from potential cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
if the initial estimates that we use to calculate the contract price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect  we could incur losses 
this risk is enhanced because of the deficiencies in our accounting systems described above 
in addition  some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost  scheduling  and performance 
if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts  then our cost to perform the work could increase or our price could be reduced  which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we may incur losses on fixed price contracts that we had expected to be profitable  or such contracts may be less profitable than expected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we are presently subject to a number of legal proceedings and claims and we may become subject to additional legal proceedings and claims in the future 
we have been named in several purported class actions brought by shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between and  alleging violations of the exchange act  and making false and misleading public statements and or omissions 
other shareholders have named us and certain current and former officers and directors in derivative suits alleging breaches of fiduciary duties 
we have also been subject to a variety of other lawsuits  including claims involving the use of our confidential information and trade secrets  contractual claims  claims related to our common shares  osha claims and claims by the department of state  directorate of defense trade controls ddtc 
litigation and regulatory inquiries of these types are often expensive and time consuming and their outcome is uncertain 

table of contents such claims and regulatory inquiries  whether successful or not  could require us to devote significant amounts of monetary or human resources to defend ourselves and could harm our reputation 
we may need to spend significant amounts on our legal defense  senior management may be required to divert their attention from other portions of our business  new product launches may be deferred or canceled as a result of any proceedings  and we may be required to make changes to our present and planned products or services 
if  as a result of any proceedings  a settlement is reached  a judgment is rendered or a decree is entered against us  it could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation 
we are also a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business 
we may be involved from time to time in other litigation that could have a material effect on our operations or finances 
other than the litigation described above  we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
see item  legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form k 
we are currently under directives to improve our compliance policies and procedures concerning activity regulated by the international traffic in arms regulations itar 
in early november  the ddtc advised us of a site visit planned for december in advance of that site visit  the ddtc requested  and we provided  certain documents and materials relating to our policies and procedures concerning company activity regulated by the itar 
the site visit took place in mid december and included a meeting with certain of our officers and interviews of certain of our employees involved with security  training  business development  human resources  information technology  empowered officials  engineering  contracts  manufacturing  program management  shipping  supply chain integrated logistics support and quality 
following the site visit  we received a letter from the ddtc regarding certain weaknesses it identified in our compliance program with respect to training  treatment of foreign visitors  overseas travel by personnel  export manuals  identifying data regarding itar hardware and services  and license tracking and requesting certain specific measures be undertaken 
although  we cannot assure you we are in the process of addressing those specific measures 
in early december  we submitted a voluntary disclosure to the ddtc regarding the shipment of technical manuals  cheetah spare parts  armored vest plates  parts not listed on our license and transfers of technical data to and by our vendors without proper authorization or identification of the appropriate exemption 
the ddtc responded in mid january and requested additional information and documentation for each specific shipment of these items within sixty days 
in addition  the ddtc directed us to undertake certain specific measures  including  but not limited to  that we hire a full time senior export control compliance officer  implement certain procedures  conduct comprehensive itar training  immediately conduct a comprehensive export compliance audit  and institute a plan to conduct periodic audits of the export compliance program 
although  we cannot assure you we are in the process of addressing these directives 
as a result of the export compliance audit  we have identified additional unauthorized transfers internally at our facility and in support of us operations in iraq and afghanistan as well as issues associated with the execution of our licenses and agreements 
we have reported these matters to ddtc 
compliance with the directives of the ddtc may result in substantial expenses and diversion of management 
any failure to adequately address the directives of ddtc could result civil fines and or suspension or loss of our export privileges  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents our products are subject to export limitations and we may be prevented from shipping our products to certain nations or buyers 
we are subject to federal licensing requirements with respect to the sale and support in foreign countries of certain of our products and the importation of components for our products 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domestically and abroad  governing certain aspects of our international sales and support  including regulations promulgated by  among others  the us departments of commerce  defense and state and the us department of justice  bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives 
such licenses may be denied for reasons of us national security or foreign policy 
in the case of certain large orders for exports of defense equipment  the department of state must notify congress at least to days  depending on the size and location of the sale  prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments 
during that time  congress may take action to block the proposed sale 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that congress will not prevent or delay certain sales 
any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the us could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
for products and technology exported from the us or otherwise subject to us jurisdiction  we are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports  including  but not limited to itar  ear  or fms  program and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by ofac  us department of the treasury 
we have discovered shortcomings in our export compliance procedures 
we are currently analyzing product shipments and technology transfers  working with us government officials to ensure compliance with applicable us export laws and regulations  and enhancing our export compliance system 
we have made voluntary disclosures to the department of state and provided additional documentation to the us department of state regarding compliance issues 
the state department personnel visited our facilities in december as part of the state department company visit program for a further review of our export control policies and procedures  as well as their implementation 
the voluntary disclosures that have been finally adjudicated by the us department of state did not result in any monetary fines or restrictions on exports 
the us department of state recommended enhancements to our compliance program  some of which we have implemented and others which we are implementing 
two voluntary disclosures remain outstanding 
the state department is now treating one of these matters as a directed disclosure  a more serious category of disclosures 
the state department has asked to review additional information and we have provided the state department with all of the requested information 
we are currently reviewing additional compliance information and will file voluntary disclosures if warranted 
a determination by the us government that we have failed to comply with one or more of these export controls or trade sanctions  as a consequence of the results of the directed disclosure or any other violations that may be determined  could result in civil or criminal penalties  including the imposition of significant fines  denial of export privileges  loss of revenues from certain customers  and debarment from participation in us government contracts 
any one or more of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to the fcpa and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
we operate in countries known to experience corruption 
our operations in such countries create the risk of an unauthorized payment by one of our employees or agents which would be in violation of various laws including the fcpa 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in that regard  we do not have a formal fcpa compliance program 

table of contents additionally  the failure to obtain applicable governmental approval and clearances could materially adversely affect our ability to continue to service the government contracts we maintain 
exports of some of our products to certain international destinations may require shipment authorization from us export control authorities  including the us departments of commerce and state  and authorizations may be conditioned on end use restrictions 
failure to receive these authorizations may materially adversely affect our revenues and in turn our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our international business may pose greater risks than our domestic business due to the greater potential for changes in foreign economic and political environments 
our international business is also highly sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets 
sales of military products are affected by defense budgets both in the us and abroad and us foreign policy 
sales of our products and services internationally are subject to us and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import export control 
we may experience supply interruptions for certain components used in the manufacture and sustainment of our products  which could cause delays in production  product deliveries and the sustainment of our vehicles 
in the event that we are unable to obtain required components from our existing suppliers  and if we are unable to mitigate the impact or find an alternate supplier in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our vehicles and provide sustainment 
significant interruptions in the supply of components may occur for a variety of reasons  including capacity constraints at our suppliers  competition for components with other manufacturers of vehicles  insolvency of a supplier  work stoppages at suppliers and transportation interruptions  which could involve significant additional costs and result in delays in production  product deliveries and sustainment and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the unavailability or scarcity of certain components or raw material could result in increased costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights and trade secrets from unauthorized use  and we may become subject to claims that we infringe on others intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and other intellectual property laws  licensing agreements  nondisclosure agreements with employees and customers and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights to our products and production processes 
our pending patent applications may not be granted by the various patent offices examining them 
even if our patent applications are granted and issued as patents  these measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or processes similar or superior to ours 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights  these efforts may not be successful 
from time to time  we may litigate within the united states or abroad to enforce our issued or licensed patents  to protect our trade secrets and know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others 
for example  we are currently involved in a lawsuit in which we allege misappropriation of our intellectual property 
see item  legal proceedings 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights could be expensive  requires management s attention and might not bring us timely or effective relief 

table of contents we are party to two long term intellectual property agreements pursuant to which we have the exclusive right to use certain intellectual property technology relating to blast and ballistic protected vehicles through and  respectively 
see item  business intellectual property for a further discussion of these agreements with csir and mechem 
in the event that the license agreements expire without renewal  csir and mechem may permit other parties to use the licensed technology  including our competitors 
the loss of these intellectual property rights may adversely affect our operations 
furthermore  third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
infringement claims against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if we ultimately prevail 
a third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we were to lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to recruit qualified managers and key personnel in the future 
moreover  a number of our officers and other key employees have joined our company recently  and therefore have only limited experience with our business 
our success depends on the continued service of our management team and key personnel 
if one or more of these individuals were unable to continue working due to health reasons  or were to resign or otherwise terminate their employment with us  we could experience a loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources  and we may have difficulty replacing any of these individuals 
we do not have key person insurance on any of our executive employees 
competition for qualified managers and key personnel is intense and we may not be able to recruit and retain such personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing managers and employees or hire and integrate new personnel  we may experience operating inefficiencies  production delays and reduced profitability or losses 
in addition  a number of our officers and key employees have joined our company recently  and therefore have limited experience with our business  personnel  and administrative systems 
for example  our executive vice president of finance joined our company in july  our interim chief financial officer joined in february  our chief strategy officer and general counsel joined in november  and our president was appointed in september and appointed as chief executive officer in january the ability of new management to articulate and implement their strategic vision  and to integrate effectively into the company s business  personnel  and administrative systems  is critical to our success 
we have lacked robust managerial processes  which must be upgraded to make a successful transition to a mature business 
in the past  we did not have robust internal systems in place for our managerial processes 
as a result  our rapid growth placed a great strain on the managerial and compliance processes in place at that time  and has subjected the company to increased risk of regulatory enforcement proceedings and private litigation 
we have developed and started to implement new business and compliance plans that seek to address these issues and to transition our company into a mature operating business 
however  we cannot provide you with any assurances that we will be able to implement these new processes and successfully make that transition

each series shall consist of such number of shares and have the rights  preferences  powers and restrictions  such as dividend rights and preferences  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption and liquidation rights and preferences  as our board of directors shall determine 
such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock with voting  conversion or other rights that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company and that could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market and transferred to the national quotation service bureau pink sheets  which may  among other things  reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
as a result of our inability to timely file our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended march  and june   we received nasdaq staff determination notices stating that our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
we appealed the determination with the nasdaq listing qualification panel and received a stay from delisting until september  in order to file such annual and quarterly reports and any required restatements with the sec 
we subsequently requested an extension from the nasdaq listing qualification panel to file our quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended march  and june  on or before september  although we have now filed our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ended december  which includes restated condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information for the periods ended march   june  and september  and plan on promptly filing amended and restated quarterly reports on form q for such periods to reflect the condensed consolidated financial statements  we have not yet filed our quarterly reports on forms q for the periods ended march  and june  and we have not yet received formal notification from nasdaq that our request for an extension to file such quarterly reports has been granted or that our common stock will continued to be listed on the nasdaq capital market pending those filings 
our stock price has been volatile  and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline

for example  in the last quarter of fiscal year  the price of our common stock ranged from to 
the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
factors affecting our market price include  but are not limited to  our failure to meet expectations regarding new orders or sales of our vehicles  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts or orders by us or our competitors  and market reaction to any future acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors 
recent events have caused stock prices for many companies  including ours  to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance 
the general economic  political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following 
table of contents periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
any such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as nevada corporation law  could make it difficult for our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as discussed above  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval 
any issuance of this blank check preferred stock could materially limit the rights of holders of the common stock and render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and by laws contain a number of provisions that could impede a takeover or change in control of us  including our staggered board  limitation on the ability of our shareholders to act by written consent  advance notice provisions and the ability for the board of directors to fill a vacancy on our board of directors 
certain provisions of the nevada revised statutes law could also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors or shareholders 
these provisions relate to  among other things  the acquisition of a controlling interest in a nevada corporation meeting certain requirements or certain business combinations and other transactions between a nevada corporation and certain interested stockholders

highlights and executive summary we are an important provider of blast and ballistic protected products used to support armed forces and security personnel in harm s way 
we design  manufacture  test  deliver and support our blast and ballistic protected products with the purpose to increase survivability of the users of the 
table of contents products 
our specialty vehicles  which we believe are at the forefront of blast and ballistic protected technology  are designed to protect their occupants from landmines  hostile fire  and improvised explosive devices ieds 
we are an important provider of vehicles for the us military s mine resistant ambush protected mrap vehicle program  which is currently one of the highest priority acquisition programs for the us department of defense dod  according to a memorandum from secretary of defense robert gates dated may  through an acquisition in  we began shifting our principal focus from our then existing recreational watercraft production business to the production of mine clearing and armored vehicles 
our business began to grow exponentially when we were awarded contracts by the us military in and each year after that 
by  substantially all of our net sales were derived from work performed directly or indirectly under us government contracts 
for the years ended december   and  our net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively  and our net income loss totaled million  million and million  respectively 
overview we design  manufacture  test  deliver and support our blast and ballistic protected products to increase survivability of the users of the products 
these vehicles require ongoing life cycle support in the areas of spare parts  maintenance  and training 
as a consequence  we believe that we have a substantial business opportunity to provide life cycle support to our existing and future fleet of vehicles 
in addition  as the fleet ages  we have the opportunity to offer upgrades and product improvements for our fleet designed to further enhance the operability and capability of the vehicles 
our specialty vehicles  which we believe are at the forefront of blast and ballistic protected technology  are designed to protect their occupants from landmines  hostile fire and ieds 
we currently have three vehicle types aimed at fulfilling different operational or mission requirements the buffalo  the cougar and the cheetah 
the buffalo has six wheels  is our largest vehicle and is designed primarily for use in conducting mine clearance operations 
the cougar is a medium sized vehicle and is available in wheeled and wheeled variants and in a variety of configurations for troop transport  command and control  route reconnaissance  convoy escort and ambulance duty 
the cheetah has four wheels and is designed specifically for reconnaissance  forward command and control and urban operations 
at present  we have not sold any cheetah vehicles 
we are headquartered  and have manufacturing facilities  in ladson  south carolina 
in march  we purchased a blast range in edgefield  south carolina  and leased a related office building 
we use these facilities for our own research and development activities and may also contract with selected governmental and commercial customers to use our facilities 
we also purchased  in march  a facility in summerville  south carolina  for the intended purpose of expanding research and development operations and to facilitate our increased customer training requirements of products and applications 
in july  we purchased an additional facility in roxboro  north carolina 
we intend to use this facility for training and sustainment purposes 
in january  we leased a small furnished office space in sterling heights  michigan  for use as an offsite engineering office 
our business business model and key concepts our business is heavily influenced by the needs of the us military for blast and ballistic protected wheeled vehicles 
the dod is our largest customer 
for the past several years  substantially all of our net sales were derived from the us government 
to meet the requirements of the mrap competitive contract  on september  we entered into a subcontract gdls subcontract with general dynamics land systems inc gdls pursuant to which gdls manufactures approximately of the cougar vehicles to be manufactured under  and performs approximately 
table of contents of the life cycle support required by  the mrap competitive contract based on revenues 
we previously entered into a joint venture with gdls on december  workshare agreement pursuant to which we and gdls would fulfill the obligations of the mrap competitive contract 
we formed a delaware limited liability company  force dynamics  llc force dynamics  to govern the terms of the joint venture 
however  the mrap competitive contract was awarded to us and not to force dynamics or gdls 
we have attempted to novate this contract to force dynamics  although the us government has not yet agreed to the novation 
if the contract is novated  we and gdls may be required to guarantee payment of all liabilities and performance of all obligations that force dynamics will assume under the novated contract 
because this contract was awarded to force protection and has not yet been novated to the joint venture  we include of the revenues from the mrap competitive contract including revenue from vehicles manufactured by gdls in net sales in our consolidated statement of operations  and will continue to include them until such time as the mrap competitive contract is novated to force dynamics  at which point we will recognize revenues only from vehicles subcontracted by force dynamics that we actually manufacture 
in addition  during the year ended december  we include in cost of sales  an amount equal to of revenues from vehicles manufactured by gdls 
notwithstanding the inclusion of revenues from vehicles manufactured by gdls in net sales  gdls is entitled to all of the revenue from vehicles manufactured by gdls 
activities under the gdls subcontract continue to evolve and after certain activities performed by gdls result in a gross profit to us 
to meet the needs of other government contracts  in we significantly expanded our work force and invested heavily in additional production facility capacity 
however  beginning at the end of the first quarter of  we began to scale back our work force to be more in line with current demand 
in the future  we intend to utilize partners and subcontractors to further expand our capacity and capability to fulfill government contracts 
this is especially key as us government contracts permit the government to terminate the contract  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience or for default  usually based on performance 
therefore  if the federal government terminates a contract with us or if we default due to our failure or the failure of our partner to perform under the contract  we would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to the termination at best or could even be liable for excess costs incurred by the federal government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source 
key challenges our rapid growth has come with numerous challenges 
coupled with our reliance on the us military for substantially all of our business  we have identified the following key challenges to continued success being awarded additional orders or contracts for our vehicles in a volatile marketplace  driving a business in an environment where us military contracts  which represent substantially all of our business  may be terminated in whole or in part at any time  and remediating internal control weaknesses over financial reporting and disclosure 
as discussed in item a  risk factors  the main uncertainty about our future operations is whether we will continue to receive additional orders or contracts for our vehicles 
we estimate that orders for mrap vehicles allow us to continue production through the first part of and for our buffalo vehicles to extend production until it is impossible to predict with certainty whether future orders or contracts will be placed by new or existing customers for our existing products 
if we do not receive 
table of contents future orders or contracts for production beyond such dates  it is unlikely that our vehicle business will continue and our business will be materially affected 
as discussed in item a  risk factors  we derive substantially all of our revenue from contracts and subcontracts with the us government and its agencies  primarily the dod 
we expect that us government contracts  particularly with the dod  will continue to be our primary source of revenue for the foreseeable future 
the continuation and renewal of our existing government contracts and new government contracts are  among other things  contingent upon the availability of adequate funding for various us government agencies  including the dod 
changes in us government spending could directly affect our operating performance and lead to an unexpected loss of revenue 
the loss or significant reduction in government funding of a large program in which we participate could also result in a material decrease to our future sales  earnings and cash flows 
as discussed in item a  risk factors  we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective as of december   and although we have taken steps to correct our material weaknesses  we may still be subject to risks 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves  we may be unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
there can be no assurance that  as a result of these remediation efforts or otherwise  we will not identify other inaccuracies in either our previous or future financial statements that will require amendments and restatements to those financial statements  which could have a material adverse effect on us and the price of our common stock 
we experienced substantial growth in net sales during and as a result  our general and administrative expenses and certain other expenses increased substantially as well 
we expect that general and administrative expenses and certain other expenses will continue to increase 
however  we are unable to predict whether general and administrative expenses  cost of sales and other expenses  expressed as a percentage of our net sales  will increase or decrease 
during the first six months of  we sought to stabilize our business to match our contract delivery order requirements 
we recognized that our business was changing  and in response  we are attempting to rebalance our workforce and manufacturing capacity 
we may incur costs as a result of our efforts to recalibrate our business to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  in the past three years we had sought to rapidly expand and develop our operations and production capacity 
we have incurred costs and are continuing to incur significant costs associated with our rapid expansion based on the expectation of future contract revenues 
we are still experiencing and may continue to experience certain effects from this rapid growth  such as payments under severance arrangements and the costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity and inventory 
this growth had placed significant demands on our management and our administrative  operating  manufacturing and financial resources 
in addition  our accounting and financial systems need to be substantially improved in order to accommodate our current and projected production levels and to support our government compliance requirements now that we are classified as a large business under applicable federal contracting regulations 
we continue to face challenges in improving our administrative  operating  managerial  accounting and financial systems to accommodate our current and projected production levels 

table of contents strategy and key trends strategy we plan to leverage our investments in product development and production facilities 
to accomplish this we will identify new products and markets to meet evolving customer requirements  capitalize on demand for blast and ballistic protected vehicles and other survivability solutions  expand our service and support network  focus on core competencies  and leverage key relationships to grow our business 
key trends for periods subsequent to  certain factors are expected to affect our results of operations as compared to results reported herein for through some of these factors are stabilizing our growth and expansion to match our contract delivery order requirements  the gdls subcontract  under which during we purchased vehicles produced by gdls from gdls at the same sales price at which we sold the vehicles to the us military  resulting in a zero gross profit for such sales  and under which after certain activities performed by gdls will result in a gross profit to us  additional partnering to increase our offerings in designing survivability solutions  gaining insight into customer needs and shifting away from manufacturing  costs of the roxboro  north carolina facility purchased in initially intended to be used to expand our manufacturing capacity that in the first quarter of was determined to be excess capacity and for which we began to develop a plan for alternative use for the facility and for which we incurred an impairment charge of million  and potential additional business activities and full year carrying costs related to purchase of blast range and lease of a facility primarily for research and development activities and customer training 
results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated statements of operations  which reflect our results of operations for the years ended december   and  as prepared in accordance with gaap

the vehicles sold under such contracts  which started shipping in the first quarter of  represent approximately of the vehicles sold in net sales the increase in net sales for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  is attributable to an increase in volume of vehicle deliveries  spare parts  and logistics services field service representatives and technical publications

table of contents cost of sales and gross profit for the year ended december  in thousands cost of sales gross margin percentage the gross margin decreased by percentage points for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the gross margin was impacted by percentage points as a result of gdls subcontract activity  whereby we recognized no gross profit on million of vehicles sold that were produced by gdls 
we also incurred a write down of our raw material and supplies to their net realizable values in the amount of million  and we incurred a loss of million on firm commitments to acquire raw materials and supplies 
see note  inventories  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to operational inefficiencies  and the use of contract labor in the production process 
we define the gross margin percentage as net sales less cost of sales divided by net sales 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to leveraging selling and administrative support functions over an increasing business base  partially offset by a liquidated damage charge of million  and a reserve for unsettled litigation as of december  see note  other current liabilities  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
significant year over year cost increases included salary  wages and fringe benefits  consultant and temporary labor  depreciation and information technology expenses to support the increased size of the business 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales research and development expense increased by approximately million primarily due to increased expenditures related to the development of the cheetah vehicle 
we also increased research and development spending on upgrades and variants of the buffalo and cougar vehicles 
other income other income increased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  primarily due to the interest income earned on investment of the funds received from our december private placement of common stock 

table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the repayment of a short term loan in august and the termination of an accounts receivable factoring agreement in june facilitated by the sale of common stock through private placements  partially offset by the bank fees associated with the line of credit

such vehicle sales represent approximately and  respectively  of the vehicles sold in net sales the increase in net sales for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  is attributable to both an increase in volume of vehicle deliveries to the us government under our government contracts as well as the mix of vehicles delivered as set forth in the following table for the year ended december  percentage change in thousands buffalo cougar all variants spare parts and logistics 
table of contents cost of sales and gross profit for the year ended december  in thousands cost of sales gross margin percentage the gross margin increased by percentage points for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to volume growth  improved material and labor cost performance as a result of implementation of new and improved manufacturing processes  and leveraging of fixed costs over an increased production volume

other income other income increased for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  primarily due to earnings on significantly higher cash balances 
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december  due to interest on debt that was outstanding for more months in than the debt was incurred in november and repaid in august 
table of contents realized gain on derivative liability the warrants issued in conjunction with the series d convertible preferred stock were initially recorded at fair value as a liability  as liquidating damages were paid as a result of a late sec registration of the underlying common stock 
the black scholes method was used to determine the fair value at issuance using a three year holding period 
each reporting period  these warrants were adjusted to the new fair value using the black scholes method until the registration was accepted by the sec 
at that point  the fair value using the black scholes method was reclassified into equity 
a realized gain on derivative liability in the amount of million was recorded in as a result of the change in fair value at issuance to reclassification to equity for these warrants 
income tax expense benefit as of december   the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million was eliminated since we expect to realize future earnings sufficient to fully utilize the accumulated income tax benefit

current liquidity and capital resources during the first six months of  we expended approximately million to complete the expansion of our manufacturing capability and capacity and to upgrade our information technology infrastructure 
we will continue to expand capital for research and development and business development activities 
the amount of capital that we will require depends on several factors  including without limitation  the extent and timing of sales of our products  inventory costs  costs of raw material and components  labor costs  costs of improving our financial and accounting systems  the timing and costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing  development  engineering and customer support capabilities  the timing and cost of our product development and enhancement activities and our operating results 
we currently estimate that the cash flow that we anticipate will be generated by our business plus the million available under our line of credit and our expected renewal of it will be sufficient to meet our presently budgeted capital expenditures and our other presently anticipated cash needs for the year ending december  we expect that we may require additional sources of capital after that time 
we may therefore be required to obtain additional sources of capital  which may include borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  including common stock  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms of any such financing will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our shareholders 
any failure to obtain necessary capital as and when required could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discussion addresses each of the above items for the company 
as of december   we do not have any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts as defined above 
as of december   we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 

table of contents as of december   we do not hold derivative financial instruments  as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
contractual obligations achieving optimal returns on cash often involves making long term commitments 
sec regulations require that we present our contractual obligations  and we have done so in the table that follows 
however  our future cash flow prospects cannot reasonably be assessed based on such obligations  as the most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from our customers 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  will vary based on our future needs 
while some such outflows are completely fixed for example  commitments to repay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings  most will depend on future events for example  payments to subcontractors under long term contracts 
further  normal operations involve significant expenditures that are not based on commitments for example  amounts paid for income taxes or for payroll 
our consolidated contractual obligations as of december   are as follows in thousands total and thereafter operating lease obligations a b d purchase obligations b c d other long term liabilities d e total a we lease most of our facilities as well as other property and equipment under operating leases in the normal course of business 
some of our facility leases contain escalation clauses 
the minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  property and equipment  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
b future operating lease obligations and purchase obligations are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on force protection and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
d because our future cash outflows are uncertain  the following liabilities are excluded from the table above workers compensation risks  deferred income taxes  warranty reserve  and our estimated liability for unsettled litigation 
for more information  see note  income taxes  and note  contingencies and other commitments  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents e includes accreted interest at for the non compete agreement portion and at for the equipment note portion of other long term liabilities 
dividends we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
payment of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments  and other factors the board deems relevant 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  definitization and advance payments on contracts  inventory costs and reserves  asset impairments depreciable lives of assets  economic lives and fair value of leased assets  income tax reserves and valuation allowances  fair value of stock options  allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales  and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value and net of the cost of excess and obsolete items 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory for which the resale value or replacement value is less than the inventoriable cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part  overall market conditions  and other inventory management initiatives 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventories 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
since december   we have not had a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  we establish reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
contingent tax liabilities are based on our assessment of the likelihood that we have incurred a liability 
such liabilities are reviewed based on recent changes in tax laws and regulations  including judicial rulings 
assessment of loss contingencies we have legal and other contingencies  including product warranties  which could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
we have provided for losses in situations where we have concluded that it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in determining the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial statement impact of such events 
if further developments or resolution of a contingent matter are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period related to an existing contingency

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
if the price of steel increases significantly  the cost of our products could increase 
it is unlikely we will be able to pass on this cost under our current contracts 
as a result  if the cost of our raw material increases  our profitability  if any  could decrease

interest rates as we do not have a trading portfolio and although our current financing arrangement is at a variable rate  we do not have any borrowings under the arrangement 
as a result  we are not currently directly at risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as our financing needs change in the future  interest rate risk may become a more significant issue for us 
currently  we do not use any derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange  or commodity prices
