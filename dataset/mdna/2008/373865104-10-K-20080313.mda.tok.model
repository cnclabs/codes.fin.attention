this merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies and estimatesintroduction the financial condition and results of operations for german american bancorp  inc presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that the company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of securities available for sale  and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans  and consideration of past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of two components of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function 
the need for specific reserves is considered for credits when graded substandard or special mention  or when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages  including those graded substandard or special mention and non performing consumer or residential real estate loans 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans  homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
securities valuation securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the company obtains market values from a third party on a monthly basis in order to adjust the securities to fair value 
equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried at cost 
additionally  all securities are required to be written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  therefore  future changes in the fair value of securities could have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
in determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary  management considers the reason for the decline  the extent of the decline and the duration of the decline 
as of december   gross unrealized losses on the securities available for sale portfolio totaled approximately  income tax expense income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carryback and carryforward periods  including consideration of available tax planning strategies 
as of december   the company had a deferred tax asset of  which includes tax credit carryforwards of  based on the long carryforward periods available  management has assessed it more likely than not that these credits will be realized and no valuation allowance has been established on this asset 
tax related loss contingencies  including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in considering the likelihood of loss  management considers the nature of the contingency  the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal  the views of legal counsel and other advisors  experience of the company or other enterprises in similar matters  if any  and management s intended response to any assessment 
results of operations net income declined  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share in the decline in earnings during was largely the result of a  increase in the provision for loan losses 
partially mitigating the increased provision was an increase in net interest income of  non interest income declined  or during while non interest expense increased by  or less than during net income increased  or to  or per share in compared to  or per share during the increase in net income during compared with was attributable principally to an increase in net interest income of  a reduction in provision for loan losses of  and a gain on the sale of the company s portfolio of agency preferred stock of  which were partially mitigated by an increase of  in non interest expense 
the increases in net interest income and non interest expenses were largely attributable to acquisitions of pcb holding company and stone city bancshares  inc  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income increased  or an increase of  or on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended compared with the increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increased level of average earning assets for the year ended compared with the higher level of earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in the average level of loans outstanding  and in particular a higher level of average commercial and agricultural loans

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
the provision is affected by net charge offs on loans and changes in specific and general allocations required on the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the increased level of provision for loan losses during was largely attributable to a write down of a single non performing credit facility secured by two hotel properties at the time the properties were acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure and moved into other real estate owned during the first quarter of during the first quarter of  the write down and additional provision for loan loss on this credit totaled  with an additional  in indirect provision charges recognized due to the impact of this write down on the company s historical loss ratios and resulting required reserve levels 
also contributing to the elevated level of provision during was the company s loan growth 
finally  another contributing factor to the elevated levels of provision during the year ended december  compared with was the finalization of settlement of a large non performing credit in the second quarter of the company recognized a charge off of approximately  on this individual credit facility 
the specific allocation as of year end was for considerably more than the level of charge off allowing the company to recover the balance of the specific allocation assigned to the credit during  impacting the comparability of and provision for loan losses 
the company s provision for loan losses declined during in conjunction with a decline in the company s level of non performing loans 
the largest factor in the company s ability to recognize the reduced level of provision for loan losses was the finalization of settlement of a previously identified large nonperforming credit in the second quarter of that was previously discussed 
these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated  probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which are used to determine provisions for loan losses 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
refer also to the sections entitled critical accounting policies and estimates and risk management lending and loan administration for further discussion of the provision and allowance for loan losses

service charges on deposit accounts increased  or during as compared to these increases were largely attributable to increased usage and fees associated with the company s overdraft protection service program 
insurance revenues increased  or during as compared the increase in insurance revenues during was attributable primarily to commission income from keach and grove insurance  inc which was acquired october  and thereby not included in the company results during the first nine months of insurance revenues increased for as compared the increased insurance revenues were primarily the result of a higher level of contingency revenues during compared with  and the revenues generated from the previously mentioned insurance agency acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of for more information on the business combination  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

loan sales for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the net gain loss on securities declined by  during compared with during the company recognized a  net loss on securities related to the company s portfolio of non controlling investments in other banking organizations 
the net loss resulted from the sale of one of the investment holdings at a modest gain and the recognition of an other than temporary impairment expense in connection with the valuation of other holdings within the portfolio 
the company recognized a gain on the sale of its portfolio of fhlmc and fnma preferred stock during the gain from the sale of this agency preferred stock portfolio totaled  the portfolio had a book value at the time of the sale of approximately million

average borrowed funds increased million or during following an increase of million or in borrowings comprised approximately of average total funding sources in   and the increase in average borrowed funds during was largely attributable to parent company borrowings that resulted from the banking acquisition activity during late and early certificates of deposits in denominations of  or more and brokered deposits are an additional source of other funding for the company s bank subsidiary 
large denomination certificates and brokered deposits increased million or during following an increase of million or in large certificates and brokered deposits comprised approximately of average total funding sources in  in and in this type of funding is used as both long term and short term funding sources 
the increase in this type of funding was used primarily as a funding source for the company s significant loan growth during and the bank subsidiary of the company also utilizes short term funding sources from time to time 
these sources consist of overnight federal funds purchased from other financial institutions  secured repurchase agreements that generally mature within one day of the transaction date  and secured overnight variable rate borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings represent an important source of short term liquidity for the company s bank subsidiary 
long term debt at the company s bank subsidiary is in the form of fhlb advances  which are secured by the pledge of certain investment securities and residential and housing related mortgage loans

the company uses funds at the parent company level to pay dividends to its shareholders  to acquire or make other investments in other businesses or their securities or assets  to repurchase its stock from time to time  and for other general corporate purposes 
the parent company does not have access at the parent company level to the deposits and certain other sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiary to support its operations

risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in the loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s subsidiary bank 
loan personnel at the subsidiary bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
the executive loan committee serves as a vehicle for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
the committee provides valuable input to lending personnel  acts as an approval body  and monitors the overall quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the corporate credit risk management committee  comprised of members of the company s and its subsidiary bank s executive officers and board of directors  strives to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk grading and loan review program  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable  incurred credit losses identified during its loan review process 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b general reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

also contributing to the increased level of allowance for loan losses was an elevated level of net charge offs during and and the effect of those charge offs on the company s historic loss ratios and the resulting required level of loan loss reserves 
net charge offs totaled million in or of average loans outstanding during this compares to net charge offs of million or of average loans outstanding during and million or of average loans outstanding in a significant portion of the elevated net charge offs during was largely attributable to a single hotel credit facility 
see results of operations provision for loan losses and risk management non performing assets for detailed discussion of this credit facility and net charge off 
the allowance for loan losses at year end declined to million or of total loans compared to million or of total loans at year end the decline in the allowance for loan losses was largely attributable to a higher level of net charge offs  primarily related to three commercial credit facilities  during as compared with previous years 
the increased level of net charge offs during and to a lesser degree in had been provided for during and therefore  the provision for loan loss declined by  in compared with please see results of operations provision for loan losses and critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for loan losses for additional information regarding the allowance 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected accrued interest is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are typically charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s non performing assets 
non performing assets december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans past due loans days or more restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans the company s level of overall non performing assets declined by approximately million and non performing loans declined by approximately million during compared with year end these changes were primarily related to one credit facility which is discussed in detail below 
at december   a single credit facility  which was extended to a borrower that owned and operated two hotel facilities  was largely responsible for the elevated level of non performing loans compared with year end this facility included extensions of credit in the approximate amount of million after a partial charge off during that were secured by a first priority lien on the hotel properties 
in late march   the company acquired deeds in lieu of foreclosure of these two hotel properties and placed the hotels under control of an independent management company pending their sale 
on april   the company agreed to sell the two hotels  subject to conventional financing by the company  to an unaffiliated purchaser for a sales price of approximately million  net of the costs of sale 
the sale of the properties closed on april  the net effect of these activities was to decrease the level of the company s non performing assets at year end by the entire million year end carrying value of the credit secured by the hotel facilities 
during the first quarter of  the company charged the difference of million against its allowance for loan losses and recorded a corresponding expense to provision for loan losses 
in connection with the company s agreement with its borrower under which the deeds to the hotels were acquired in lieu of foreclosure  one of the principals of the borrower executed and delivered to the company s subsidiary bank a ten year monthly installment personal promissory note in the principal amount of million 
due to substantial uncertainty about the personal financial ability of the obligor under the note to pay it in accordance with its terms  the company has not recognized any value for this personal note in its financial statements 
if  and to the extent that  this obligor continues to pay installments under the note in accordance with its terms  or the note is otherwise sold or liquidated for value by the company  the company could recover some of this charge off in future periods 
through december   all payments have been made in accordance with the terms of the note 
the largest remaining credit facility included in non performing assets is an approximately  loan after a partial charge off during to a manufacturing entity which has ceased operations 
during the third quarter of  the real estate and equipment of the manufacturing entity were sold at auction to an unrelated third party 
the closing of this auction sale has been delayed on a number of instances as various covenants and conditions included in the sales agreement have not been fully performed or satisfied 
based on current information available  the company expects that this sale will be completed in the first half of the preceding is a forward looking statement  however  which is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  and the closing of the expected sale could be delayed further or terminated if the covenants and conditions of the parties to the sale are not performed by the parties to the sale over which the company has no control in a timely manner 
the indebtedness owed the company on this credit is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the borrower s assets  including those sold at auction 
the company s level of overall non performing assets declined by approximately million and non performing loans declined by approximately million during compared with year end the decline in the level of non accrual loans largely resulted from the resolution of an approximately million credit facility  which was extended to a borrower operating a retail grocery store chain 
under an approved bankruptcy plan  the company was paid approximately of the amount owed to it during april the remaining decline in non accrual loans was principally the result of partial charge offs that totaled million on two other commercial credit facilities that were previously discussed in this section 
loan impairment is reported when full repayment under the terms of the loan is not expected 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
commercial and industrial loans and agricultural loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include real estate loans secured by one to four family residences and loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures 
individually evaluated loans on non accrual are generally considered impaired 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
the total dollar amount of impaired loans at december  was  for additional detail on impaired loans  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
interest income recognized on non performing loans for was  the gross interest income that would have been recognized in on non performing loans if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was  loans are typically placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary bank to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiary  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon term financing arrangements and a line of credit established by the parent company with a correspondent bank lender as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the affiliate bank s source of funding is predominately core deposits  time deposits in excess of  and brokered certificates of deposit  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company s asset liability committee monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than stand by letters of credit as disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee and board of directors 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to decrease under both an increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands

actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied therein as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties expressed above  those that are described in management s discussion and analysis in item of this report  and those that are described in item of this report  business  under the caption forward looking statements and associated risks  which discussions are incorporated herein by reference
