item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in the section entitled risk factors 
overview dusa is a vertically integrated dermatology company that is developing and marketing levulan pdt and other products for common skin conditions 
the products we currently market include  among others levulan kerastick topical solution with photodynamic therapy  the blu u brand light source  certain products acquired in the march  merger with sirius including  nicomide  nicomide t  and clindareach 
historically  we devoted most of our resources to advancing the development and marketing of our levulan pdt pd technology platform 
in addition to our marketed products  our drug  levulan brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl  or ala  in combination with light  has been studied in a broad range of medical conditions 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to treat a medical condition  it is known as levulan pdt 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to detect medical conditions  it is known as levulan photodetection  or levulan pd 
our kerastick is the proprietary applicator that delivers levulan 
the levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt and the blu u brand light source were launched in the us in september for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp under a former dermatology collaboration 
aks are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that can develop over time into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  in september we received clearance from the fda to market the blu u without levulan pdt for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
sirius  a dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company  was founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
nicomide  its key product  is an oral prescription vitamin supplement which is targeted to the market for inflammatory skin conditions such as acne 
the merger has allowed us to expand our product portfolio with the launch of clindareach in march  capitalize on cross selling and marketing opportunities  and increase the size of our sales force 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standards no   goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we use december st as the date of our annual goodwill impairment test 
based on the review  we have recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
the impairment charge is primarily driven by our revised estimate of cash flows 
table of contents associated with the sirius products and product pipeline 
decisions related to the product pipeline were based on a number of factors  most importantly  dusa s development partner s  altana  inc s  recent receipt of a non approvable letter from the fda with respect to its anda supplement covering one of the potential products we acquired from sirius 
we no longer expect to launch this product 
we manufacture our levulan kerastick in our own facility  while our other products are manufactured by third parties 
we are responsible for the regulatory  sales  marketing  and customer service and other related product activities for our levulan kerastick and for all of our products 
our current objectives include increasing the sales of our products in the united states  canada  latin america  and korea  launching levulan with our partners in brazil and other latin american countries and asia  continuing to explore partnership opportunities for levulan pdt for dermatology in europe and japan  continuing our levulan pdt clinical development program for the moderate to severe acne indication 
we are working toward having a distribution agreement in place for japan by the end of the second quarter of to further these objectives  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc in january granting stiefel an exclusive right to distribute the levulan kerastick in mexico  central and south america 
we have been actively working with stiefel to obtain acceptable final pricing from the brazilian regulatory authorities 
in light of the unexpected delay in receiving acceptable final pricing in brazil  in we amended certain terms of the original stiefel agreement to reflect our plans to launch in other latin american countries prior to brazil 
the product was launched in argentina  chile  colombia  and mexico during the fourth quarter of on march  stiefel notified us that the brazilian authorities had published the final pricing for the product which is acceptable to stiefel and to us 
we expect stiefel to launch the product in brazil shortly 
similarly  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd 
and dnc daewoong derma plastic surgery network company  or together  daewoong  granting daewoong exclusive rights to distribute the levulan kerastick in certain asian countries 
in the fourth quarter of the korean food and drug administration  or kfda  approved levulan kerastick for pdt for the treatment of actinic keratosis and daewoong launched our product 
we are developing levulan pdt and pd under an exclusive worldwide license of patents and technology from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
we also own or license certain other patents relating to methods for using pharmaceutical formulations which contain our drug and related processes and improvements 
in the united states  dusa  dusa pharmaceuticals  inc  levulan  kerastick  blu u nicomide  nicomide t  meted  psoriacap  psoriatec  avar  avar green  avar e  avar e green  and avar cleanser are registered trademarks we own or license 
several of these trademarks are also registered in europe  australia  canada  and in other parts of the world 
numerous other trademark applications are pending 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we believe that if operations continue as planned  we may be able to achieve profitability and be cash flow positive on a quarterly basis by the fourth quarter of achieving profitability in is dependent on our ability to continue to grow our pdt segment revenues  both internationally and domestically  our ability to regain the level of nicomide revenues we had attained without generic competition beginning in the second quarter of  and our ability to sustain that level of revenues for the remainder of the year 

table of contents we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our competitors include larger fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies 
many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals  and greater manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities than we do 
net revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our acquisition of sirius totaled  for the twelve month period ended december  and  for the period from march  date of acquisition through december  the substantial majority of these revenues were from sales of nicomide 
with the settlement of the river s edge litigation in  we expect moderate growth in our non pdt drug products revenues in  primarily due to the belief that existing quantities of nic in the distribution channel should be substantially depleted by the end of march and we should regain our market share beginning in the second quarter of our expectations for growth assume that there are no other products successfully introduced into the marketplace which would be substitutable for nicomide and that the fda does not take enforcement action against nicomide as a marketed unapproved drug 
we are pursuing an alternative labeling and distribution strategy that we believe we could deploy if the fda takes such action 
we have continued our efforts to penetrate the market by expanding our sales coverage in key geographic locations 
see the section entitled management s discussion and analysis results of operations  marketing and sales costs 
we are encouraged with the year over year increase in pdt sales  as well as the positive feedback we continue to receive from physicians across the country that believe levulan pdt should become a routine part of standard dermatological practice 
we are continuing to explore opportunities to develop  market  and distribute our levulan pdt platform in europe and expect that our distribution partners  stiefel for latin america and daewoong for asia will give the product increased visibility in the market and thereby advance our international strategy 
we are also continuing to seek to acquire and or license additional dermatology products that complement our current product portfolio that would provide our sales force with additional complementary products to sell in the near term 
certain of the products acquired in connection with the sirius merger must meet certain minimum manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda and applicable to products marketed without approved marketing applications including nicomide 
the fda regulates such products under its marketed unapproved drugs compliance policy guide entitled  marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  will not be the subject of any enforcement action 
the fda has recently taken a more proactive role and is strongly encouraging manufacturers of such products to submit applications to obtain marketing approval and we have begun discussions with the fda to begin that process 
the fda s enforcement discretion policy does not apply to drugs or firms that may be in violation of regulatory requirements other than preapproval submission requirements and the fda may bring an action against a drug or a firm when the fda concludes that such other violations exist 
the contract manufacturer of nicomide has received notice that the fda considers prescription dietary supplements to be unapproved new drugs that are misbranded and that cannot be legally marketed  and has received notice that the fda believes nicomide could not be marketed as a dietary supplement with its current labeling 
if the fda were to take further action  we may be required to make certain labeling changes and market nicomide as an over the counter product or as a dietary supplement under applicable legislation  or withdraw the product from the market  unless and until we submit a marketing application and obtain fda marketing approval 
any such action by the fda would have a material impact on our non pdt drug product revenues 

table of contents label changes eliminating claims of certain medicinal benefits could make it more difficult to market nicomide and could therefore  negatively affect our revenues and profits 
shortly after the closing of the merger with sirius  we became engaged in patent litigation with river s edge pharmaceuticals llc  or river s edge  a company that launched a niacinamide based product 
river s edge also requested that the united states patent and trademark office  or uspto  reexamine the nicomide patent claiming that it is invalid 
the uspto accepted the application for reexamination of the patent and the parties submitted their responses to the first office action 
although the court issued a preliminary injunction against sales of river s edge s product in may  the injunction was lifted on march   due  in part  to the court s determination that the reexamination process by the uspto presented sufficient changed circumstances to warrant the dissolution of the injunction 
on october   we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release  or settlement agreement  and a license agreement with river s edge ending the litigation 
on march   the uspto vacated the reexamination 
see the section entitled legal proceedings river s edge 
nicomide sales were adversely impacted throughout the litigation process and had a material negative impact on our revenues  results of operations and liquidity 
with the settlement of the river s edge litigation in  we expect moderate growth in our non pdt drug products revenues in we believe that issues related to reimbursement negatively impacted the economic competitiveness of our therapy with other ak therapies and hindered its adoption in the past 
we have continued to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians 
such efforts included working with the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the american academy of dermatology association on matters related to pdt related procedures fee and the separate drug reimbursement 
in addition  in many cases  physicians can also bill for any applicable office visit reimbursements 
we continue to support ongoing efforts that might lead to further increases in reimbursement in the future  and intend to continue supporting efforts to seek reimbursement for our fda cleared use of the blu u alone in the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne of the face 
effective in january  the national medicare average reimbursement amount for our pdt related procedure fee increased by approximately 
we believe that with increased reimbursement for our pdt related procedure fee  including the increase in january  our treatment is increasingly financially viable for practitioners  and more competitive with alternative ak therapies from a practice management perspective 
most major private insurers have approved coverage for our ak therapy 
we believe that due to these efforts  plus potential future improvements  along with our education and marketing programs  a more widespread adoption of our therapy should occur over time 
we recognize that we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
since we cannot predict when product sales may offset the costs associated with these efforts  we expect that we will continue to generate operating losses through we are aware that physicians have been using levulan with the blu u using short incubation times  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  we believe that these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 
as of december   we had a staff of employees  including part time employees  as compared to full time employees  including part time employees  at the end of  including marketing and sales  production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations personnel  as well as those who support research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
at december   our sales force was comprised 
table of contents of employees 
during  with the addition of the sales force from sirius we increased the size of our sales force to from at the end of we may add and or replace employees during as business circumstances deem necessary 
transactions during  dusa entered into a number of transactions winston laboratories  inc on or about january   winston laboratories  inc  or winston  and the former sirius entered into a license agreement relating to a sirius product  psoriatec known by winston as micanol revising a former agreement 
the original micanol license agreement granted an exclusive license  with limitation on rights to sublicense  to all property rights  including all intellectual property and improvements  owned or controlled by winston to manufacture  sell and distribute products containing anthralin  in the united states 
on january   our wholly owned subsidiary  sirius  entered into the micanol transition license agreement with winston 
the transition license agreement amends the original micanol license agreement which was due to expire pursuant to its terms on january  the parties entered into the transition license agreement to extend the term of the micanol license agreement to september  in order to allow dusa to sell its last batch of product  to reduce the period of time that we are required to maintain product liability insurance with respect to its distribution and sale of products containing anthralin after the termination of the transition license agreement and to confirm the allocation of certain costs and expenses relating to the product during and after the transition period 
we will pay royalties on net sales of psoriatec  but we are no longer required to pay winston a minimum royalty to maintain the license 
private placement on october   we entered into a securities purchase agreement  common stock purchase warrants  and a registration rights agreement with several investors for the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share which resulted in gross proceeds to us of  and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock 
the warrants become exercisable on april   have a term of five years from the initial exercise date  and have an exercise price of per share 
on november   we registered the shares of common stock issued in the transaction and the shares underlying the warrants with the securities and exchange commission for resale on a registration statement on form s on january   we filed an amended registration statement on form s a 
this registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on january  the warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
river s edge on march   a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia  gainesville division by river s edge pharmaceuticals  llc  or river s edge  against us alleging  among other things  that  prior to the merger with dusa  sirius agreed to authorize river s edge to market a generic version of nicomide  and that the united states patent covering nicomide issued to sirius in december is invalid 
nicomide is the key product dusa acquired from sirius in its merger 
river s edge also filed an application with the us patent and trademark office requesting reexamination of the nicomide patent 
on april   we filed a patent infringement suit in the united states 
table of contents district court in trenton  new jersey alleging that the river s edge niacinamide product infringes us patent no 
 on october   we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to resolve all claims arising out of the litigation 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  river s edge unconditionally acknowledged the validity and enforceability of the nicomide patent  made a lump sum settlement payment to dusa in the amount of  for damages and agreed to pay to dusa for every bottle of nic above  bottles that is substituted for nicomide after september  river s edge is responsible for all returns of nic from the distribution chain and or order its destruction and will immediately cease the manufacture  distribution and sale of nic river s edge withdrew from and ceased participating in the re examination of our nicomide patent and consented to the return to us of the  bond  which was received by us during the fourth quarter of on march   the us patent and trademark office vacated the reexamination of the nicomide patent 
as part of the settlement  dusa and river s edge have also entered into a license agreement  dated october   whereby dusa granted a perpetual  exclusive license to river s edge to manufacture and sell four of products from the avar line  including avar cleanser  avar gel  avar e emollient cream and avar e green in exchange for a royalty on net sales of these products  including a guaranteed minimum royalty of  payable in equal annual installments of  for three years 
dusa provided its on hand inventory of these products to river s edge for no cost 
we recorded a gain of  shown as net gain from settlement of litigation  and will record royalties  as earned  in product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
stiefel laboratories  inc in january   we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc  or stiefel  covering current and future uses of our proprietary levulan kerastick for pdt in dermatology 
the agreement  grants stiefel an exclusive right to distribute  promote and sell the levulan kerastick in the western hemisphere from and including mexico south  and all other countries in the caribbean  excluding united states territories 
we will manufacture and supply to stiefel on an exclusive basis in the territory all of stiefel s reasonable requirements for the product 
the agreement has an initial term of ten years 
the mexican  argentinean  colombian  and on march  the brazilian regulatory authorities have granted their respective approvals to market the product 
in september  in light of the unexpected delay in receiving acceptable final pricing in brazil  we amended certain terms of the original stiefel agreement to reflect our plans to launch in other latin american countries prior to brazil 
during the third quarter of  our first shipments were released to argentina and mexico 
pursuant to the amendment  stiefel will make aggregate milestone payments to us of up to  rather than up to  under the agreement based upon i launch of the product in either mexico or argentina which has been paid  ii upon receipt of acceptable pricing approval in brazil  and iii achievement of pre determined minimum purchase levels in the territory 
in addition  the transfer price for the product was amended to set a fixed price plus a royalty on net sales  rather than a revenue sharing arrangement as under the agreement 
we believe that the amended transfer price reduces some of the risk related to currency and market price fluctuations during the ten year term of the agreement 
the parties have certain rights to terminate the agreement prior to the end of the initial term  and stiefel has an option to extend the term for an additional ten years on mutually agreeable terms and conditions 
revenues associated with this agreement are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no

daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd 
on january   we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with daewoong covering current and future uses of the levulan kerastick for pdt 
table of contents in dermatology 
the agreement grants daewoong exclusive rights to distribute  promote and sell the levulan kerastick in korea  taiwan  china  including without limitation hong kong  india  indonesia  malaysia  philippines  singapore  thailand and vietnam 
we will manufacture and supply the product to daewoong on certain terms and conditions

daewoong will complete final integration and submission on our behalf of all registrations and regulatory filings for the product in the territory 
under the terms of the agreement  daewoong will make up to  in milestone payments to us   of which was paid on signing  and  of which was paid upon receipt of korean regulatory approval of the product 
the remaining milestones are based upon achievement of pre determined cumulative sales targets in the territory subject to certain terms and conditions 
in order to maintain its exclusive rights  daewoong is obligated to purchase a certain number of units of the product and meet certain regulatory timelines 
we will manufacture the product in our facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
we will also receive a minimum transfer price per unit plus a percentage of daewoong s end user price above a certain level 
revenues associated with this agreement are recorded in accordance with eitf levulan lawsuits filed since december  we have filed lawsuits against physicians in several states to prevent their unlicensed use of versions of our levulan brand of ala produced  by third parties for use in our patented pdt treatment for actinic keratosis  basal cell carcinoma  or acne 
the suits alleged that these physicians performed patient treatments that are covered under patents exclusively licensed by dusa  resulting in direct infringement of these patent s 
additionally  some physicians were sued for infringement of dusa s trademarks and for violations of the lanham act for using the levulan brand name on their web sites and promotional materials  but performing patient treatments with ala obtained from other sources 
as of the end of  all of the lawsuits against physicians have settled favorably to us and dusa has the right to review the physician s books and records to verify ongoing compliance 
we have also sued two compounding pharmacies which we believed were inducing physicians to infringe our patents on the photodynamic treatment of acne or actinic keratosis 
these compounding pharmacies were selling ala to those physicians 
both of the suits against the compounding pharmacies have been resolved in dusa s favor  and dusa has the right to review their books and records to verify ongoing compliance 
during  we sued chemical suppliers in united states district court for the district of arizona and the district of utah  and a light device manufacturer  a distributor  and a sales representative in united states district court for the southern district of ohio  eastern division  alleging that these defendants induced physicians to infringe patents licensed to us  among other things 
during  these cases have been resolved in dusa s favor  with dusa having the right to review their books and records to verify ongoing compliance 
while we believe that certain actions of compounding pharmacies and others go beyond the activities which are permitted under the food  drug and cosmetic act and have advised the fda and local health authorities of our concerns  we cannot be certain that our lawsuits will be successful in curbing the practices of these companies or that regulatory authorities will intervene to stop their activities 
in addition  there may be other compounding pharmacies which are following fda guidelines  or others conducting illegal activities of which we are not aware  which may be negatively impacting our sales revenues 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross revenues we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounting for revenue transactions relies on certain estimates that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments on the part of management 
for revenues associated with contractual agreements with multiple deliverables  we apply the revenue recognition criteria outlined in sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition sab topic and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  revenues from contractual agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of those agreements 
as prescribed by eitf  we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting and then recognize revenue for those separated units at their fair values as earned in accordance with the sab topic or other applicable revenue recognition guidance 
photodynamic therapy pdt drug and device products revenues on the kerastick and blu u product sales in the us and canada are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is probable 
product sales made through distributors  historically  have been recorded as deferred revenue until the product was sold by the distributors to the end users because we did not have sufficient history with our distributors to be able to reliably estimate returns 
beginning in the first quarter of  we began recognizing revenue as product is sold to distributors because we believe we have sufficient history to reliably estimate returns from distributors beginning january  this change in estimate was not material to our revenues or results of operations 
we offer programs that allow physicians access to our blu u device for a trial period 
no revenue is recognized on these units until the physician elects to purchase the equipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have entered into exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreements with distributors in latin america and korea that contain multiple deliverables 
revenues on the kerastick product sales made under these agreements are recorded in accordance with eitf as described below 
stiefel laboratories agreement 
in january  as amended in september  we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc for levulan pdt in latin america 
under the agreement  stiefel is required to purchase levulan kerastick from us and make up front  milestone and royalty payments 
stiefel may cancel the agreement if there is a breach of contract  if either party files for bankruptcy  if its 
table of contents sales during any year are less than its minimum purchase obligations  or  as to brazil only  if acceptable pricing approval  as defined in the agreement  is not obtained 
no upfront or milestone payments are refundable in any instance 
product shipments are subject to return and refund only if the product does not comply with technical specifications 
we are obligated under the agreement to provide multiple deliverables  the primary deliverables being license product distribution rights and commercial product supply 
the agreement establishes a fixed supply price per unit  as well as a royalty based on a percentage of the net sales price to end users 
under eitf the deliverables under the agreement are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we determine attribution methods for each of the separate payment streams 
revenues from unit sales of levulan kerastick are recognized based on end user demand as we do not have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace and therefore do not have the ability to estimate product returns 
royalty revenues are recorded each quarter based on stiefel s reported net sales for that quarter and are included in product revenues 
the agreement also establishes minimum purchase quantities over the first five years following regulatory approval 
the non refundable up front payments are being recognized into revenues on a straight line basis commencing upon the first product shipments in a country over the remaining contractual term of the agreement  which is years 
milestone payments based on cumulative units shipped into a country will initially be deferred and then recognized on a straight line basis over the then remaining contractual term  with a cumulative catch up based on the number of years into the contract such milestone is attained 
as of december   in accordance with our policy of deferring revenues on new product launches  we have deferred revenues of  related to product shipments of levulan kerastick into mexico and argentina that have not yet been sold through to the end user customers 
deferred revenues at december  associated with milestone payments received from stiefel are  daewoong agreement 
on january   we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement the agreement with daewoong for levulan pdt in korea see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the agreement  daewoong is required to purchase levulan kerastick from us and make up front and milestone payments 
daewoong may cancel the agreement only if there is a breach of contract or if either party files for bankruptcy 
under the terms of the agreement  daewoong will make up to million in milestone payments to us  million of which was paid upon contract execution during the first quarter of and another million of which was paid during the fourth quarter of upon achieving regulatory approval in korea 
the milestone payments are non refundable 
product shipments are subject to return and refund only if the product does not comply with technical specifications 
we are obligated under the agreement to provide multiple deliverables  the primary deliverables being license product distribution rights and commercial product supply 
the agreement establishes a fixed supply price per unit  as well as an excess purchase price component if the average selling price to end users exceeds a certain threshold 
under eitf the deliverables under the agreement are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we determine attribution methods for each of the separate payment streams 
revenues from unit sales of levulan are recognized based on end user demand as we do not have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace and therefore do not have the ability to estimate product returns 
excess purchase price revenues are recorded each quarter based on daewoong s reported net sales for that quarter and are included in product revenues 
the agreement also establishes minimum purchase quantities over the first five years following regulatory approval in korea 
the non refundable up front payments are recognized into revenues on a straight line basis commencing upon the first product shipment in the territory over the remaining contractual 
table of contents term of the agreement  which is years 
milestone payments based on cumulative units shipped into a country will initially be deferred and then recognized on a straight line basis over the then remaining contractual term  with a cumulative catch up based on the number of years into the contract such milestone is attained 
as of december   in accordance with our policy of deferring revenues on new product launches  we have deferred revenues of  related to product shipments of levulan kerastick into korea that have not yet been sold through to the end user customers 
deferred revenues at december  associated with milestone payments received from daewoong are  photocure agreement 
on may   we entered into a patent license agreement under which we granted photocure asa a non exclusive license under the patents we license from parteq for ala esters 
in addition  we granted a non exclusive license to photocure for its existing formulations of hexvix and metvix known in the us as metvixia for any patent we own now or in the future 
photocure is obligated to pay us royalties on sales of its ester products to the extent they are covered by our patents in the us and certain other territories 
as part of the agreement  photocure paid us a prepaid royalty in the amount of million 
revenues recognized pursuant to the photocure agreement have not been material to date 
the balance of the prepaid royalty under the photocure agreement is included in deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
non pdt drug products we recognize revenue for sales of non pdt drug products when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment to wholesale customers  with the exceptions described below 
revenue is recognized net of revenue reserves  which consist of allowances for discounts  returns  rebates  chargebacks and fees paid to wholesalers under distribution service agreements 
in the case of sales made to wholesalers as a result of incentives and that are in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and  accordingly  such sales are recorded as deferred revenue and the related costs as deferred cost of revenue until the product is sold through to the wholesalers customers on a first in  first out basis 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesaler customers  which account for the vast majority of its sales in the non pdt drug products segment  through an analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler shipments to retailers  available end user prescription data obtained from third parties and on hand inventory data received directly from our three largest wholesaler customers 
we believe that this evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels  allows us to make reasonable estimates for its applicable revenue related reserves 
additionally  our products are sold to wholesalers with a product shelf life that allows sufficient time for its wholesaler customers to sell its products in their inventory through to retailers and  ultimately  to end user consumers prior to product expiration 
for new product launches where we do not have the ability to reliably estimate returns  revenue is recognized based on end user demand  which is typically based on dispensed subscription data  or ship through data as reported by our international distribution partners 
when inventories have been reduced to targeted stocking levels at wholesalers or distribution partners  and we have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace which allows us to estimate product returns  we recognize revenue upon shipment  net of discounts and allowances 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized  of revenues that had previously been deferred related to the clindareach launch in march 
table of contents sales returns we account for sales returns in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned 
we determine the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales and related returns and incorporating other factors that could impact sales returns in the future 
these other factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated shelf life  product recalls  product discontinuances  price changes of competitive products  introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products 
our policy is to accept returns when product is within six months of expiration 
we consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
in the pdt drug and device products segment  product sales made through distributors  historically  had been recorded as deferred revenue until the product was sold by the distributors to the end users because we did not have sufficient history with our distributors to be able to reliably estimate returns 
beginning in the first quarter of  we began recognizing revenue as product is sold to distributors because we believe we have sufficient history to reliably estimate returns from distributors beginning january  this change in estimate was not material to our revenues or results of operations 
chargebacks  rebates and discounts chargebacks typically occur when suppliers enter into contractual pricing arrangements with end user customers  including certain federally mandated programs  who then purchase from wholesalers at prices below what the supplier charges the wholesaler 
since we only offer preferred pricing to end user customers under federally mandated programs  chargebacks have not been significant 
our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following two types medicaid rebates and consumer rebates 
medicaid rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
consumer rebates are amounts owed as a result of mail in coupons that are distributed by health care providers to consumers at the time a prescription is written 
we offer our wholesaler customers a prompt pay discount 
we evaluate the amount accrued for prompt pay discounts by analyzing the unpaid invoices in its accounts receivable aging subject to a prompt pay discount 
prompt pay discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated based on actual and expected activity at each reporting date 
we record these discounts at the time of sale and they are accounted for as a reduction of revenues 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory reserves  if any  that are necessary at each balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived  intangible assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis

based on the review  we have recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million  which was all associated with the non pdt drug products reporting unit and represented the entire goodwill balance 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the impairment charge is primarily related to our revised estimate of cash flows associated with the sirius products and product pipeline 
decisions related to the product pipeline are based on a number of factors  most importantly  our development partner s  altana  inc s  receipt of a non approvable letter from the fda in the fourth quarter of with respect to its anda supplement covering one of the potential products we acquired from sirius 
we no longer expect to launch this product or any other potential product from the sirius acquisition 
we paid and or accrued  in milestone payments in the fourth quarter of as a result of our decision not to pursue any additional potential products from the acquisition

we adopted sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method  and beginning with the first quarter of  we measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record share based compensation expense in our financial statements if the requisite service to earn the award is provided 
the pro forma results and assumptions used in fiscal year were based solely on historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the adoption of sfas no

the warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities at fair value in accordance with sfas the warrants do not meet the criteria in paragraph a of sfas that a contract should not be considered a derivative instrument if it is indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders equity 
changes in fair value of derivative liabilities are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
we record the warrant liability at its fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and revalue it at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expire 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in our statements of operations as non operating income or expense 
the fair value of the warrants is subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in our stock price  expected volatility  remaining contractual life and the risk free interest rate

our average net selling price for the kerastick increased to for the year ended december  from in our average net selling price for the kerastick includes sales made directly to our end user customers  as well as sales made to our distributors  in the united states  canada  korea and the rest of world 
the increase in kerastick revenues was driven mainly by increased sales volumes in the united states and internationally  through our distribution agreements with stiefel and daewoong  and an increase in our average unit selling price 
we believe our kerastick sales were negatively impacted in by the warning letter we received from the fda in early relative to our marketing material

non pdt drug product revenues reflect the revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our march  acquisition of sirius 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the period from march  date of acquisition through december  the substantial majority of the non pdt product revenues were from sales of nicomide 
nicomide sales in were significantly 
table of contents impacted by the introduction into the market of nic  a niacinamide product that was substituted for nicomide  which was re launched in march following the dissolution by the court of a preliminary injunction 
we have since reached a settlement agreement with river s edge  the manufacturer of nic the settlement agreement is described further in item legal proceedings river s edge 
the increase in our total revenues results from increased pdt segment revenues in the united states  as well as our pdt product launches in korea and the rest of world 
however  we must increase sales significantly from these levels in order for us to become profitable 
we remain confident that sales should continue to increase through increased consumption of our pdt segment products by our existing customers  as well as the addition of new customers 
we expect to be able to grow our pdt segment revenues in the united states during  primarily due to the percent increase in reimbursement of our pdt related procedure fee  which became effective january  we also expect our pdt revenues in canada to remain flat in largely due to the level of reimbursement to physicians in that country 
in addition  with the settlement of the river s edge litigation in  we expect moderate growth in our non pdt drug products revenues in  primarily due to our belief that existing quantities of nic in the distribution channel should be substantially depleted by the end of march and we should regain our market share beginning in the second quarter of our expectations for growth assume that there are no other products successfully introduced into the marketplace which would be substitutable for nicomide and that the fda does not take enforcement action against nicomide as a marketed unapproved drug 
we are pursuing an alternative labeling and distribution strategy that we believe we could deploy if the fda takes such action

kerastick gross margins for the year ended december  were  versus for the year ended december  the increase in margin is mainly attributable to an increase in our average unit selling price and lower overall manufacturing costs due to increased production volumes 
our long term goal is to achieve higher gross margins on kerastick sales which will be significantly dependent on increased volume

blu u margins for the year ended december  were  versus for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin is a result of an increase in the average selling price per unit as well as the impact of a one time sales promotion where we sold a limited number of earlier generation devices with zero cost basis

our costs related to this study will be limited to providing levulan  leasing lasers and the necessary training for the investigators involved 
all other costs of this study are the responsibility of the nci dcp 
although we expect the clinical trial on oral cavity dysplasia to commence in the first quarter of  the actual timing of the initiation is within the total control of nci so we cannot be certain of the initiation date 
we have options on any new intellectual property 

table of contents we have retained the services of a regulatory consultant to assist us with seeking foreign marketing approvals for our products  which will also cause research and development expenses to increase
