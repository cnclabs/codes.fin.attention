item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion of results of operations  liquidity and capital resources contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as described under the heading important information regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and in the section above entitled risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  all common stock related amounts have been adjusted to reflect our one for six reverse stock split effective september  critical accounting policies basis of revenue recognition to date  we do not have any significant ongoing revenue sources 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had net property and equipment of approximately million and a net intangible asset of approximately million  which represents capitalized payments for our picoplatin license 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we estimate the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on events or circumstances  such as changes in the company s business strategy and plans  a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in asset condition or a significant adverse change in regulatory climate 
specifically  the value of the picoplatin intangible asset could be impaired as a result of negative results of clinical trials or as a result of adverse decisions or rulings of regulatory bodies  such as the fda 
application of the test for impairment requires significant judgment  taking into account potentially unfavorable factors  such as those mentioned above  that could adversely affect the carrying value of the asset 
in june  we recognized an asset impairment loss of million on certain facilities and equipment resulting from the termination of our str program 
the loss on the equipment at the seattle facility was determined based on estimates of potential sales values of used equipment and other selling costs 
in december  we recognized an additional impairment loss of million on the str manufacturing facility in denton  texas  based on our evaluation of market data for this property  and classified this asset as a long term asset held for sale 
on october   we sold the denton facility  which resulted in net sales proceeds of million  with a net gain of million 
long term debt we assumed a note payable to texas state bank in connection with the acquisition of our str manufacturing facility in denton  texas 
in may  we paid off the million balance outstanding on the note 
in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital  which is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our non intellectual property assets 
under the loan agreement  we received capital loan proceeds of million on october  the loan term is months  with maturity on april  we are required to pay a fixed interest rate on the outstanding principal balance plus a million additional payment on the maturity date of the loan 
we are accreting this additional payment to the note payable balance over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and are reflecting the periodic accretion as additional interest expense 
the loan agreement also contains covenants requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash of  during the loan term and  not later than december   to provide evidence of positive phase ii data for the picoplatin drug development program and the commencement of enrollment of patients in a phase iii trial for picoplatin 
we provided evidence of satisfaction of this latter covenant in may and august of in connection with the loan agreement  we issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the portion of the loan proceeds allocable to the warrants is  based on their relative fair value  which we recorded as additional discount to notes payable 
we classify the portion of the loan that is due for payment in and thereafter as a long term payable 
stock compensation beginning january   we account for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options  however  have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options 
for example  employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
we use historical data  and other related information as appropriate  to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of a grant 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared with december  we had no revenue for and total operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the year ended december  the primary components of the increase in were higher clinical costs of million associated with our picoplatin trials  increased costs of million for other r d efforts and increased stock option expense of million 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in g a costs during was due primarily to increased stock option expense of million  increased personnel costs of million  increased facilities overhead costs of million  offset by decreased general legal costs of million 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest expense for was due primarily to the reduction in debt discount amortization of million  which was offset by an increase in bank notes interest expense of million 
the decrease in debt discount amortization resulted principally from our bridge financing  which accounted for debt discount amortization of million in and no amortization in interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over interest income for the year ended december  this was due to the income from the investment of excess cash from our public offering 
we received approximately million in net cash proceeds from a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share in april the public offering 
we plan to use these proceeds for the continued clinical and preclinical development of picoplatin  including funding our ongoing clinical trials in small cell lung cancer  metastatic colorectal cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer  for discovery and research for new products candidates  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and investment securities will provide adequate resources to fund operations at least through the second quarter of as a result of the completion of the public offering  our outstanding common stock increased from approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared with million at december  we currently are conducting multiple ongoing studies of picoplatin and initiated a phase iii pivotal study in april these  as well as increases in personnel and other plans for future growth  are expected to result in significant increases in our future operating costs  including research and development and administrative expenses 
we will require substantial additional funding to support our picoplatin and any other clinical development programs and to fund our operations 
in the event that we do not obtain sufficient additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce or curtail the scope of our picoplatin and other proposed development activities 
preferred dividends on series preferred stock were million in both and year ended december  compared with december  we had no revenue for  while our revenues for totaled  revenue for consisted primarily of royalty payments 
total operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in total operating expenses for the year ended december  included an asset impairment charge of million 
additionally  a restructuring charge of million was incurred in relating to termination benefits for the reduction in staff and other costs related to the termination of our str program 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the same period in the primary components of the increase in were higher clinical costs of million associated with our picoplatin trials and increased costs of million for other r d efforts  offset by decreased costs of million related to the termination of our str program and decreased costs of million related to our patent portfolio maintenance 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase in g a costs was due primarily to million of stock option expense recorded in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard r and million of expense related to special shareholder meetings 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to interest expense of million for the same period in the million increase in interest expense for was due primarily to the amortization of debt discount in the amount of million related to the bridge financing and million related to the silicon valley bank loan  which transactions are discussed below 
the increase in interest income of million for compared to is due to the income from the investment of excess cash from our equity financing 
we received approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in april the equity financing 
in connection with the financing  we issued to a group of institutional and other accredited investors an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a cash purchase price of per share 
investors in the financing also received five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as part of the equity financing  we received a million bridge loan in february from investors in the equity financing 
pursuant the bridge loan  we issued five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we used the funds received in the bridge financing for working capital pending receipt of required shareholder approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to completion of the equity financing 
the outstanding principal amount of the bridge notes issued to the investors  together with  of accrued interest  automatically converted  at a conversion price of per share  into  shares of common stock at the closing of the equity financing 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million  compared with million at december  preferred dividends on series preferred stock were million in both and major research and development programs our major research and development program during the fiscal years ended december  and was picoplatin  a new generation platinum based cancer therapy 
our major research and development program during the fiscal year ended december  was skeletal targeted radiotherapy  or str  a bone targeting radiotherapeutic 
in may  we discontinued our str program and refocused our resources on the development of picoplatin 
this restructuring included terminating patient enrollment in our phase iii trial of str in multiple myeloma  ceasing operations at our denton facility  where str was manufactured  and reducing our workforce by approximately 
picoplatin program 
picoplatin is a new generation platinum based chemotherapeutic designed to overcome platinum resistance in the treatment of solid tumors 
we completed patient enrollment in our phase ii clinical study of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer in august and  based on positive median overall survival data from that ongoing study  we initiated a phase iii pivotal trial of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer in april in may  we treated our first patients in separate phase i ii studies evaluating picoplatin as a first line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer 
we initiated the phase ii component of our prostate cancer study in july and completed enrollment in december we initiated enrollment in the phase ii component of our colorectal cancer study in november in april  we initiated a phase i study of an oral formulation of picoplatin in advanced solid tumors 
as of december   we have incurred external costs of approximately million in connection with our entire picoplatin clinical program 
total estimated future costs of our picoplatin phase ii and phase iii trials in small cell lung cancer are in the ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively  through  including the cost of drug supply 
total estimated future costs of our picoplatin phase ii trial in colorectal cancer and our phase ii trial in hormone refractory prostate cancer are in the ranges of million to million and million to million  respectively  through  including the cost of drug supply 
total estimated future costs of our phase i trial in oral picoplatin are in the range of million to million through  including the cost of drug supply 
these costs could be substantially higher if we have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of any of our trials 
material cash inflows relating to our picoplatin development will not commence unless and until we complete required clinical trials and obtain fda marketing approvals  and then only if picoplatin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of picoplatin 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of picoplatin on schedule  or at all  include the following  as well as the other risks and uncertainties described in this report we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of picoplatin  we may be unable to secure adequate supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product in order to complete our clinical trials  picoplatin may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials  and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals of the drug or may be unable to obtain such approvals on a timely basis 
if we fail to obtain marketing approvals for picoplatin  are unable to secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product  or do not complete development and obtain united states and foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  our operations  financial position and liquidity could be severely impaired  including as follows we would not earn any sales revenue from picoplatin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other research and development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which could make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms  or at all 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict the period in which material cash inflows from our picoplatin program will commence  if ever 
discontinued str program 
str is a radiotherapeutic designed to deliver radiation specifically to sites of cancer in the bone and bone marrow 
from inception of our str development program in until its discontinuation in may  we incurred total str program costs of approximately million 
total estimated costs to complete our str phase iii clinical trial and potentially obtain marketing approval were in the range of million to million  including cost of clinical drug supply 
these costs would have been substantially higher if we were required to repeat  revise or expand the scope of our trials or conduct additional clinical trials 
discontinuation of our str development program relieved us of the annual costs associated with the program  including manufacturing  clinical trial and personnel costs 
during and  these costs were approximately million and million  respectively 
in october  we sold the denton manufacturing facility 
str was a clinical stage product for which no marketing approvals had been obtained 
we had no material cash inflows relating to str development and did not receive any revenues from product sales of str 
due to our decision to curtail our str development program  there is neither an anticipated completion date nor an expected period during which material cash inflows will commence 
as a consequence of the restructuring  we are not dependent on the successful development and completion of our str program 
summary of research and development costs 
our development administration overhead costs  consisting of rent  utilities  consulting fees  patent costs and other various overhead costs  are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
our total research and development costs include the costs of various research efforts directed toward the identification and evaluation of future product candidates 
these other research projects are preclinical and not considered major projects 
our total research and development costs are summarized below summary of research and development costs in thousands picoplatin    discontinued programs  other overhead and research costs    total research and development costs    liquidity and capital resources we have historically experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had net working capital of million  an accumulated deficit of million and total shareholders equity of million 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  technology licensing  collaborative agreements and debt instruments 
we invest excess cash in investment securities that will be used to fund future operating costs 
cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
there were no revenues and other income sources for the year ended december  cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  net of restricted cash of million  totaled million at december  compared to million at december  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investment securities will provide adequate resources to fund operations at least through the second quarter of on april   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds of the public offering  after payment of underwriters discounts and commissions and offering expenses  were million 
we plan to use these proceeds for the continued clinical and preclinical development of picoplatin  including funding our ongoing clinical trials in small cell lung cancer  metastatic colorectal cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer  for discovery and research for new product candidates  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
as a result of the completion of the public offering  our outstanding common stock increased from approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
on april   we completed an equity financing  pursuant to which we issued to a group of institutional and other accredited investors an aggregate of million shares of common stock at a cash purchase price of per share 
investors in the equity financing also received five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we received million in net proceeds from the equity financing  which  along with the net proceed received from our april public offering  we intend to use to fund our picoplatin clinical program and general working capital needs 
concurrent with the closing of the equity financing  we issued an aggregate of million shares of common stock to the holders of our series b preferred stock upon conversion of their outstanding series b preferred shares 
in connection with our equity financing  we entered into a letter agreement with texas state bank  pursuant to which we agreed to accelerate the maturity date of our promissory note with the bank to june  the texas state bank note  which was secured by our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing plant and other str assets located in denton  texas  had an adjustable interest rate equal to the bank prime rate reported in the wall street journal at may  
we paid off the outstanding balance of the note  million  on may  on october   we sold the denton property  which resulted in net sales proceeds of million  with a net gain of  on october   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital  pursuant to which we obtained a million capital loan 
we have used million of the proceeds of the loan to fund our cash payment obligations to genzyme under the license agreement amendment and plan to use the remaining proceeds to support our late stage clinical trials of picoplatin and general working capital needs 
the loan is for a term of months and matures on april  we are required to pay a fixed interest rate on the outstanding principal balance plus a million additional payment upon the maturity date of the loan 
we are accreting this additional payment to the note payable balance over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and are reflecting the periodic accretion as additional interest expense 
all interest payable under the loan agreement and the full amount of the additional payment must be paid upon any prepayment of the loan 
the loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our non intellectual property assets 
the loan agreement contains restrictions on our ability to  among other things  dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisition transactions  incur indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments and pay dividends or repurchase stock 
the loan agreement also contains covenants requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash of million during the loan term and  not later than december   to provide evidence of positive phase ii data for the picoplatin drug development program and commence enrollment of patients in a phase iii trial for picoplatin 
we provided evidence of satisfaction of this latter covenant in may and august of the loan contains events of default that include  among other things  nonpayment of principal and interest or fees  breaches of covenants  material adverse changes  bankruptcy and insolvency events  cross defaults to other indebtedness  material judgments  inaccuracy of representations and warranties and events constituting a change of control 
the occurrence of an event of default would increase the applicable rate of interest by and could result in acceleration of our payment obligations under the loan agreement 
we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco in september we intend to maintain our current clinical and development and support activities in seattle 
the addition of  square feet of office and laboratory space leased in the south san francisco facility resulted in a substantial increase in our rent and operating costs 
under the lease agreement dated july   the annual base rent for the leased facilities is approximately  and is subject to annual adjustment based on increases in the consumer price index in the san francisco metropolitan market cpi sfmm and a one time adjustment for reimbursement for tenant improvements 
monthly base rent was increased by  to  following the adjustment for the cpi sfmm 
in december  we received approximately  as a tenant reimbursement that resulted in a further  increase in monthly base rent to  additional rent is payable monthly based on our share of operating expenses of the project in which the leased facilities are located  as described in the lease agreement 
monthly base rent during the first seven months of the lease averaged  during the construction of tenant improvements 
we paid total rent base rent and additional rent based on our share of project operating expenses of approximately  during the initial term of the lease is months 
we may  upon written notice delivered at least nine months prior to expiration of the initial lease term  extend the lease for an additional three years  with rent payable at the then market rate 
in april  we acquired the worldwide exclusive rights  excluding japan  to develop  manufacture and commercialize picoplatin from anormed  inc anormed was acquired by genzyme corporation in november under the terms of the original agreement  we paid a one time upfront payment of million in common stock and million in cash 
the original agreement provided for development and commercialization milestone payments of up to million  payable in cash or a combination of cash and common stock  and a royalty rate of up to of net product sales after regulatory approval 
the parties executed an amendment to the license agreement on september   modifying several key financial terms and expanding the licensed territory to include japan  thereby providing us worldwide rights 
in consideration of the amendment  we paid genzyme million in cash on october  and million in cash on march  the amendment eliminated million in development milestone payments to genzyme 
genzyme remains entitled to receive up to million in commercialization milestones upon the attainment of certain levels of annual net sales of picoplatin after regulatory approval 
the amendment also reduced the royalty payable to genzyme to a maximum of of annual net product sales 
in addition  the amendment eliminated the sharing of sublicense revenues on and after september  on august   we entered into a research funding and option agreement with the scripps research institute  or tsri 
under the agreement  as amended  we committed to provide tsri an aggregate of million over a month period to fund research relating to synthesis and evaluation of novel small molecule  multi targeted protein kinase inhibitors and focal adhesion kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents  including the treatment of cancer 
we have the option to negotiate a worldwide exclusive license  including the right to sublicense  to develop and to commercialize any compounds arising from the collaboration 
the research funding was payable by us to tsri quarterly in accordance with the agreed upon research plan and budget 
on august   we made an initial funding payment to tsri of approximately million 
we paid tsri total funding payments of approximately million in and approximately million in  all of which amounts were charged to r d expense 
we completed our funding commitment to tsri under the research funding agreement  which ended december   and have reserved our option rights under the agreement 
we have no assurance that the research funded under this arrangement will be successful or ultimately will give rise to any viable product candidates 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate  on acceptable terms  a license with respect to any compounds arising from the collaboration 
we will require substantial additional funding to develop and commercialize picoplatin and any other proposed products and to fund our operations 
management is continuously exploring financing alternatives  including raising additional capital through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities or through the establishment of credit or other funding facilities  and entering into strategic collaborations  which may include joint ventures or partnerships for product development and commercialization  merger  sale of assets or other similar transactions 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the scope and timing of our picoplatin clinical program and other research and development efforts  including the progress and costs of our ongoing phase ii and phase iii trials of picoplatin in small cell lung cancer  our ongoing phase ii trials in colorectal and prostate cancers  as well as our phase i trial of picoplatin oral formulation in solid tumors  our ability to obtain clinical supplies of picoplatin active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product in a timely and cost effective manner  actions taken by the fda and other regulatory authorities  the timing and amount of any milestone or other payments we might receive from potential strategic partners  our degree of success in commercializing picoplatin or any other product candidates  the emergence of competing technologies and products  and other adverse market developments  the acquisition or in licensing of other products or intellectual property  the costs of incurred in connection with the planned expansion of our workforce  the costs of any research collaborations or strategic partnerships established  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs of performing our obligations under the loan with silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital  including the cost of interest and other payment obligations and penalties and the cost of complying with unrestricted cash and other covenants and restrictions under the loan agreement 
during  we experienced significant changes to our capital structure which resulted in an ownership change  as defined under section of the irc 
consequently  the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in future years are limited under irc sections and this limitation resulted in the loss of approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards and million of our research and development credit carryforwards 
we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available for future use as of december   which will expire from through although the public offering completed on april  resulted in a significant change in the company s capital structure  we have determined that an ownership change did not occur as defined in section of the irc 
consequently  the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research and experimentation carryforwards available for use in future years will not be further limited under irc sections and as a result of that public offering 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or enter into relationships with corporate partners on a timely basis  on favorable terms  or at all 
conditions in the capital markets in general  and in the life science capital market specifically  may affect our potential financing sources and opportunities for strategic partnering 
our financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis  however  our inability to obtain additional cash as needed could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and our ability to continue in existence 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations notes payable    operating lease obligations seattle premises south san francisco premises   capital lease obligations equipment capital lease total    lease executed in july see discussion above for details

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the debt securities included in its investment portfolio 
the company does not invest in any derivative financial instruments 
the company invests in money market funds  debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may experience losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company owned no government debt instruments and owned corporate debt securities totaling million 
the company s exposure to losses as a result of interest rate changes is managed through investing primarily in securities with relatively short maturities of two years or less and in securities with variable interest rates 
all of the corporate debt securities owned by the company at december  had maturities of less than one year 
the company s only material outstanding debt is its loan obligation to silicon valley bank and merrill lynch capital 
the outstanding balance of this loan was million on december  the loan  which matures on april   bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the occurrence of an event of default under the loan  as described above  would increase the applicable rate of interest by during the continuance of the event of default and could result in acceleration of the company s payment obligations under the loan agreement 
investment risk in the past  the company has received equity instruments under licensing agreements 
these instruments  when received  are included in investment securities and are accounted for at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive loss and classified as accumulated other comprehensive income unrealized gain on investment securities in shareholders equity 
such investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
at december  and  the company owned no corporate equity securities
