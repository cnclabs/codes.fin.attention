item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our current focus is to develop and employ innovative technology to produce synthetic liquid hydrocarbons that are substantially free of contaminants normally found in conventional hydrocarbon products 
our bio synfining technology processes triglycerides and or fatty acids from fats and vegetable oils with heat thermal depolymerization  hydrogen and proprietary catalysts to make renewable synthetic fuels  such as diesel  jet fuel subject to certification  kerosene  naphtha and propane 
syntroleum has quantified in excess of different fats and oils  which cover the spectrum of both cost and quality  for conversion to synthetic fuels via the bio synfining technology 
our operations to date have consisted of the research and development of the syntroleum process designed to convert natural gas into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons  gtl  and activities related to the commercialization of the syntroleum process 
synthetic liquid hydrocarbons produced by the syntroleum process can be further processed using the syntroleum synfining process into high quality liquid fuels 
our bio synfining technology is a renewable fuels application of our synfining product upgrading technology 
the company is also applying its technology to convert synthesis gas derived from coal  ctl  or bio feedstocks  btl  into these same high quality products 
the company is centered on being a recognized provider of the bio synfining technology  syntroleum process and synfining product upgrading technology to the energy industry through strategic relationships and licensing of its technology 
operating revenues during the periods discussed below  our revenues were primarily generated from licensing revenue from marathon  reimbursement for research and development activities associated with the syntroleum process and sales of products for testing purposes 
we have also received revenues for engineering services rendered for the process design package for dynamic 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from sales of engineering technical services  products or fees or royalties for the use of gtl  btl and ctl plants in which we will own an equity interest  demonstration plant product sales  licensing and royalty fees and the sale of catalyst 
until the commencement of commercial operation of our dynamic fuels facility located in geismar  louisiana or until commercial operation of another gtl  btl or ctl plant in which we own an interest  we expect that cash flow relating to the synfining process or syntroleum process will consist primarily of revenues associated with technical services provided by our engineers 
upon commercial operations of our dynamic facility we will receive royalty fees based on the production of the facility 
commercial operations are expected to begin in the second half of we expect to receive additional profits from the operations of the facility based on our proportionate equity ownership of the plant 
we will not receive additional license fees until we enter into additional license agreements or existing licensees develop commercial plants 
our future operating revenues and investments in projects will depend on the successful commercial construction and operation of the dynamic fuels facility or other gtl  btl or ctl plants based on the syntroleum process  the success of competing gtl technologies  and other competing uses for natural gas  biomass or coal 
we expect our results of operations and cash flows to be affected by changing crude oil  natural gas  oils  animal fats  fuel and specialty product prices and trends in environmental regulations 
if the price of these products increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in operating revenues 
we continue to incur substantial operating expenses with respect to commercializing the syntroleum process and the bio synfining and synfining process and do not anticipate recognizing any significant revenues or investments in projects from production from our bio synfining facility until we do not anticipate recognizing any significant revenues or investments in projects from production from either a gtl  btl or ctl fuel or specialty plant or from licensing our technology in the near future 
as a result  we expect to continue to operate at a loss until sufficient revenues are recognized from licensing activities or commercial operations of the bio synfining facility or the commercial operations of gtl  btl and ctl plants 
operating expenses our operating expenses historically have consisted primarily of the construction and operation of the catoosa demonstration facility  pilot plant  engineering  including third party engineering  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses  which include costs associated with general corporate overhead  compensation expense  legal and accounting expenses and expenses associated with other related administrative functions 

table of contents we have also recognized depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to office and computer equipment  buildings and leasehold improvements and patents 
we have incurred significant costs and expenses over the last several years as we have expanded our research and development  engineering and commercial activities 
in the third quarter of with the completion of our research and development efforts related to running the cdf and pilot plant  operating costs declined as a result of suspending operations at both plants  reducing our workforce and focusing on cost minimization 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed all other research and development activities  including all laboratory work 
we once again reduced our work force and focused on cost minimization 
our current workforce has decreased by employees during to employees as of december  these employees include research and development employees and general and administrative employees 
we anticipate these cost saving measures implemented in the fourth quarter of and in to have a significant favorable impact on operating expenses on a go forward basis 
we do not expect to rehire any of the employees included in the reductions if we accelerate the development of a commercial project 
we paid in full a significant portion of the severance payments related to our staff reduction by the end of we plan to continue to monitor our expenditures with regards to general and administrative expense throughout as well 
our operating expenses are not expected to increase further within the near future 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development and design of the bio synfining and syntroleum process 
these costs  which relate primarily to engineers  outside contract services for initial engineering  design  and development are included in engineering costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
if we are successful in developing a bio synfining plant in which we own an interest  we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our share of the engineering design  construction and start up of the plant 
these expenses are expected to be million for the dynamic facility 
upon the commencement of commercial operations of a plant  we will incur our share of cost of sales expenses relating primarily to the cost of feedstocks for the plant and operating expenses relating to the plant  including labor  consumables and product marketing costs 
due to the substantial capital expenditures associated with the construction of a bio synfining plant  we expect the plant will incur significant depreciation and amortization expense in the future 
discontinued operations research and development our policy is to expense costs associated with the catoosa demonstration facility and pilot plant  and research and development costs as incurred in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
all of these research and development expenses were associated with the development of our syntroleum process 
the catoosa demonstration facility expenses include costs to construct  maintain  and operate the facility for further research and development as well as for demonstrations for licensees and other customers 
research and development expenses include costs to operate our laboratory and technology center  salaries and wages associated with these operations  research and development services performed by universities  consultants and third parties and additional supplies and equipment for these facilities 
our policy is to expense costs associated with the development of gtl plants or other projects until we begin our front end engineering and design program on the respective projects 
we also capitalize any costs associated with a project that would have economic value for future projects 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development of the syntroleum process 
we commenced operations at the catoosa demonstration facility in the first quarter of  with production of the initial finished fuels occurring on march  we have produced all of our contractual commitments to the doe and have delivered all of the required fuels to a fuels testing facility in detroit  michigan  denali national park in alaska  the university of alaska in fairbanks and the washington dc area metropolitan transit authority 
in september  the company completed the production of our contract committed volume of fuels to the united states department of defense 
in addition  we also successfully completed the longest run of our catalyst testing activity at the tulsa pilot plant 
we suspended operations at both facilities 
our laboratory facilities have performed analysis on all of our finished products produced from our demonstration facilities as well have quantified over types of animal fat  greases and oils as feedstock for our bio synfining process 
these facilities have also enhanced our catalyst through continued testing 
based on these activities we believe our diesel fuel produced from the ft and bio synfining processes is inherently cleaner with many benefits over diesel refined from petroleum 
as our technology is complete and documented  we have suspended operations at our laboratory facilities and have disposed of these facilities in all revenues and costs associated with these activities such as facilities  overhead associated with the facilities  personnel  equipment and outside testing and analytical work have been reported in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
the total cost of research and development activities  including the operation and construction of the catoosa demonstration facility totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively 
joint development revenues with licensees and the us government have been reported in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
other costs associated with the construction of the catoosa demonstration facility include the funding provided by marathon are also included in discontinued operations  this includes interest expense and gain on extinguishment of debt 

table of contents we have also reported our technology center as property and equipment held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we sold this facility in march we have impaired the building to the agreed upon price less closing transaction costs resulting in a  impairment expense for the year ended december  international oil and gas our international oil and gas activities have primarily included the leasehold acquisition  geological and geophysical work covering various areas in nigeria  and drilling costs for the aje discovery well aje in oil mining lease oml offshore nigeria 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our international oil and gas activities due to limited access to capital requirements 
we sold all the stock of various subsidiaries  including syntroleum nigeria limited which held our interests in the ajapa and aje fields offshore nigeria to african energy equity resources limited aeerl  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of energy equity resources norway limited eernl 
the sale was effectuated through a sale share and purchase agreement which was entered into pursuant to a letter of intent dated november  as consideration for the sale  aeerl paid us a million nonrefundable deposit on december  aeerl was to pay us  on the earlier to occur of april  or the date aeerl raised additional capital  million from the first gross revenues aeerl receives from each of the ajapa and aje interests neither well currently producing  and million if third party farmees enter into an agreement to fund at least half of the cost of drilling the proposed aje well

based on the million proceeds received and the million receivable as of december   we recognized a gain on the sale of these entities for the year ended december  of  which is reflected in gain loss on discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  certain other costs associated with the closing of the entity have been incurred and is netted against the total gain in the consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining receivable due of  plus accrued interest was received on march  we recognized depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  based on impairment evaluation under the full cost method of accounting 
the fair value of the international oil and gas assets was determined using the full cost ceiling test 
as of december   the receivable of  was classified as current assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet and all significant obligations associated with the international oil and gas operations have been fulfilled and no liabilities are recorded 
the international oil and gas assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale as of december  net international oil and gas properties classified as held for sale is  as of december  we incurred interest expense of approximately in   in and  in related to the amortization of the debt issuance costs related to the stranded gas venture 
the purpose of the stranded gas venture was to fund oil and gas upstream activities 
we included these costs in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
domestic oil and gas we were pursuing gas monetization projects in which we were directly involved in gas field development using available gas processing technologies from third parties 
we completed an evaluation of potential reserves related to drilled properties in the united states and decided to discontinue further expenditures in the central kansas uplift area based on the results of this evaluation 
we recorded depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense of  related to these properties and the associated gas processing plant and equipment during the year ended december  we sold certain leasehold acres during for  the remaining leasehold acreage  including the wells and equipment  sold for  in january we have actively sought prospects for sale of our gas processing plant and related equipment and completed the sale in in the amount of  net domestic oil and gas properties and equipment classified as held for sale is and  for the year ended december  and  respectively and the results of operations of the domestic oil and gas segment are presented as discontinued operations in the financial statements for the years ended december   and in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents significant developments during commercial and licensee projects on june   we entered into definitive agreements with tyson foods  inc tyson to form a joint venture limited liability company  dynamic fuels  llc  a delaware limited liability company dynamic  to construct facilities in the united states using our bio synfining technology 
the purpose of dynamic is to construct multiple stand alone commercial plants in the united states 
the first facility will be located in geismar  louisiana and produce approximately million gallons per year of renewable synthetic fuels from million pounds per year of feedstock beginning in total project cost is currently estimated to be approximately million  of which million is for the plant itself  million working capital and million in engineering and project development costs 
million has been committed and funded prorata by tyson and syntroleum 
we secured a million capital commitment in november as part of our initial funding efforts 
we expect to seek additional available financing through debt financing  project financing  alternative financing and or financing through the capital markets 
tyson is responsible for supplying feedstock to the plant  which can range from high quality canola or soy vegetable oils to fats and greases  either from its own internal sources or from supplies it procures in the open market 
the feedstock supply agreement provides a pricing formula for the feedstock  which is generally equivalent to the market price for the feedstocks 
the tyson fat blend feedstock is expected to provide us with a notable cost advantage compared to users of soybean oil feedstock 
the feedstock slate will be subject to change based upon market availability and other factors 
we currently expect that the first facility will produce approximately diesel  naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases based on annual gallons of feedstock  although actual production will depend upon market conditions and other factors 
we expect that dynamic will be eligible for a federal excise tax credit of per gallon for diesel produced and 
per gallon for naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases produced 
based upon current pricing of the feedstock slate expected to be delivered by tyson and the natural gas used in the bio synfining process and our expectations regarding other operating costs  we expect unit costs on a per gallon basis for the initial bio synfining plant  if it were operating today  to be feedstock costs of approximately per gallon and operating costs excluding depreciation of per gallon of feedstock 
actual costs will vary according to changes in feedstock and other resources  the performance of the plant  plant operating conditions  cost variations in the components of operating costs and other factors  and are likely to fluctuate substantially from these indicative amounts 
dynamic is organized and operated pursuant to the provisions of its limited liability company agreement between the company and tyson the llc agreement 
the llc agreement provides for management and control of dynamic to be exercised jointly by representatives of the company and tyson equally with no llc member exercising control 
it was initially capitalized on july  with million in capital contributions from tyson and million in capital contributions from syntroleum 
our capital contribution was made from proceeds of a common stock offering which was funded on july  this initial capital contribution was used in part to evaluate potential sites and to complete the process design package by our engineering staff 
as an incentive for entering into a joint venture limited liability company agreement  which formed dynamic  in connection with a transaction with tyson involving our bio synfining technology and the risk associated with the initial commercial deployment of its technology  tyson received warrants to buy our common stock 
the warrants are allocated in three tranches 
the first tranche of million shares was awarded upon signing of the llc agreement  feedstock and master license agreements in june the warrant agreement provides that the second tranche of million shares will be issued upon sanctioning of the second plant and the third tranche of million shares will be issued upon sanctioning of the third plant  provided that tyson has at least a interest in dynamic 
the exercise price of the first tranche of million warrants is per share  which was the ten day average closing price prior to the signing of the above referenced agreements on june  the exercise price of the second and third tranches of warrants will be the ten day average closing price prior to the sanctioning of plants or vesting requires that tyson remain at least a equity owner in dynamic in the case of the first tranche and in the applicable plant in the case of the second and third tranches  and that each plant has commenced commercial operation 
maturity of each tranche of warrants will be on the third anniversary of each respective plant s start up date of commercial operations 
if or more of the project cost for the third plant is debt financed  then the third warrant tranche will not vest 
in the event that tyson owns a or greater interest in dynamic the number of shares subject to the second and third warrant tranche doubles subject to a limitation that tyson will not receive pursuant to all tranches warrants for stock equal to or more than of the outstanding shares of syntroleum common stock 
in the event tyson defaults by not paying its capital contributions to the plant  tyson loses the warrants for such plant 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we have granted tyson demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the warrants 

table of contents demonstration activities doe catoosa project 
the doe awarded a contract in to integrated concepts and research corporation to provide funding for the doe ultra clean transportation fuels project for which we provided the ultra clean fuels doe catoosa project 
in may  we signed a participation agreement with marathon in connection with this project that included the relocation of certain modules from our cherry point gtl facility at arco s refinery in washington state to the tulsa port of catoosa near tulsa  oklahoma 
these modules formed the basis of our catoosa demonstration facility  a demonstration facility designed to produce up to approximately b d of synthetic products and demonstrate commercial scale up of the syntroleum and synfining processes 
the facility was mechanically completed and dedicated on october   and we achieved startup and commenced fuel deliveries in the first quarter of the fuels from this facility were tested by others in advanced power train and emission control technologies  and the fuels were also tested in bus fleets by the washington metropolitan area transit authority and the us national park service at denali national park in alaska 
outside the scope of the doe catoosa project and at our own cost  we installed additional facilities at the catoosa demonstration facility for the purpose of further demonstrating our technology and operational capabilities 
since this project is not for commercial operations  the costs associated with it have been expensed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
the project has been funded by us and the other project participants  including million from the doe for the relocation  engineering  and re installation of the cherry point equipment  labor and cash contributions of million by marathon  and million from us provided by a loan agreement between marathon and us

this marked the commencement of the dod s larger program aimed at long term in flight evaluation of ft aviation fuel  and their examination of the prospects for the domestic manufacture and supply of synthetic aviation fuels from ft plants 
we completed production and shipment of approximately  gallons of our ft aviation fuel commitment in early september on september   our ultra clean iso paraffinic kerosene jet fuel was successfully tested in a united states air force b stratofortress bomber aircraft 
the plane lifted off from edwards air force base with a blend of our ft jet fuel and traditional jp jet fuel which was burned in two of the eight engines on the plane 
this marks the first time that ft jet fuel has been tested in a military flight demo  and is the first of several planned test flights 
a second successful flight test was performed on december  at edwards air force base in california 
this test used a blend of our jet fuel and conventional jp in all eight engines 
this marks the first time that a b has flown using a synfuel blend as the only fuel on board 
we recognized approximately  in revenue from the sale of jet fuel and labor associated with this contract 
following on the success of our delivery to the department of defense of the syntroleum s aviation grade ft research fluid  we signed a further contract in june to produce an initial gallons of aviation grade renewable research fluid syntroleum r  a product of bio synfining for analysis by the same group in the department of defense that previously tested syntroleum s we expect that the syntroleum r produced by our bio synfining technology will exhibit substantially similar properties to our syntroleum s produced by our synfining process under comparative analysis of the two products 
if successful  we anticipate further requests for evaluation of syntroleum r produced by our bio synfining technology as interest grows in renewable sources of aviation fuel and the prospect for the domestic manufacture and supply of such fuel 
we recognized approximately  in revenue from the sale and labor associated with this contract for the year ended december

we have an effective registration statement for proposed offerings from time to time of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depository shares or warrants for a remaining aggregate offering price of approximately million as of december  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement on november  which provides for the purchase of common stock up to million over the twenty four months of the agreement  of which million and million were drawn down on march  and july   respectively 
of the million draw down on july   million was used to capitalize dynamic 
no draw downs can be made under this facility when our stock price is less than per share 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval and the terms of the preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available 
on january  we received from the nasdaq stock market a letter indicating that we were not in compliance with the market value minimum requirement for its common stock as set forth in marketplace rule b a 
we were provided calendar days  or until february   to regain compliance 
we were unable to meet this requirement and have requested a hearing to appeal the delisting determination to a listing qualifications panel 
pending this decision  we may apply to transfer our common stock to the nasdaq capital market if it satisfies the requirements for continued listing 
we also received a nasdaq staff deficiency letter on february   indicating our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion under marketplace rule a 
we are provided calendar days  or until july   to regain compliance 
during this day period  our shares will continue to trade on the nasdaq stock market assuming our stock is not de listed for failure to comply with the market value minimum requirement described above 
the nasdaq stock market has indicated that if at any time before july   the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive business days  the staff will determine if we have achieved compliance with the rule 
we are currently exploring alternatives for raising capital to commercialize the growth of our businesses  including the formation of joint ventures and other strategic alliances 
if adequate funds are not available  or if we are not successful in establishing a strategic alliance  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate expenditures for our plant development and other activities or may seek to enter into a business combination transaction with or sell assets to another company 
we could also be forced to license to third parties the rights to commercialize additional products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the transactions we outlined above may not be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
assuming the commercial success of the plants based on the syntroleum process  we expect that license fees  catalyst sales and sales of products from plants in which we own an interest will be a source of revenues 
in addition  we could receive revenues from other commercial projects we are pursuing 
however  we may not receive any of these revenues  and these revenues may not be sufficient for capital expenditures or operations and may not be received within the expected time frame 
if we are unable to generate funds from operations  our need to obtain funds through financing activities will be increased 
we have sought and intend to continue to temporarily invest our assets  pending their use  so as to avoid becoming subject to the registration requirements of the investment company act of these investments are likely to result in lower yields on the funds invested than might be available in the securities market generally 
if we were required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  we would become subject to substantial regulation that could materially and adversely affect us 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years capital finance lease obligations operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations total

current requirements for capital are million  of which million is for the plant itself million working capital and million in engineering support and project development costs 
million has been funded prorata by tyson and syntroleum 
our next capital contribution obligation to the plant is estimated to be approximately million 
if either party elects not to proceed with the construction of the first plant  then their interest reverts to the other party  who is then free to build the plant 
if a member fails to make a capital contribution  it is in default  and its interest is diluted by per not contributed 
the other member s can make a loan to the defaulting member at a rate of libor and there is a day cure period 
the defaulting member can make a full or partial loan repayment and a pro rata portion of lost interest will be restored 
if the loan is not repaid  it will be converted into ownership interest for the member making the loan  diluting the defaulting member at the same rate of per of the loan 
we have secured a million capital commitment in november as part of our initial funding efforts 
this commitment is subject to various conditions  including that our stock remain listed on the nasdaq global market which is in doubt by reason of failure to meet certain continued listing criteria 
we can not make assurances that will be able to secure all of the necessary financial resources 
we expect to seek additional available financing through debt financing  project financing  alternative financing and or financing through the capital markets 
we are also in discussions with various parties regarding joint venture projects 
if these discussions progress  we could enter into additional commercial commitments 
these discussions currently relate to projects to be located in the united states and various other countries

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe that the following items represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from technical services provided as time and expenses for services or support associated with a contract or license are incurred 
the license agreements require us to develop a site specific plant design in accordance with licensee specifications  this design package is called the process design package  or pdp  and allows for a percent cost recovery of services rendered 
technical service revenues resulted from the preparation of our process design package to dynamic in the preparation of our process design package includes engineering labor and necessary materials for completion of the package 
we have conducted research and development activities in order to improve the conversion efficiency and reduce the capital and operating costs of gtl and ctl plants based on the syntroleum process 
we have received joint development revenues primarily through two initiatives prospect assessment and feasibility studies and formal joint development arrangements with our licensees and others 
through these joint development arrangements  we have received revenue as reimbursement for specified portions of our research and development or engineering expenses 
under some of these agreements  the joint development participant may receive credits against future license fees for monies expended on joint research and development 
during the periods presented  joint development revenues consisted primarily of amounts received from the doe and dod 
these projects required us to deliver results from development activities such as non proprietary analysis of plant processes  flow diagrams  chemical analysis and fuel production plans that were jointly shared by each party 

table of contents the customers benefit from paying for these development activities as they are obtaining access to information pertaining to the syntroleum process 
revenue is recognized when final delivery of the shared technology has occurred 
under some of these agreements  the joint development participant may receive credits against future license fees for monies expended on joint development 
the value of these credits is a fixed amount stated in the contract and reflected as deferred revenue until the credit is utilized 
the revenues recognized in the future from these contracts are deemed to be fixed and determinable under the criteria specified in staff accounting bulletin  topic and sop  software revenue recognition 
to date  our revenues and costs have been related to certain projects and are wholly dependent upon the nature of our projects 
the various sizes and timing of these projects  including the demonstration plant the catoosa demonstration facility used as part of the doe ultra clean fuels production and demonstration project with marathon affect the comparability of the periods presented 
license fee deposits received as cash upon the sale of master volume or regional license agreements are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize revenue on the sale of license agreements by recording percent of the license fee deposit as revenue when a site license agreement has been formally executed  the license fee deposit has been paid in cash and we have delivered to the licensee the process design package for the licensee s initial licensed plant 
since percent of the license fee deposit is subject to the our indemnity obligation with respect to the performance guarantee on the related plant  the remaining license fee deposit will be recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations after the related plant has passed certain performance tests 
option fees  which provide licensees the right to include additional geographic areas in its license agreement territory  are deferred until the earlier of the option being exercised or lapsing 
we are under no obligation to return these deferred revenues except in the case when a licensee builds a plant and the plant does not pass certain performance tests 
in this situation  the licensee would be able to receive a refund of percent of the license fees paid 
the license agreements have a year life and  after this time  the deferred revenue will be recorded as license revenue in the statements of operations unless a site license has been executed 
our current licenses generally begin to expire in and the initial deposits will be recognized as licensing revenue as the licenses expire should a licensee not purchase a site license and begin construction of a plant prior to expiration of the license 
we provide synthetic ultra clean diesel fuel  such as our s diesel fuel and s jet fuel subject to certification  produced from natural gas and fc naphtha fuels to various customers for their use in further research and testing upon their request 
the ultra clean s diesel fuel and s jet fuel subject to certification is a paraffinic  high cetane distillate fuel that is essentially free of sulfur  olefins  metals  aromatics or alcohols 
the fuels have been produced at the catoosa demonstration facility 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of the requested fuels and are recorded as other revenue 
research and development 
we have incurred significant costs for research and development programs 
expenses classified as research and development include salaries and wages  rent  utilities  equipment  engineering and outside testing and analytical work associated with our research  development and engineering programs 
since these costs are for research and development purposes  and not commercial or revenue producing  they are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
these costs are reported in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
these costs have been classified as discontinued operations in as we have completed the necessary research and development and intend to commercialize the technology 
significant cash flows will not be associated with these activities in the future 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with the accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment  which requires that we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  the financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  all outstanding deferred compensation at the time of adoption was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
for the year ended december   we recorded a total of  or per basic and diluted share of share based compensation expense 
at january   we had no cumulative effect associated with adopting sfas r 
non employee stock based compensation 
the company also grants stock based incentives to certain non employees 
these stock based incentives are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task forces issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
any stock options granted to non employees that are not related to specific performance criteria are expensed over the period of vesting 
stock options that are tied to performance criteria are expensed at the time the performance goals are met 

table of contents oil and gas properties 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for exploration  development  and acquisition of gas and oil reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive including salaries  benefits  and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
we exclude all costs of unevaluated properties from immediate amortization 
our unamortized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the sum of the future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of any unproved properties 
if our unamortized costs in oil and gas properties exceed this ceiling amount  a provision for additional depreciation  depletion and amortization is required 
discontinued operations and impairment of assets 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
for assets  other than oil and gas properties  including for the presentation and disclosure of discontinued operations 
we make assessments of impairment on a project by project basis 
management reviews assets for impairment when certain events have occurred that indicate that the asset may be impaired 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment provision is based on the excess of carrying value over fair value 
fair value is defined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a project 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and reserves as stated above 
all unamortized costs of oil and gas properties are limited to the sum of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of any unproved properties 
we completed an evaluation of the potential reserves and the economics related to our domestic oil and gas properties in and decided to focus our efforts on aligning the company with specific goals and projects that have gtl and ctl potential 
as a result  we discontinued further expenditures in the central kansas uplift area and began disposing of these properties 
we disposed of the majority of these properties in the final transaction occurred in january in december  we entered into an agreement to sell the common stock of the subsidiary that holds our interest in our international oil and gas projects 
the transaction closed in january with the execution of a common stock purchase agreement 
accordingly  we have also classified our international oil and gas activities in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and the net effect of the united states oil and gas activities  including the related gas processing plant and equipment  and international oil and gas activities  are presented in discontinued operations in the financial statements for the years ended december  and in accordance with sfas no 
critical estimates 
some of the more significant estimates made by management include  but are not limited to  valuation of stock based compensation  estimates for accrued liabilities and impairment of property and equipment 
actual results have not been materially different than the estimates made by management in the past 
management bases these estimates on the most current information available 
these estimates are subject to change in the future as a result of changes in the fair values of the assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents in the form of money market instruments at december  this compares to approximately  in cash and cash equivalents at december  our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and we are restricted in our options for investment by our short term cash flow requirements 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in a few financial institutions  however  we believe that our counter party risks are minimal based on the reputation and history of the institutions selected 
foreign exchange risk currently relates to deferred revenue  a portion of which is denominated in australian dollars 
financial statement assets and liabilities may be translated at prevailing exchange rate and may result in gains or losses in current income 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date 
transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations applicable to transactions denominated in a currency other than the united states dollar are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the portion of deferred revenue denominated in australian currency was us  at december  the deferred revenue is converted to us dollars for financial reporting purposes at the end of every reporting period 
to the extent that conversion results in gains or losses  such gains or losses will be reflected in our statements of operations 
the exchange rate of the australian dollar to the united states dollar was and at december  and december   respectively 
we do not have any purchased futures contracts or any derivative financial instruments  other than warrants issued to purchase common stock at a fixed price in connection with consulting agreements  private placements and other equity offerings
