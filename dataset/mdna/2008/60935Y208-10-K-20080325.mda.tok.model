we recognized a gain from discontinued operations of million in the consolidated statements of loss income in the gain is comprised of the net of the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the following discussion of our results of operations is focused on our continuing businesses 

table of contents results of operations summary following are significant items affecting operating results from continuing operations in during  we recorded billion of net securities losses resulting from the decline in the value of our investment portfolio 
this resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of billion for fee and other revenue increased percent to million in from million in  driven primarily by continued growth in money transfer transaction volume 
our global funds transfer segment fee and other revenue grew percent in over  driven by percent growth in money transfer transaction revenue and percent growth in transaction volume 
expenses increased percent in over  driven primarily by increased transaction and operations support costs  increased headcount and increased infrastructure costs supporting the growth in our money transfer business and increases in depreciation and amortization 
during september  the asset backed securities market and broader credit markets began to experience significant disruption  with a general lack of liquidity in the markets and deterioration in fair value of mortgage backed securities triggered by concerns surrounding sub prime mortgages 
in late november and december  the asset backed securities and credit markets experienced further substantial deterioration under increasing concerns over defaults on mortgages and debt in general  as well as an increasingly negative view towards all structured investments and the credit market 
in december  we began to experience adverse changes to the cash flows from some of our asset backed investments 
as the market continued its substantial deterioration  we identified a need for additional capital and commenced a plan in january to realign our investment portfolio away from asset backed securities and into highly liquid assets through the sale of a substantial portion of the investment portfolio 
as a result of these developments  we recognized billion of other than temporary impairments in december see liquidity and capital resources impact of credit market disruption for further information 
the declines in the portfolio did not have an immediate impact on our liquidity  but rather created a need for long term capital 
in december  we completed our strategic review of our payment systems segment 
as a result of this review  we have begun to restructure our official check business model by changing our commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships 
this restructuring will enable us to continue providing these essential services by focusing on small to mid sized institutions 
we expect to exit contracts with most of our top ten official check customers  who together account for approximately billion of our official check payment service obligations 
included in the top ten official check customers are the financial institutions for which we maintain special purpose entities spes 
with the sale of investments and the capital transaction defined below  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to manage the exiting of these customers without disruption to daily operating liquidity needs 
capital transaction the company completed a recapitalization transaction on march  pursuant to which the company received a substantial infusion of both equity and debt capital the capital transaction to support the long term needs of the business and to provide necessary capital due to the investment portfolio losses 
the equity component consisted of a million private placement of participating convertible preferred stock 
the debt component consisted of the issuance of million of senior secured second lien notes with a ten year maturity 
additionally  we entered into a senior secured amended and restated credit agreement amending the company s existing million debt facility to increase the facility by million to a total facility size of million 
the new facility includes million in two term loan tranches and a million revolving credit facility 
for a description of the terms of the equity and debt components of the capital transaction discussed below  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sale of investments and capital transaction and note subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds of the capital transaction were used to invest in cash equivalents to supplement our unrestricted assets 

table of contents components of net revenue our net revenue consists of fee and other revenue  investment revenue and net securities gains and losses  less commission expense 
we generate net revenue primarily by charging transaction fees in excess of third party agent commissions  managing foreign currency exchange and managing our investments to provide returns in excess of commissions paid to financial institution customers 
we derive revenue primarily through service fees charged to consumers and through our investments 
fee and other revenue consist of transaction fees  foreign exchange and miscellaneous revenue 
transaction fees are fees earned on the sale of money transfers  retail money order and bill payment products and official check transactions 
money transfer transaction fees are fixed per transaction and may vary based upon the face value of the amount of the transaction and the location in which the money transfer originates and to which it is sent 
money order and bill payment transaction fees are fixed per transaction 
foreign exchange revenue is derived from the management of currency exchange spreads on international money transfer transactions 
miscellaneous revenue primarily consists of processing fees on rebate checks and controlled disbursements  service charges on aged outstanding money orders and money order dispenser fees 
investment revenue consists of interest and dividends generated through the investment of cash balances received from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments 
these cash balances are available to us for investment until the payment instrument is presented for payment 
investment revenue varies depending on the level of investment balances and the yield on our investments 
investment balances vary based on the number of payment instruments sold  the average face amount of those payment instruments and the average length of time that passes until the instruments are presented for payment 
net securities gains and losses consist of realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and other than temporary impairments of investments 
we incur commission expense on our money transfer products and our investments 
we pay fee commissions to our third party agents for money transfer services 
in a money transfer transaction  both the agent initiating the transaction and the agent disbursing the funds receive a commission 
the commission amount generally is based on a percentage of the fee charged to the consumers 
we generally do not pay commissions to agents on the sale of money orders 
fee commissions also include the amortization of capitalized incentive payments to agents 
investment commissions are amounts paid to financial institution customers based on the average outstanding cash balances generated by the sale of official checks  as well as costs associated with swaps and the sale of receivables program 
in december  the company made a decision to cease selling receivables through a gradual reduction in the balances sold each period 
as of january  the company did not have a sold receivables balance remaining see further discussion on our sale of receivables program in note sale of receivables of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our interest rate swaps  we pay a fixed amount to a counterparty and receive a variable rate payment in return 
to the extent that the fixed rate exceeds the variable rate  we incur an expense related to the swap  conversely  if the variable rate exceeds the fixed rate  we receive income related to the swap 
under our receivables program  we sold our receivables at a discount to accelerate our cash flow  this discount was recorded as an expense 
commissions paid to financial institution customers generally are variable based on short term interest rates 
we utilize interest rate swaps  as described above  to convert a portion of our variable rate commission payments to fixed rate payments 
these swaps assist us in managing the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate commissions paid to our financial institution customers

a significant amount of our internationally originated transactions and settlements with international agents are conducted in the euro 
in addition  the operating expenses of most of our international subsidiaries are denominated in the euro 
in  the euro strengthened significantly against the us dollar 
while the strong euro benefits the internationally originated revenue in our consolidated statement of loss income  this benefit is significantly offset by the impact on commissions paid and operating expenses incurred in euros

growth in money transfer fee and other revenue including bill payment services continued to be in line with growth in money transfer transaction volume  which increased percent during the year as a result of our network expansion and targeted pricing initiatives 
transaction growth resulted in incremental fee and other revenue of million 
this transaction growth was offset slightly by a million decrease in money transfer fees resulting from targeted pricing initiatives and changes in geographic and product mix money transfer versus urgent bill payment 
the change in the euro exchange rate increased total fee and other revenue by million in compared to our simplified pricing initiatives  which were initiated in the first half of  included reducing the number of pricing tiers or bands  allowing us to manage our price volume dynamic while streamlining the point of sale process for our agents and customers 
while simplified pricing initiatives have contributed to a lower average per transaction fee  we believe that the initiatives have contributed to our volume growth as simpler pricing and lower overall fees attracts new customers 
during  the gap between total revenue growth and money transfer transaction growth narrowed primarily because we lapped the first year of implementation of simplified pricing initiatives

average per transaction fees in money transfer and bill payment services were lower in  reducing fee and other revenue by million primarily as a result of our simplified pricing initiative and as a result of shifts in product and geographic origination mix 
money transfer and bill payment transactions continued to drive fee and other revenue growth in  while money order transactions  which have higher margins  declined 
our domestic transactions  which contributed lower revenue per transaction  grew at a faster rate than internationally originated transactions

the average balance in the table reflects only the payment service obligations for which commissions are paid and does not include the average balance of the sold receivables million  million and million for  and  respectively as these are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
average yields rates are calculated by dividing the applicable amount shown in the components of net investment revenue section by the applicable amount shown in the average balances section 
the net investment margin is calculated by dividing net investment revenue by the cash equivalents and investments average balance 
investment revenue in increased one percent over due to wider spreads earned in and higher average investable balances in  but were partially offset by higher investment revenue in that benefited from million in cash flows from previously impaired investments and income from limited partnership interests 
during the last half of  our cash investments and adjustable rate securities  which are primarily tied to libor  earned a wider spread due to the disruption in the credit markets 
investment revenue in increased seven 
table of contents percent over due to higher yields on the portfolio from rising short term interest rates and the benefit from previously impaired investments and income from limited partnership interests  but was partially offset by lower average investable balances 
investment commissions expense in increased two percent compared to the prior year  reflecting higher commissions paid to financial institution customers resulting from an increase of basis points in the average federal funds rate over the prior year 
investment commissions expense in increased four percent compared to the prior year as rising short term rates resulted in higher commissions paid to financial institution customers and increased the amount of the cost of receivables sold 
the impact of rising rates in was significantly offset by lower swap costs 
lower swap costs are the result of maturing high rate swaps replaced by lower rate swaps  increases in short term rates and lower notional swap balances 
the company had billion of outstanding swaps with an average fixed pay rate of percent at december   compared to billion with an average fixed pay rate of percent at december  approximately billion of swaps matured during the run off of the lower priced swaps during increased investment commission expense over the same period in the prior year 
approximately seven percent of the notional value of our swaps will roll off during the first quarter of the remaining balance will roll off beginning in and continuing through in the first quarter of  the company terminated three outstanding swaps with a notional value of million in connection with the sale of the investments related to these swaps 
net investment revenue decreased percent in compared to reflecting the benefit of pre tax cash flow on previously impaired investments and income from limited partnerships recorded in and higher investment commission expense in net investment margin decreased basis points to percent in compared to  reflecting a decrease in net investment revenue and somewhat offset by an increase in average investable balances 
during  net investment revenue increased percent compared to  with the net investment margin increasing basis points to percent 
during  the average federal funds rate increased basis points and the average year us treasury note increased basis points 
these changes in interest rates are representative of the flat yield curve environment in which we operated in during  the average federal funds rate increased basis points and the average year us treasury note increased basis points 
the and margins benefited from the investment revenue items discussed above  as well as the lower swap costs 
in january  we commenced a process to realign our investment portfolio away from asset backed securities into highly liquid assets 
we anticipate the realigned portfolio will be comprised primarily of cash equivalents and government and government agency securities 
in addition  the company began a restructuring of its official check business model by changing its commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships 
as a result  we anticipate that our net investment margins will be adversely affected on a going forward basis by the lower yields in our realigned portfolio 
while we expect our commission re pricing initiatives under the official check restructuring to substantially offset the impact of the lower yields from the realigned portfolio  we will not know the final results of the re pricing initiatives for some time

incentive compensation decreased million due to the company s performance and stock price decline  offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in stock based compensation expense is due primarily to the high value of the company s stock price at the date of the grants  partially offset by a lower number of awards being earned in the current year 
the change in the euro exchange rate  which is reflected in each of the amounts discussed above  increased compensation and benefits by approximately million compared to as of december   the number of employees increased percent over as we increased headcount for our support functions and continued to staff our retail locations in france and germany

provision for loss increased in by million over  with no noticeable trends driving the increase 
as our agent base and transaction volumes continue to grow  we expect that provision for loss will increase  however  we expect this growth to be much slower than agent base and transaction growth due to our underwriting and credit monitoring processes 
professional fees increased million primarily due to increased contractor and consulting fees to support compliance activities and enhancements to our technology systems and increased credit servicing fees 
marketing costs increased million  agent forms and supplies costs increased million and licensing fees increased by million  all primarily due to the increase in agent locations

these increases were partially offset by a million decline in provision for uncollectible receivables primarily resulting from the additional provision of million in for one agent 
in addition  in  we recognized an impairment of million due to the discontinuation of a software development project 

table of contents we continue to see a trend among state and federal regulators toward enhanced scrutiny of anti money laundering compliance 
as we continue to add staff resources and enhancements to our technology systems to address this trend  our transaction expenses will likely increase 
in addition  we anticipate that our transaction expenses will increase due to marketing spend  investment in the agent network and development of our retail network in western europe

we are continuing to evaluate available tax positions related to the net securities losses  which may result in future tax benefits 
the corporate tax rate in and is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to income from tax exempt bonds in our investment portfolio

average per transaction fees in money transfer and bill payment services were lower in  reducing fee and other revenue by million  primarily as a result of our simplified pricing initiative 
in addition  average per transaction fees were lower in than as a result of shifts in product and geographic origination mix 
money transfer and bill payment transactions continued to drive fee and other revenue growth in  while money order transactions  which have higher margins  declined 
domestic originated transactions including bill payment grew percent with growth across all corridors  while international originated transactions grew percent from transaction volume to mexico grew percent in over our mexico volume represented percent and percent of our total transactions in and  respectively

fee and other revenue for retail money order decreased seven percent and two percent in and  respectively  compared to the prior year 
these decreases are in line with declines in volume for both years 
the company expects to see a decline in money order fee and other revenue of approximately percent in investment revenue in the global funds transfer segment decreased one percent in compared to due to lower average investable balances and as benefited from million of pre tax cash flow on previously impaired investments and income from limited partnership interests 
pre tax cash flows in from previously impaired investments and income from limited partnership interests was nominal 
partially offsetting these decreases was the benefit from wider spreads earned on our cash investments and adjustable rate securities due to the disruption in the credit markets in the second half of net securities losses in reflect other than temporary impairments of million that were recorded on our investment portfolio and allocated to this segment 
see further discussion of the losses in note investments substantially restricted and note subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
investment revenue increased percent in compared to primarily due to higher average yields which were partially offset by lower average investable balances 
net securities losses were flat in compared to commissions expense in was up percent compared to  primarily driven by tiered commission rates paid to certain agents and increases in the euro exchange rate 
tiered commissions are commission rates that are adjusted upward  subject to certain caps  as an agent s transaction volume grows 
we use tiered commission rates as an incentive for select agents to grow transaction volume by paying the agents for performance and allowing the agent to participate in adding market share for moneygram 
our largest agent  wal mart  achieved new tiers in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of in conjunction with our capital transaction  we extended the term of the current agreement with wal mart through january and agreed to certain commission increases over the extended term of the contract

as compared to  commissions expense in was up percent  primarily driven by the percent growth in fee and other revenue 
commissions expense as a percentage of revenue increased from percent in to percent in  primarily due to tiered commission rates paid to certain agents and product mix as growth in the money transfer business outpaced money orders

the tax exempt investments in the investment portfolio have lower pre tax yields  but produce higher income on an after tax basis than comparable taxable investments 
as income taxes are not allocated to the company s operating segments  the effect of tax exempt securities on the payment systems segment is not apparent in measures presented under gaap 
accordingly  an adjustment is made to present revenue and operating income resulting from amounts invested in tax exempt securities on a taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment is calculated using a percent tax rate applied to interest income from tax exempt securities and is million  million and million for  and  respectively

total revenue for includes million of cash flows from previously impaired securities and income from limited partnership interests 
such cash flows were nominal for total revenue increased five percent in compared to due primarily to higher investment revenue from higher yields earned on the portfolio from the increase in short term interest rates 
commissions expense includes payments made to financial institution customers based on official check average investable balances and short term interest rate indices  as well as costs associated with swaps and the sale of receivables program 
commissions expense increased two percent in  primarily due to higher commissions paid to financial institution customers resulting from an increase in the average federal funds rate over the prior year  as well as the run off of interest rate swaps 
commissions expense increased four percent in  primarily due to higher commissions paid to financial institutions as short term interest rates increased 
commissions expense as a percentage of investment revenue was percent for all years presented

the operating margin in decreased to percent percent on a taxable equivalent basis as compared to operating margin of percent percent on a taxable equivalent basis  primarily due to lower average investable balances and a million charge for the discontinuance of a development project 
the cash flows from previously impaired securities  income from limited partnership interests and termination fee contributed a combined percentage points and percentage points  respectively  to the operating margin in each of and in late  moneygram conducted a comprehensive review of the payment systems segment 
as a result of this review  the company has begun to restructure its official check business model by changing its commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships 
this restructuring will enable the company to continue providing these essential services by focusing on small to mid sized institutions 
the company expects to exit contracts with most of its top ten official check customers  who together account for approximately billion of the company s official check payment obligations  thereby significantly reducing our official check business 
also impacting the payment systems segment is the process commenced in january to realign our investment portfolio away from asset backed securities into highly liquid assets 
we anticipate that the realigned portfolio will be comprised primarily of cash equivalents  government and government agency securities 
as a result  we anticipate that our profit margins in the official check business will be adversely affected by the lower yields in our realigned portfolio 
while we expect our commission re pricing initiatives under the official check restructuring to fully offset the impact of the lower yields from the realigned portfolio  we will not know the final results of the re pricing initiatives for some time 
liquidity and capital resources one of our primary financial goals is to maintain adequate liquidity to manage the fluctuations in the balances of payment service assets and obligations resulting from sales of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments  the timing of the collections of receivables and the timing of the presentment of such instruments for payment 
in addition  we strive to maintain adequate liquidity for capital expenditures and other normal operating cash needs 
another primary financial goal is to maintain adequate capital to ensure the on going compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements through the fluctuations in the balances of our payment service assets and obligations  particularly investments 

table of contents we have various resources available to us for purposes of managing liquidity and capital needs  including our cash  cash equivalents  investments  credit facilities  reverse repurchase agreements and letters of credit 
for purposes of this discussion  we use the term investments to refer to our long term investment portfolio  while the term cash equivalents refers to our short term investment portfolio 
short term investments are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets and are used in managing our daily operating liquidity needs 
long term investments are classified as trading or available for sale as explained in note description of the business of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are used in managing our capital needs 
liquidity we utilize our cash  cash equivalents and reverse repurchase agreements as the main tools to manage our daily operating liquidity needs 
our operating liquidity needs relate to the monies required to settle our payment instruments on a daily basis and fund the routine operating activities of the business 
on a daily basis  we move on average over billion to settle our payment instruments and make related settlements with our agents and financial institutions 
we receive a similar amount on a daily basis from our agents and financial institutions for the face amount and related fees of our payment instruments sold 
we have agreements with clearing banks that provide clearing and processing functions for official checks  money orders and share drafts 
for the clearing of money orders  we rely primarily on one clearing bank 
in addition  we maintain contractual relationships with a variety of domestic and international cash management banks for ach and wire transfer services to move customer funds and make agent payments 
the relationships with these clearing banks and cash management banks are a critical component of the company s ability to move monies on a global and timely basis 
we rely on the funds from on going sales of payment instruments and portfolio cash flows to settle our payment service obligations pso as they are presented 
our daily net cash settlements tend to follow a pattern whereby certain days of the week are typically net cash inflow days  while other days are typically net cash outflow days 
on the days with a net cash outflow  we have historically utilized our cash equivalents  as well as repurchase agreements  to fund the shortfall 
on the next cash inflow day  excess cash is used to repay any amounts outstanding under the repurchase agreements  with the remaining excess cash reinvested in cash equivalents 
the repurchase agreements are uncommitted facilities with various banks and require specific securities to be designated as collateral for borrowings under the agreements 
the acceptance of securities as collateral is at the discretion of our counterparty 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began investing more heavily in cash equivalents to enhance our liquidity 
this shift was accomplished by reinvesting proceeds from normal maturities of our long term investments into cash equivalents 
as a result of this enhanced liquidity  we have reduced our use of repurchase agreements 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding under repurchase agreements 
for certain of our financial institution customers  we established individual spes upon the origination of our relationship 
along with operational processes and certain financial covenants  these spes provide the financial institutions with additional assurance of our ability to clear their official checks 
under these relationships  the cash  cash equivalents  investments and pso related to the financial institution customer are all held by the spe 
in most cases  the fair value of the cash  cash equivalents and investments must be maintained in excess of the pso 
as the financial institution customer sells our payment service instruments  the face amount of the instrument and any fees are paid into the spe 
as payment service instruments issued by the financial institution customer are presented for payment  the cash and cash equivalents within the spe are used to settle the instrument 
as a result  cash and cash equivalents within spes are generally not available for use outside of the spe 
we remain liable to satisfy the obligations  both contractually and under the uniform commercial code  as the issuer and drawer of the official checks regardless of the existence of the spes 
accordingly  we consolidate all of the assets and liabilities of these spes in our consolidated balance sheets  with the individual assets and liabilities of the spes classified in a manner similar to our other assets and liabilities 
for further information relating to the spes  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual and regulatory capital we use investments and credit facilities to manage our capital needs deriving from contractual and regulatory requirements 
due to the continuous nature of the sales and settlement of our payment instruments as described above  we are able to invest in securities with a longer term than the average life of our payment instruments to 
table of contents provide for long term capital needs 
we strive to have cash  cash equivalents  receivables and investments in excess of our pso in an amount which allows us to maintain compliance with all contractual and regulatory requirements during normal fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities 
we refer to this excess as our unrestricted assets 
assets restricted for regulatory or contractual reasons are not available to satisfy working capital or other financing requirements 
in connection with our senior credit facility  one clearing bank contract and the spes  we have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain pre defined ratios of certain assets to pso as presented in the consolidated balance sheets 
as more fully described in note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the financial covenants under our credit facilities relate to the maintenance of pre defined ratios of interest coverage  leverage and consolidated total indebtedness collectively  the debt covenants 
one clearing bank contract has financial covenants that include the maintenance of total cash  cash equivalents  receivables and investments in an amount at least equal to total outstanding pso the total company ratio  as well as the maintenance of a minimum percent ratio of total assets held at that bank to instruments estimated to clear through that bank the clearing bank ratio 
financial covenants related to the spes include the maintenance of specified ratios  typically greater than percent  of cash  cash equivalents and investments held in the spe to outstanding payment instruments issued by the related financial institution 
in addition  under limited circumstances  these financial institution customers with spes have the right to either demand liquidation of the assets in the spes or to replace us as the administrator of the spe 
such limited circumstances consist of material  and in most cases continued  failure to uphold our warranties and obligations pursuant to the underlying agreements with the financial institutions 
in addition  we are regulated by various state agencies which generally require us to maintain a pool of liquid assets and investments with a rating of a or higher in an amount generally equal to the regulatory pso measure  as defined by the state  for our regulated payment instruments  namely teller checks  agent checks  money orders and money transfers 
the regulatory requirements are similar to  but less restrictive than  our unrestricted assets measure 
the regulatory pso measure varies by state  but in all cases is substantially lower than our pso as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets as we are not regulated by state agencies for pso resulting from outstanding cashier s checks or for amounts payable to agents and brokers 
all states also require mpsi  the licensed entity and our wholly owned operating subsidiary  to maintain positive net worth  with one state also requiring mpsi to maintain positive tangible net worth 
the regulatory and contractual requirements do not require us to specify individual assets held to meet our psos  nor are we required to deposit specific assets into a trust  escrow or other special account 
rather  we must maintain a pool of liquid assets 
no third party places limitations  legal or otherwise  on us regarding the use of our individual liquid assets 
we are able to withdraw  deposit or sell our individual liquid assets at will  with no prior notice or penalty  provided we maintain a total pool of liquid assets sufficient to meet the regulatory and contractual requirements 
the total company ratio is the most restrictive of our financial covenants under all contractual and regulatory requirements 
we monitor compliance with the total company ratio by monitoring the amount of our unrestricted assets 
impact of the credit market disruption during september  the asset backed securities market and broader credit markets began to experience significant disruption  with a general lack of liquidity in the markets and deterioration in fair value of mortgage backed securities triggered by concerns surrounding sub prime mortgages 
in response to these concerns  the rating agencies undertook extensive reviews of asset backed securities  particularly mortgage backed securities 
as a result of these developments  we experienced a net decline of million in the fair value of its investment portfolio from june  through september  as we monitored the deterioration in the market in september  we decided to draw the million available balance of our revolving credit facility to supplement our unrestricted assets to ensure that a sufficient cushion over the total company ratio was maintained if there was any further market deterioration 
as of october   we maintained compliance with all contractual and regulatory requirements  even without considering the proceeds of the million draw on the revolver 
in addition  preliminary valuations of the investment portfolio as of october  showed a 
table of contents substantially lower rate of decline in fair value 
we continued to closely monitor the performance of our investments  market developments and the impact of rating agency actions on our portfolio 
with few exceptions  our investments continued to provide for all contractual cash flows and evidenced little  if any  actual losses from defaults through early november as a result  through early november  we believed we had sufficient unrestricted assets to maintain compliance with all of our contractual and regulatory requirements through any further market deterioration 
as the unrealized losses on the investment portfolio had no immediate impact on our cash flows  there was no disruption to our operating liquidity 
in late november and december  the asset backed securities and credit markets experienced further substantial deterioration under increasing concerns over defaults on mortgages and debt in general  as well as an increasingly negative view of all structured investments and the credit market in general 
this deterioration caused the market to demand higher risk premiums and liquidity discounts on asset backed securities  as well as assume higher rates of defaults than previously anticipated through october as a result of these market developments  the fair value for asset backed securities as of november  substantially declined by an additional million from september  in addition  the rating agencies continued their review of securities  issuing broad rating downgrades based on high levels of assumed future defaults 
under the terms of certain of our asset backed securities  ratings downgrades of collateral securities can reduce the cash flows to all but the most senior investors even if there have been no actual losses incurred by the collateral securities 
in december  we began to experience adverse changes to the cash flows from some of our asset backed investments as a result of the accumulating rating downgrades of the underlying collateral securities 
as the market continued its substantial deterioration in december  we identified a need for additional capital as we anticipated that we would not be in compliance with our total company ratio and our debt covenants as of december  through meetings with potential investors in late december and early january  it became evident that we would need to divest certain investments in connection with any recapitalization to substantially reduce the risk of any further deterioration in the investment portfolio 
we commenced a plan in january to realign our investment portfolio away from asset backed securities and into highly liquid assets through the sale of a substantial portion of the investment portfolio 
based on these developments  we determined that we no longer had the intent to hold until maturity or call substantially all of our investments classified as obligations of states and political subdivisions  commercial mortgage backed securities  residential mortgage backed securities  other asset backed securities  corporate debt securities and preferred and common stock 
as a result of these developments  we recognized billion of other than temporary impairments in december  causing a shortfall in unrestricted assets 
following are the unrestricted assets as of table unrestricted assets december  september  june  march  december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents substantially restricted receivables  net substantially restricted trading investments substantially restricted available for sale investments substantially restricted amounts restricted to cover payment service obligations shortfall excess of unrestricted assets 
table of contents impact on contractual and regulatory capital the shortfall in unrestricted assets of million was the direct result of the market developments in late november and december  causing us to be out of compliance with the total company ratio 
as of december   our regulated subsidiary mpsi was in compliance with state regulatory requirements  with the exception of one state where mpsi was out of compliance with the tangible net worth requirement 
subsequent to december   we were out of compliance with certain other state regulatory requirements  including minimum net worth requirements 
we have not received notice of any enforcement actions contemplated by the regulators  but the regulators reserve the right to take action in the future and could impose fines and penalties related to the compliance failure 
with the completion of the capital transaction  as of march   we are in compliance with all regulatory requirements for all states 
we received waivers of default through may  from both the clearing bank and credit agreement lenders through amendments to their respective agreements 
these waivers were superceded by amendments to these agreements made in conjunction with the capital transaction 
impact on liquidity the declines in the investment portfolio through december  created a need for regulatory and contractual capital  but did not immediately impact our liquidity 
although we had a shortfall in our unrestricted assets  daily operating and short term liquidity needs were not affected due to the nature of our business whereby daily remittances to us are used to pay the daily clearings of our instruments 
in addition  approximately million of our pso at december  are greater than one year old 
we have continued to meet our daily operating and short term liquidity needs and believe that we will continue to do so with the completion of the capital transaction 
we have agreed with certain of our clearing banks to make funding changes  including providing additional intra day funding  due to concerns over the impact of the market disruption on the company 
additionally  we have revised the funding arrangements with a few agents  including changes to their remittance patterns  pre funding by the company and  in one case  creating a trust for the benefit of the agent s consumers 
these changes have altered our total liquidity needs and changed the timing of cash inflows and outflows 
while we believe the capital transaction will restore more ordinary funding protocols with the clearing banks  it is possible that clearing banks will require advance funding or other security  or even terminate their relationships with us 
we believe the requests for amendments to agent agreements will decrease as a result of the capital transaction 
downgrade of debt rating in january  moody s investor service moody s  standard poors s p and fitch ratings fitch downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non investment grade at ba  bb and bb  respectively 
in march  s p downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b 
moody s  s p and fitch have also placed us on watch for potential additional downgrades 
the three major credit rating agencies have cited  among other factors  the reduction in our unrestricted assets caused by our net unrealized losses and other than temporary impairments as the rationale for these downgrades  despite the growth and profitability of our core money transfer business 
a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision at any time and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
it is possible that one or more rating agencies will in the future downgrade our debt rating further  and that further downgrades could increase our cost of borrowing 
it is important to note that state and federal regulatory authorities do not consider such ratings as criteria in determining licensing or regulatory compliance 
accordingly any change in debt ratings is not expected to directly affect our regulatory status as a money services business 
the financial impact of any downgrade in our debt ratings will depend on the actual ratings  whether the ratings are split between investment and non investment grade and which agency takes this action 
it is also possible that ratings downgrades could affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
sale of investments and capital transaction subsequent to december   we sold substantially all of our investment portfolio for a realized loss of million 
this realized loss is incremental to the billion other than temporary impairment charge we recognized in december on march   we completed the capital transaction  pursuant to which we received an infusion of billion of both equity and debt capital to support the long term needs of the business and provide necessary capital due to the investment portfolio losses 
the terms of the capital transaction are set forth 
table of contents below 
the net proceeds of the capital transaction were used to invest in cash equivalents to supplement our unrestricted assets and to repay million on our revolving credit facility 
with the capital transaction and sale of investments  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital to operate and grow our business for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
we expect operating cash flows to be sufficient to finance our on going business  pay interest expense on our outstanding debt  maintain adequate capital levels and meet debt and clearing agreement covenants 
should liquidity and capital needs exceed operating cash flows  we believe our external financing sources  including availability under the new senior credit facility  will be sufficient to meet any shortfalls 
had the capital transaction and sale of investments occurred on december   the pro forma unrestricted assets would be as follows as reported pro forma december  sales of capital december  amounts in thousands investments transactions cash and cash equivalents receivables  net trading investments available for sale investments amounts restricted to cover payment service obligations unrestricted assets the reduction to the available for sale investments is determined using the fair value of the sold investments as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents is determined using the actual cash proceeds from these sales  which were invested in cash and cash equivalents 
amounts for the capital transactions are determined based on the actual proceeds received  net of related transaction costs of million  the million payment on the revolving credit facility and a million discount on the debt issued by the company 
equity capital the equity component of the capital transaction consisted of the private placement of  shares  in aggregate  of series b participating convertible preferred stock of the company the series b preferred stock and shares of non voting series b participating convertible preferred stock of the company the series b preferred stock collectively  the series b stock to affiliates of thomas h 
lee partners  lp thl and affiliates of goldman  sachs co 
goldman sachs collectively  the investors for an aggregate purchase price of million

the series b preferred stock was issued to thl and the series b preferred stock was issued to goldman sachs 
furthermore  in connection with the capital transaction  the company paid goldman sachs an investment banking advisory fee equal to million in the form of  shares of series b preferred stock 
the series b stock pays a cash dividend of ten percent 
at our option  we may accrue dividends at a rate of percent in lieu of paying a cash dividend 
dividends may be accrued for up to five years from the date of the capital transaction 
after five years  if we are unable to pay the dividends in cash  dividends will accrue at a rate of percent 
at this time  the company expects that dividends will be accrued and not paid in cash for at least five years 
the series b stock participates in dividends with the common stock on an as converted basis 
the series b preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock of the company at a price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the series b preferred stock is convertible into series b preferred stock by any stockholder other than goldman sachs 
while held by goldman sachs  the series b preferred stock is convertible into series d preferred stock  which is a non voting common equivalent stock 
the series b stock may be redeemed at the option of the company if  after five years from the date of the capital transaction  the common stock trades above  subject to adjustment  for a period of thirty consecutive trading days 
the series b stock will be redeemable at the option of the investors after ten years and upon a change in 
table of contents control 
the series b preferred stock will vote as a class with the common stock and will have a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable if all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock were converted plus the number of shares of common stock issuable if all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock were converted into series b preferred stock and subsequently converted into common stock 
rights agreements as part of the capital transaction  we amended our rights agreement with wells fargo bank  na as rights agent  to exempt the issuance of securities to the investors and their affiliates from the rights agreement

we are generally obligated to keep the shelf registration statement effective for up to years or  if earlier  until all the securities owned by the investors have been sold 
the investors are also entitled to five demand registrations and unlimited piggyback registrations 
senior credit facility as part of the capital transaction  our wholly owned subsidiary moneygram payment systems worldwide  inc worldwide entered into a senior credit facility the senior facility of million with various lenders and jpmorgan chase bank  n 
a jpmorgan  as administrative agent for the lenders 
the senior facility amended and restated the million amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of june   among the company and a group of lenders and includes an additional million term loan 
in connection with this transaction  the company terminated its million day credit agreement with jpmorgan 
the senior facility includes million in two term loan tranches and a million revolving credit facility 
tranche a of the term loans is for million and tranche b is for million 
tranche b was issued at a discount of percent  or million 
the interest rate applicable to tranche a and the revolving credit facility is the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
the interest rate applicable to tranche b is the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
the maturity date of the senior facility is march fees on the daily unused availability under the revolving credit facility are basis points 
at march   we had outstanding borrowings under the senior facility of million 
there is a prepayment premium on the tranche b term loan of two percent during the first year and one percent during the second year of the senior facility 
loans under the senior facility are secured by substantially all our non financial assets and are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries  with such guarantees secured by the non financial assets of the subsidiaries 
borrowings under the senior facility are subject to various covenants  including limitations on use of proceeds from borrowings under the senior facility  additional indebtedness  mergers and consolidations  sales of assets  dividends and other restricted payments  investments  loans and advances and transactions with affiliates 
the senior facility also has certain financial covenants  including an interest coverage ratio and a senior secured debt ratio 
compliance with such financial covenants will not be required until the fiscal quarter ending march  under the senior facility  we must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of from march  through september   from december  through september  and from december  through maturity 
we are not permitted to have a senior secured debt ratio in excess of from march  through september   from december  through september   from december  through september   from december  through september  and from december  through maturity 
the senior facility also contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain at least a ratio of certain assets to outstanding payment service obligations 
second lien notes as part of the capital transaction  worldwide issued goldman sachs million of senior secured second lien notes the notes  which will mature in march the interest rate on the notes is percent per year unless interest is capitalized  in which case the interest rate increases to percent 
prior to march   we have the option to capitalize interest of percent  but must pay in cash percent of the interest payable

the covenants also substantially restrict our ability to incur additional debt  create or incur liens and invest assets that are subject to restrictions for the payment of payment service obligations 
we are also required to maintain at least a ratio of certain assets to outstanding payment service obligations 
we can redeem the notes after five years at specified premiums 
prior to the fifth anniversary  we may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  plus a premium equal to the greater of one percent or an amount calculated by discounting the sum of a the redemption payment that would be due upon the fifth anniversary plus b all required interest payments due through such fifth anniversary using the treasury rate plus basis points

inter creditor agreement in connection with the financing arrangements  the lenders under both the senior facility and the notes have agreed to be bound by the terms of an inter creditor agreement under which the lenders have agreed to waive certain rights and limit the exercise of certain remedies available to them for a limited period of time both before and following a default under the financing arrangements 
restructuring of the official check business in december  the company completed its review of our payment systems segment 
as a result of this review  the company has begun to restructure our official check business model by changing our commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships 
this restructuring will enable the company to continue providing these essential services by focusing on small to mid sized institutions 
the company expects to exit contracts with most of its top ten official check customers  who together account for approximately billion of the company s official check payment obligations 
included in the top ten official check customers are the financial institutions for which the company maintains spes 
with the sale of investments and the capital transaction  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to manage the exiting of these customers without disruption to daily operating liquidity needs 
other funding sources and requirements at december   we had uncommitted repurchase agreements  letters of credit and various overdraft facilities totaling billion available to assist in the management of our investments and the clearing of pso 
there was million outstanding under various letters of credit at december  contractual obligations the following table includes aggregated information about the company s contractual obligations that impact its liquidity and capital needs 
the table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by type of contractual obligation 
table contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years debt  including interest payments operating leases derivative financial instruments other obligations total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents debt consists of amounts outstanding under the term loan and revolving credit facility at december   as described in note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as related interest payments  facility fees and annual commitment fees 
as described above  the interest rate on our outstanding debt is based on a floating interest rate indexed to libor 
for disclosure purposes  the interest rate for future periods has been assumed to be to percent  which are the rates in effect on december  included in our consolidated balance sheet at december  is million of debt and million of accrued interest  which represents amounts owed as of december  the above table reflects the principal and interest that will be paid through the maturity of the debt using the rates in effect on december  operating leases consist of various leases for buildings and equipment used in our business 
derivative financial instruments represent the net payable receivable under our interest rate swap agreements 
other obligations are unfunded capital commitments related to our limited partnership interests included in our investment portfolio and a million indemnity holdback related to the acquisition of money express payable on the second anniversary of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition of propertybridge  we have an obligation for a potential earn out payment of up to million contingent on propertybridge s performance during this earn out payment  which is payable in  is not included in the above table as the amount is unknown at this time 
we anticipate that the ultimate earn out payment will be less than million 
we have funded  noncontributory pension plans

enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business  including interest rate risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  operational risk  regulatory risk and foreign currency exchange risk 
see part  item a risk factors for a description of the principal risks to our business 
our risk management objective is to monitor and control risk exposures to produce steady earnings growth and long term economic value 
the extent to which we properly and effectively manage each of the various types of risk is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
management implements policies approved by the company s board of directors covering our funding activity  investing activity and use of derivatives 
during  the board of directors had a finance and investment committee  consisting of five independent board members  which oversaw its investment  capital  credit and foreign currency policies and strategies 
the board s finance and investment committee receives periodic reports regarding the investment portfolio and results 
an asset liability committee  comprised of senior management  routinely reviews investment and risk management strategies and results 
following is a discussion of the strategies  with forward looking statements  used by the company to manage and mitigate interest rate risk  credit risk and foreign currency risk 
the analyses used to assess interest rate risk  credit risk and foreign currency risk are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain other factors as described in the following discussions 
during september  the asset backed securities market and broader credit markets began to show significant disruption  with a general lack of liquidity in the markets and deterioration in fair value of mortgage backed securities triggered by concerns surrounding sub prime mortgages 
in response to these concerns  the rating agencies undertook extensive reviews of asset backed securities  particularly mortgage backed securities 
in november and december  the asset backed securities and credit markets experienced further substantial deterioration under increasing concerns over defaults on mortgages and debt in general  as well as an increasingly negative view of all structured investments and the credit market in general 
in addition  the rating agencies continued their review of securities  issuing broad rating downgrades based on high levels of assumed future defaults 
as the market continued its substantial deterioration  we identified a need for additional capital 
through meetings with potential investors in late december and early january  it became evident that the company would need to divest certain investments in connection with any recapitalization to eliminate the risk of any further deterioration in the investment portfolio 
the company commenced a plan in january to realign its 
table of contents investment portfolio away from asset backed securities and into highly liquid assets through the sale of a substantial portion of the investment portfolio 
in december  we completed the review of our payment systems segment 
as a result of this review  we have begun to restructure our official check business model by reducing the commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships 
in addition  in december  we made the decision to cease selling receivables and subsequently terminated the sale of receivables facility in january on march   we completed the capital transaction pursuant to which we received a substantial infusion of both equity and debt capital to support the long term needs of the business and to provide necessary capital due to the investment portfolio losses 
the portfolio realignment  payment systems strategy and the capital transaction have had a significant impact on our business risks  particularly in the areas of credit and interest rate risk 
the composition of our investment portfolio changed significantly  as described in note subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate during that more than percent of our investments will be in cash and cash equivalents or securities primarily issued or guaranteed by the us government or a government backed agency 
credit risk credit risk represents the potential risk that we may not collect on interest or principal associated with our investments  as well as counterparty risk associated with our derivative financial instruments 
we are also exposed to the potential risk that we may not collect on funds received by agents in connection with money transfers and money orders  which are due to be remitted to the company 
investments our strategy has been to maximize the relative value versus return on each security  sector and collateral class 
we used a comprehensive process to manage our credit risk relating to investments  including active credit monitoring and quantitative sector analysis 
we also addressed credit risk by investing primarily in investments with ratings of a a or higher or collateralized by federal agency securities  as well as ensuring proper diversification of the portfolio by limiting individual investments to one percent of the total portfolio 
approximately percent of our available for sale investment portfolio at december  consisted of securities with an a or better rating 
for each of our asset backed securities with the exception of those backed by us government agency securities  we perform a periodic credit risk assessment under a systematic methodology 
the methodology employs a risk driven approach  whereby securities are assigned to risk classes based upon internally defined criteria 
the risk classes drive the frequency of the review with investments in the highest risk classes reviewed monthly 
after the realignment of the investment portfolio  we have a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents  primarily comprised of money market funds invested in us government funds 
therefore  our credit risk primarily relates to the concentration of assets in us government and government sponsored entities 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
if the counterparties to any of our derivative financial instruments were to default in payments or otherwise experience credit problems  the value of the derivative financial instruments would decline and adversely impact our earnings 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments by entering into agreements only with major financial institutions and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
agent receivables due to the nature of our business  the vast majority of the business of our global funds transfer segment is conducted through independent agents 
our agents receive the proceeds from the sale of our payment instruments and we must then collect these funds from the agents 
as a result  we have credit exposure to our agents  which averages approximately billion  representing a combination of money orders  money transfers and bill payment proceeds 
this credit exposure is spread across over  agents  of which owe us in excess of million each at any one time 
agents typically have from one to three days to remit the funds  with longer remittance schedules granted to international agents and certain domestic agents under certain circumstances 
we assess the creditworthiness of each potential agent before accepting it into our distribution network 
we 
table of contents actively monitor the credit risk of our agents by conducting periodic comprehensive financial reviews and cash flow analyses of our agents who average high volumes of money order sales 
in addition  we frequently take additional steps to minimize agent credit risk  such as requiring owner guarantees  corporate guarantees and other forms of security where appropriate 
we monitor remittance patterns versus reported sales by agent on a daily basis 
we also utilize software embedded in each point of sale terminal to control both the number and dollar amount of money orders sold 
this software also allows us to monitor for suspicious transactions or volumes of sales  assisting in uncovering irregularities such as money laundering  fraud or agent self use 
finally  we have the ability to remotely disable money order dispensers or transaction devices to prevent agents from issuing money orders or performing money transfers if suspicious activity is noted or remittances are not received according to the agent s contract 
the point of sale software requires each location to be re authorized on a daily basis for transaction processing 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential reduction in net investment revenue as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates 
through december   fluctuations in interest rates affected the revenue produced by our investment portfolio  the amount of commissions that we paid to customers in our payment systems segment  the net proceeds from our sale of receivables and the amounts that we received under our interest rate derivatives swaps 
as a result  our net investment revenue  which is the difference or spread between the amount we earn on our investment portfolio and the commissions we pay plus the discount on the sale of receivables  net of the effect of the swaps  was subject to interest rate risk as the components of net investment revenue were not perfectly matched through time and across all possible interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk was concentrated in our investment portfolio 
another component of interest rate risk is market risk that arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of investments and swaps 
stockholders equity can be adversely affected by changing interest rates  as after tax changes in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale investments and after tax changes in the fair value of swaps are reflected as increases and decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
historically  we have used a wide range of risk measures and analyses to manage the exposure  including on going business risk measures and analyses  run off measures of the existing portfolio and stress test scenarios 
the two main evaluators we used were net income at risk and duration gap 
net income at risk is measured using a static and forecasted portfolio under various interest rate shock environments 
duration gap is the estimated gap between our assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent that estimated cash flows are matched over time across various interest rate environments 
the third element to our strategy is setting parameters for risk measures to help attain corporate margin objectives 
management developed actions based upon a number of factors that include both net investment revenue at risk and duration gap  as well as current market conditions 
internal indicators were used to determine when the risk profile of our assets should be re examined 
as the risk measures begin to move beyond our internal indicators  we would consider actions to bring them into the preferred ranges  with an emphasis on time horizon and earnings objectives 
we use value at risk var modeling and net investment revenue simulation analysis for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk 
var is a risk assessment methodology that estimates the potential decline in the value of a security or portfolio under various market conditions 
var quantifies the change in market value due to changes in volatility and interest rates over a given time horizon  given a certain level of confidence 
we utilize var to quantify the potential decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio using a percent confidence level and a one month time horizon 
we use a monte carlo model that derives the interest rate change from volatility assumptions  specified probability and time horizon 
the model includes our investment portfolio and interest rate derivative contracts 
the net investment revenue simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities  together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
this analysis assumes the yield curve increases gradually over a one year period 
after the portfolio realignment  our portfolio is invested primarily in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid short term investments 
these types of investment have minimal interest rate risk as the yields change with changes in the related interest rate index 
we expect to match these floating rate investment yields with commission expense  which is paid to official check financial institution customers based on short term rates  typically the federal funds 
table of contents rate or libor 
consequently  the interest rate risk we were historically exposed to related to investments and payment service obligations is expected to be negligible going forward 
however  we will have some exposure to basis risk  which is the difference between the interest rate index of investments eg  us treasury rates and that of the payment service obligations eg  libor 
in addition  we have billion in notional amounts of swaps that convert a portion of the variable rate commissions to fixed rate payments 
with the portfolio realignment  we will need to re evaluate the use of the swaps  including possible termination  to better match our floating rate assets with our floating rate interest based commission indices 
in addition  we will be repricing official check customers to better align the commission paid to the rates earned on the realigned investment portfolio 
we performed our var analysis and net investment revenue simulation analysis taking into account the capital transaction  the payments systems strategy and the portfolio realignment 
the var is million  given a confidence level and a one month time horizon 
accordingly  there is a five percent chance the loss on the investment portfolio or swaps over the next month will exceed million 
the historical var is not meaningful given the portfolio realignment 
the results of the net investment revenue simulation analysis are reflected in table  which summarizes the changes to our pre tax income from continuing operations under various scenarios 
this modeling involves a number of assumptions including prepayments  interest rates and volatility 
the var model and net investment revenue simulation analyses are risk analysis tools and do not purport to represent actual losses that we will incur 
while we believe that these assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions could produce materially different estimates 
table interest rate sensitivity analysis basis point change in interest rates down down down up up up amounts in thousands pre tax income from continuing operations percent change foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange risk represents the potential adverse effect on our earnings from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affecting certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we offer our products and services through a network of agents and financial institutions with locations in over countries 
foreign exchange risk is managed through the structure of our business and certain business processes 
we are primarily affected by fluctuations in the us dollar as compared to the euro as a significant amount of our internationally originated transactions and settlements with international agents are conducted in the euro 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are generally very short term in nature 
we primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
these forward contracts generally have maturities of less than thirty days 
our policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies 
the forward contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  and the net effect of changes in exchange rates and the related forward contracts is not significant 
in addition  the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are denominated in the euro 
in  the euro strengthened significantly against the us dollar 
while the strong euro benefits the internationally originated revenue in our consolidated statement of loss income  this benefit is significantly offset by the impact on commissions paid and operating expenses incurred in euros 
in  the net impact of fluctuations in the euro exchange rate on our consolidated net loss income was minimal at million 
had the euro appreciated relative to the us dollar twenty percent over actual exchange rates for  pre tax operating income would have increased million for the year 
had the euro depreciated twenty percent under actual rates for  pre tax operating income would have decreased million for the year 
this sensitivity analysis considers both the impact on translation of our foreign denominated revenue and expense streams and the impact on our hedging program 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions and estimates to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
based on these criteria  management has identified and discussed with the audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates fair value of investment securities the company holds investment securities classified as trading and available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
trading securities  which consist solely of auction rate securities for all periods presented  are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in the consolidated statements of loss income 
securities classified as available for sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of an investment security is the amount that would be received from the sale of the security in an orderly transaction at the measurement date  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
this definition of fair value is commonly referred to as the exit price of a security 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an investment is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
fair value for the majority of our investments is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets  broker dealer quotes or through the use of industry standard models that utilize independently sourced market parameters 
these independently sourced market parameters are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions for similar securities are executed in the marketplace 
examples of such parameters include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves  reported trades  broker or dealer quotes  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
the company receives prices from an independent pricing service for a majority of our investments 
we verify these prices through periodic internal valuations  as well as through comparison to comparable securities  any broker dealer quotes received and liquidation prices 
the independent pricing service will only provide a price for an investment if there is sufficient observable market information to obtain objective pricing 
the company receives prices from an independent pricing service for investments classified as obligations of states and political subdivisions  commercial mortgage backed securities  residential mortgage backed securities  us government agencies  corporate debt securities  preferred and common stock and other asset backed securities with direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
for investments that are not actively traded  or for which there is not sufficient observable market information  the company estimates fair value using broker dealer quotes when available 
when such quotes are not available  and to verify broker dealer quotes received  the company estimates fair value using industry standard pricing models  discount margins for comparable securities adjusted for differences in the company s security  risk and liquidity premiums observed in the market place  default rates  prepayment speeds  loss severity and information specific to the underlying collateral to the investment 
the company maximizes the use of market observable information to the extent possible and makes its best estimate of the assumptions that a similar market participant would make 
investments which are primarily valued through the use of broker dealer quotes or internal valuations include those classified as other asset backed securities  excluding those with direct exposure to sub prime mortgages  and certain commercial mortgage backed securities 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date 
in the current market  the most subjective assumptions include the default rate of collateral securities and loss severity  particularly as it relates to the 
table of contents company s other asset backed securities 
subsequent to december   we sold substantially all of our investments classified as other asset backed securities 
at the date of this filing  we continue to hold investments classified as other asset backed securities with a fair value of million at december  using the highest and lowest prices received as part of the valuation process described above  the range of fair value for these securities was to million 
at december   million  or two percent  of our investment portfolio was valued using internal pricing information 
of this amount  million related to investments for which no price was received from the third party pricing service or brokers 
had the company used the third party price to value the remaining million of internally priced securities  the value of these investments would have ranged from million to million

 views on accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities 
the company writes down to fair value investments that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired through a charge against earnings in the period the securities are deemed to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value at the individual security level 
the company deems an individual investment to be other than temporarily impaired when the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value have made it probable in management s view that the company will not receive all of the cash flows contractually stipulated for the investment 
the company regularly monitors its investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely manner and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
pursuant to the company s review process  changes in individual security values and credit risk characteristics are regularly monitored to identify potential impairment indicators 
for all investments  the company assesses market conditions  macroeconomic factors and industry developments each period to identify any impairment indicators 
if an impairment indicator is identified  the company performs a credit assessment of the impacted investments 
in addition  the company performs a credit assessment for any investment with a rating downgrade during the period 
in addition  the company reviews all investments meeting established thresholds and monitoring criteria to identify investments that have indications of potential impairments or unfavorable trends that could lead to future potential impairments 
these thresholds and monitoring criteria include investments with a fair value significantly less than amortized cost  in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months  with a rating downgrade from the prior review or with a significant decline in fair value from the prior review 
the company also performs a periodic credit risk assessment for each of its asset backed securities under a systematic methodology  with the exception of investments backed by us government agency securities 
the methodology employs a risk driven approach  whereby securities are assigned to risk classes based on internally defined criteria 
the risk classes drive the frequency of the review  with investments in the highest risk class reviewed monthly 
in assessing an investment with impairment indicators for other than temporary impairment  the company evaluates the facts and circumstances specific to the investment  including  but not limited to  the following evaluation of current and future cash flow performance  reason for decline in the fair value of the investment  actual default rates of underlying collateral  subordination available as credit protection on the company s investment in a securitized transaction  credit rating downgrades on both the company s investment and the underlying collateral to the investment  extent of unrealized loss and the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position  failure of structured investments to meet minimum coverage or collateralization tests  
table of contents new information regarding the investment or the issuer  deterioration in the market  industry or geographical area relevant to the issuer or underlying collateral  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to either receive all contractual cash flows or for the investment to recover to its amortized cost 
as the company has an available for sale investment portfolio and generally does not utilize our portfolio for liquidity purposes  the company believes that our intent and ability to hold an investment along with the ability of the investment to generate cash flows are the primary factors in assessing whether an investment in an unrealized loss position is other than temporarily impaired 
if the company no longer has the intent or ability to hold the investment to maturity or call  and it is probable that the investment will not provide all of its contractual cash flows  then the company believes an investment in an unrealized loss position is other than temporarily impaired 
in assessing the company s intent and ability  the company evaluates our needs under regulatory and contractual requirements  changes to our investment strategy and anticipated cash flow needs  including any anticipated customer contract terminations 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used as part of our risk management strategy to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendments and interpretations 
the derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  with the change in fair value recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify  or is not designated  as a hedge will be reflected at fair value  with changes in value recognized through earnings 
the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using available market information and certain valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
as of december   moneygram had million of unrealized losses on derivative financial instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
while moneygram intends to continue to meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring or did not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
moneygram does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its hedging activities as the counterparties are generally well established  well capitalized financial institutions 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of moneygram s reporting units 
the fair value of moneygram s reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
if the growth rate for the company s reporting units with goodwill assigned decreases by basis points from the growth rates used in the valuation  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the discount rate for the company s reporting units with goodwill assigned increases by basis points from the growth rates used in the valuation  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged

moneygram s asset allocation at december  consists of approximately percent in large capitalization and international equity stock funds  approximately percent in fixed income securities  such as global bond funds and corporate obligations  approximately percent in a real estate limited partnership interest and approximately percent in other securities 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
some of these assumptions require significant management judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligation 
future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in moneygram s pension plans 
the discount rates used to determine benefit obligation and pension expense are reviewed on an annual basis 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would have increased pension expense by million  while increasing the discount rate by basis points would have decreased pension expense by million 
moneygram s pension assets are primarily invested in marketable securities that have readily determinable current market values

moneygram reviews the expected rate of return in connection with significant changes in the pension asset 
table of contents allocation  the investing strategy or in inflation and interest rates 
the actual rate of return on average pension assets in was percent  as compared to the expected rate of return of percent 
as the expected rate of return is a long term assumption and the widely accepted capital market principle is that assets with higher volatility generate greater long term returns  we do not believe that the actual return for one year is significantly different from the expected return used to determine the benefit obligation 
changing the expected rate of return by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million 
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes 
income before taxes is adjusted for various differences between tax law and generally accepted accounting principles 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the income tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the applicable enacted statutory tax rates 
management assesses the likelihood whether net deferred tax assets will be realized based on the weight of available evidence 
to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established in the period in which the determination is made 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the statement of operations 
the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
 on january  fin no 
requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  as applicable 
prior to the spin off  income taxes were determined on a separate return basis as if moneygram had not been eligible to be included in the consolidated income tax return of viad and its affiliates 
subsequent to the spin off  moneygram is considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting successor to viad and the continuing business of viad is referred to as new viad 
as part of the spin off  the company entered into a tax sharing agreement with viad which provides for  among other things  the allocation between moneygram and new viad of federal  state  local and foreign tax liabilities and tax liabilities resulting from the audit or other adjustment to previously filed tax returns 
although we believe that we have appropriately proportioned such taxes between viad and us  subsequent adjustments may occur upon filing of amended returns or resolution of audits by various taxing authorities
