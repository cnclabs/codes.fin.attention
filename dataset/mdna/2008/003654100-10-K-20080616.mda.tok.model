these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of medical devices in circulatory support and we offer a continuum of care in heart recovery to acute heart failure patients 
our strategy is focused on establishing heart recovery as the goal for all acute cardiac attacks 
our products are designed to enable the heart to rest  heal and recover by improving blood flow and or performing the pumping function of the heart 
we believe we are the only company with commercially available cardiac assist devices approved for heart recovery from all causes by the us food and drug administration  or fda and our products have been used to treat thousands of patients to date 
our products can be used in a broad range of clinical settings  including by heart surgeons for patients in profound shock and by interventional cardiologists for patients who are in pre shock or in need of prophylactic support in the cardiac catheterization lab  or cath lab 
we are focused on increasing awareness of heart recovery and establishing it as the goal for patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts 
we expect recovery awareness and utilization of our products will significantly increase the number of patients able to return home from the hospital with their own hearts 
since  our executive team has focused our efforts on expanding our product portfolio and we have numerous circulatory care disposable products that have either been approved or cleared by the fda or have received ce mark approval in europe  as well as several additional circulatory care products in development 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  financial instruments  accrued expenses  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets and investments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we also follow the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables when transactions include multiple elements 
revenue from product sales to new customers is deferred until training on the use of the products has occurred 
all costs related to product shipment are recognized at time of shipment 
we do not provide for rights of return to customers on product sales 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
in limited instances  we rent console medical devices on a month to month basis or for a longer specified period of time to customers for which revenue is recognized as earned 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed 
under contracts in which we elect to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  we prospectively recognize revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred 

table of contents intangible assets we estimate the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
the net book value of intangible assets at march  was million 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  delays in regulatory approval  other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of october  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
although such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
warranties our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
although we have established extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  we record a warranty obligation related to anticipated product failure rates and product recalls 
our consoles are covered by a one year limited manufacturer s warranty 
we estimate and record a warranty obligation in cost of revenue at the time of shipment and we record any additional amounts when we determine that such costs are probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
historically  our warranty provision has not been substantial  however  our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of any product failures  including product recalls  exceeds our estimated warranty provision 
inventories we value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down to its net realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected demand  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
we recorded write downs of inventory in the amount of million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as fees of attorneys and accountants  fees of investigators in conjunction with clinical trials and third party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of our product and product candidates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances 

table of contents stock based compensation in fiscal  in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment  we began recording stock based compensation in our statements of operations based on the fair value method  rather than the intrinsic method 
this expense is determined after consideration of several significant judgments and estimates 
the fair value of each stock option we granted is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of a valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of our stock 
the average expected life was estimated using the simplified method for stock option grants before january  as prescribed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
share based payment 
the calculation of the fair value of the options is net of estimated forfeitures 
beginning with the quarter ended march   we estimated the average expected life based on historical experience of our option exercises 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures  adjusted to the extent historic forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because we do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
prior to april   we accounted for stock based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles bulletin apb no 
we followed the disclosure only alternative requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value at the date of the grant 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at march   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal additionally  at march   we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal we acquired impella  a german based company  in may impella had pre acquisition net operating losses of approximately million at the time of acquisition which is denominated in euros and is subject to foreign exchange remeasurement at each balance sheet date presented  and has since incurred net operating losses in each fiscal year since the acquisition 
during fiscal  we determined that approximately million of pre acquisition net operating losses could not be utilized 
the utilization of pre acquisition nols of impella in future periods is subject to certain statutory approvals and business requirements 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets  a full valuation allowance of million has been established to offset our net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol and research and development credit carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future 
ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  can limit the amount of nol carry forwards and research and development credit carry forwards that a company can use each year to offset future taxable income and taxes payable 
we completed a section study and analysis in fiscal to determine whether changes in the composition of its stockholders  including our acquisition of impella or our recent public offering  resulted in an ownership change for purposes of section we believe that all of our federal and state nol s will be available for carryforward to future tax periods  subject to the statutory maximum carryforward limitation of any annual nol 
any future potential limitation to all or a portion of the nol or research and development credit carry forwards  before they can be utilized  would reduce our gross deferred tax assets 
we will monitor subsequent ownership changes  which could impose limitations in the future 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
or fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we adopted effective april  fin no 
addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
financial instruments we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement with world heart corporation  or worldheart  in december under the agreement  we loaned million to worldheart  with the note and accrued interest  at per annum  convertible at our option into common stock of worldheart 
we advanced million of the loan in december with the remaining million advanced in january 
table of contents the conversion feature within the note is an embedded derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and  accordingly  is separately valued within the carrying value of the note receivable 
we also received a warrant to purchase up to  shares of worldheart common stock 
the grant date fair values of the assets associated with the note receivable and the warrant  in excess of cash paid were deemed to be deferred income  as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
similar to other loan fees  the deferred income related to grant date fair value of the note receivable and the warrant will be recognized over the life of the note receivable  if deemed to be realizable as a yield adjustment 
we record these derivative financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded as change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant in the consolidated statements of operations 
the measurement of fair value is based on valuation methodologies considered appropriate by our management 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative and warrant has been determined using the black scholes method 
because of inherent uncertainty of valuations of derivative instruments  estimated fair values may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed  and these differences could have a material impact in the consolidated statements of operations 
we monitor our investment in the note receivable and warrant on a quarterly basis to determine whether any impairment is required 
we consider available evidence  including the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  if applicable  to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the carrying value of the financial instruments will be written down to estimated realizable value 
in may  worldheart filed a form k disclosing that it has limited cash available to continue operations and that if it is unable to secure additional funding  it will be forced to take extraordinary business measures which could include filing for bankruptcy  ceasing operations and liquidating assets 
we have a security interest in worldheart s intellectual property and other assets under the terms of the loan agreements 
however  in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of worldheart  there may not be a market for these assets  in which case we may not be able to receive payment for our convertible note 
due to these events  we recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal related to our note receivable from worldheart and its associated derivative instruments 
worldheart may be unsuccessful in raising additional funds to finance its operations and may become insolvent as a result 
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of worldheart  there may not be a market for these assets  in which case the company may not be able to receive payments for our convertible note

table of contents fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenues total revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal our revenues are primarily from sales of medical products for heart recovery 
product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal revenues from disposables  service and other products non console revenues comprised approximately and of total revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  revenues from impella disposables increased  ab disposables revenue increased and revenues from bvs declined approximately 
the impella disposables revenue increase is due to revenue recognized during our fiscal year from products used for the us pivotal studies for the impella device  as well as higher sales of the impella in europe 
we also recorded million in revenue during our fourth quarter of fiscal from sales of the abiocor total replacement heart 
comparing total revenues for fiscal to fiscal  total sales of our impella products consoles and disposables increased approximately  total sales of our ab products consoles and disposables decreased approximately  and total sales of our bvs products declined by approximately 
total console revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  due to declines in ab console revenues  partially offset by sales outside the us of ipulse and impella consoles 
our new ipulse combination console combination driver for our iab  bvs blood pump and ab ventricular assist device is approved under ce mark in europe and was approved by the fda under a pma supplement approval in late december the increase in revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the effects of our strategy to increase global distribution and our ongoing efforts to increase recovery awareness globally in hospitals  open heart centers and transplant centers 
our sales and clinical teams are focused on stimulating demand for our products by educating surgeons and cardiologists about both the clinical benefits of recovery and the increased reimbursement available for our heart recovery products 
we expect to continue to increase our marketing  service and training  investments throughout fiscal with particular focus on expertise in the cath lab to support the efforts of the sales and clinical teams to drive recovery awareness and revenue growth globally 
the bvs product was launched over years ago and revenue from this product has been declining as ab  our next generation product for heart recovery  is designed to provide a longer duration of support than the bvs and facilitates patient mobility in the hospital 
we expect revenue from bvs to continue to decline as our ab disposable revenue grows and also as our new impella products are introduced in the us the impella has been approved by the fda for two pivotal studies in the us in june  we received k clearance for our impella device for partial circulatory support for up to six hours 
this clearance allows for immediate commercial shipment of the device to us hospitals that purchase the device 
the impella  impella and impella ld are approved in europe under ce mark and are now approved in over countries 
during the us pivotal studies for the impella  we are generating revenue from the sale of impella disposables 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal this was due to an increase in cost of sales of disposable products as more of these products were sold in fiscal compared fiscal partially offset by lower cost of sales for consoles as console revenue declined in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we recorded cost of product revenues for product shipped during fiscal in connection with the impella us pivotal studies and recently approved abiocor product in which we had no product sales in fiscal cost of product revenues also was negatively impacted during fiscal from materials  training and other expenses related to our strategic capacity ramp up of impella and ab console deployment programs 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million for a write off of inventory 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal and included and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella and us trials 
our increase in product development costs reflect our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines across a clinical spectrum of circulatory care  particularly due to increased clinical trial activity on impella 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to increased investments in our global distribution of sales and clinical representatives with headcount up approximately as compared to fiscal  and is also due to our increased investments in our marketing initiatives 
we continue to invest in our european operations to generate revenue growth in that region and recently opened sales offices in france and the united kingdom 
we are investing in our global distribution to generate revenue growth of products that are approved by the fda and other global regulatory authorities today and also in advance of potential fda approvals of our impella products to maximize our market penetration and revenue growth following regulatory approval or clearance 
we expect to continue to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities throughout fiscal  with particular investments in clinical personnel with cath lab expertise and also plan to increase our marketing  service and training investments to support the efforts of the sales and clinical teams to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients globally 
arbitration decision in may  richard a 
nazarian  as selling stockholder representative  filed a demand for arbitration subsequently amended with the american arbitration association 
the claims arose out of our purchase of intellectual property rights relating to the penn state heart program and the related warrant agreements 
in november  we paid the warrant holders million of cash consideration to repurchase the warrants and in final settlement to release us of all potential claims by the warrant holders 
the excess of the million of cash consideration over the million estimated fair value of the warrants at october  was recorded as selling  general and administrative expense in the statements of operations during fiscal we expect that there will be no other future payments to warrant holders relating to this arbitration decision 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets was million for both fiscal and amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant we mark to market the fair value of the conversion feature on the note receivable and warrant associated with the worldheart transaction 
in may  worldheart filed a form k disclosing that it has limited cash available to continue operations and that if it is unable to secure additional funding  it will be forced to take extraordinary business measures which could include filing for bankruptcy  ceasing operations and liquidating assets 
we have a security interest in worldheart s intellectual property and other assets under the terms of the agreement 
due to these events  we recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal related to our note receivable from worldheart and its associated derivative instruments 
worldheart may be unsuccessful in raising additional funds to finance its operations and may become insolvent as a result 
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of worldheart there may not be a market for these assets  in which case we may not be able to receive payments for our convertible note 
investment income  net investment income  net  was million for fiscal  representing an increase of million from million for fiscal due primarily to a higher cash and investments balance during fiscal compared to fiscal investment income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and investments less million in realized losses associated with our columbia fund for fiscal also included in investment income  net  is an unrealized loss on short term marketable securities of million incurred during fiscal due to a write down to fair value of securities we hold in the columbia fund 
we deemed that the unrealized loss on the columbia fund was not temporary as the market value of the columbia fund was approximately of its carrying value 
other expense income the decrease in other income for fiscal was due to foreign exchange effects of million and miscellaneous income 
provision for income taxes during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in each year 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but 
table of contents not amortized for book purposes 
differences between amounts recorded as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet versus amounts recorded in the statements of operations are due to an unrealized gain from fluctuations in foreign currency with respect to our european operations 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against the company s deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased selling  general and administrative expenses of million related to the expansion of our global distribution and an increase of million in research and development expenses for costs of our impella us pivotal studies 
included in the net loss for fiscal is a million charge relating to the change in value of the worldheart note receivable and warrant  million charge relating to the arbitration award and warrant repurchase and million for the unrealized loss on marketable securities 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we plan to invest in expanding our global distribution to drive revenue growth and as we invest in research and development and our impella pivotal studies to bring impella and other new products to market 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenues total revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal our revenues are primarily from sales of medical products for heart recovery 
product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal revenues from disposables  service and other products non console revenues comprised approximately and of total revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  revenues from impella disposables increased  ab disposables revenue increased and revenues from bvs declined approximately 
comparing total revenues for fiscal to fiscal  total sales of our impella products consoles and disposables increased approximately  total sales of our ab products consoles and disposables increased approximately  and total sales of our bvs products declined by approximately 
in summary  the increase in fiscal revenues compared to fiscal year is primarily due to higher volume from our impella and ab products  partially offset by declines in sales of our bvs products during the period 
the dollar increase in revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the effects of our strategy to increase global distribution and our ongoing efforts to increase recovery awareness globally in hospitals  open heart centers and transplant centers 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased million or  to million from million for fiscal in fiscal  utilization of our german manufacturing capacity was higher than it was in fiscal additionally  the lower cost of goods sold from disposable products offset increased cost of goods sold from consoles  and our erp implementation in july resulted in improved efficiencies that lowered cost of goods sold during fiscal compared to fiscal the aggregate effect of these factors resulted in cost of goods sold during fiscal being approximately flat as compared to fiscal  and decreasing as a percentage of product revenue as compared to fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal included stock compensation expense of million and clinical trial expenses associated with our impella and pilot trials of million 
our increases in product development costs reflect our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines across a clinical spectrum of care in the cath lab and surgery suite 
during fiscal  we invested in new product development to broaden our portfolio of products in the circulatory care markets and incurred expenditures related to clinical trials  including pilot trials for our impella products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase is due primarily to increased costs of million associated with our strategy to increase our global distribution  
table of contents specifically our global sales  marketing and clinical specialist organizations 
total global sales and clinical headcount at the end of fiscal was compared to at the end of fiscal  representing an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal also included million of stock based compensation expense  costs associated with our erp implementation and increased professional fees 
expensed in process research and development expenses we recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended june  in connection with the acquisition of certain circulatory care device patents and know how 
this charge relates to costs to acquire in process research and development projects and technologies  which had not reached technological feasibility at the date of the asset acquisition and had no alternative future use 
we recorded a million non cash charge to in process research and development expense during the quarter ended june  in connection with our acquisition of impella in may this charge relates to costs to acquire in process research and development projects and technologies  which had not reached technological feasibility at the date of the business acquisition and had no alternative future use 
other expense income other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and investments 
other income  net  was million for fiscal  representing a decrease of million from million for fiscal the decrease in other income  net is primarily driven by lower investment income as a result of cash used in operations throughout the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes as of march   we have accumulated a net deferred tax liability in the amount of million which is primarily the result of a difference in accounting for our goodwill associated with the acquisition of impella which is amortized over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets under us generally accepted accounting principles since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
for fiscal  we have recorded a deferred tax provision related to amortization of goodwill in the amount of million 
differences between amounts recorded as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet versus amounts recorded in the statements of operations result from deferred tax adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations 
other than this provision  we have not recorded an income tax benefit on our operating loss because it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share  including the effects of stock based compensation expense 
this compares to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year which represents a decrease in net loss of million 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased revenue of million and million in decreases of acquired in process research and development  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the expansion of our global distribution and an increase of million in research and development expenses to expand our portfolio of circulatory care products 
included in the amounts reflected above for fiscal is stock based compensation expense of million  or approximately per share  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash and short term marketable securities and other investments totaled million  a decrease of million compared to million in cash and short term marketable securities at march  this does not include million of restricted cash recorded in other assets at march  we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we are also evaluating financing alternatives to potentially supplement our existing cash and investments including potentially securing a revolving line of credit 
short term marketable securities at march  consist of million in the columbia fund  million in four funds that invest in us backed government securities and million in interest receivable 
in december  the columbia fund ceased accepting redemption requests from new or current investors and changed its method of valuing the securities in the columbia fund to market value rather than amortized cost 
as a result  we reclassified the securities in the columbia fund from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities as the columbia fund was no longer expected to have a maturity of less than days 
we recorded a realized loss of million and an unrealized loss of million on short term marketable securities in the statements of operations for the year ended march  we deemed that the unrealized loss on the columbia fund was not temporary as the market value of the columbia fund was approximately

we apply the disclosure provisions of fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  and interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation 
table of contents no 
 or fin no 
to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions expand those required by sfas no 
by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at march  clinical study agreements in our clinical study agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement  the protocol for the device and our instructions 
the indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in our clinical study agreements 
product warranties we accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of shipment 
all of our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
under the provisions of fin no 
 intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments certain of our outstanding non derivative financial instruments at march  are subject to interest rate risk  but not subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the conversion feature and warrant associated with our note receivable from worldheart were determined to be derivative financial instruments 
we mark to market these instruments on a quarterly basis  utilizing various assumptions and modeling techniques 
we monitor our investment in the note receivable and warrant on a quarterly basis to determine whether any impairment is required 
we consider available evidence  including the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  if applicable  to evaluate the extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the carrying value of the financial instruments will be written down to estimated realizable value 
we recorded an impairment charge during fiscal writing down our million investment in worldheart 
as such the carrying value of the note receivable and warrant is zero at march  we do not participate in any other derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
primary market risk exposures our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists primarily of money market funds  us government backed securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds with maturities of one year or less at march  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in high investment grade securities as well as investment portfolio diversification 
our short term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
short term marketable securities at march  consist of million in the columbia fund  million in four funds that invest in us backed government securities and million in interest receivable 
in december  the columbia fund ceased accepting redemption requests from new or current investors and changed its method of valuing the securities in the columbia fund to market value rather than amortized cost 
as a result  we reclassified the securities in the columbia fund from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities as the columbia fund was no longer expected to have a maturity of less than days 
we recorded a realized loss of million and an unrealized loss of million on short term marketable securities in the statements of operations for the year ended march  we deemed that the unrealized loss on the columbia fund was not temporary as the market value of the columbia fund was approximately of its carrying value 
the columbia fund is being liquidated with distributions to us occurring and expected to be fully liquidated during calendar since december  we have received disbursements of approximately 
table of contents million from the columbia fund 
while it is our intent to liquidate securities in the columbia fund in future periods to reduce our exposure to future deterioration of these securities  we believe that operating results and cash flows could be affected significantly by market value adjustments to the columbia fund 
there can be no assurance that we will not have to take additional losses on the columbia fund 
currency exchange rates our germany subsidiary s functional currency is the euro 
therefore  our investment in our germany subsidiary is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
had a depreciation in the euro occurred relative to the us dollar as of march   the result would have been a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  accounts receivable  note receivable  accounts payable and warrant 
the estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
considerable judgment is required  however  to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
