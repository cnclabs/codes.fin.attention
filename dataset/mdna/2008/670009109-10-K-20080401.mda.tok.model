this discussion should be read in conjunction with noven and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this form k 
executive summary the following executive summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations appearing in this item as well as in our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our financial results for include the results of operations of jds from the date of acquisition august  through december  jds  now known as noven therapeutics  is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused in psychiatry and women s health  with a targeted sales force  psychiatry cns expertise  two marketed products  and a pipeline of new products in development 
the jds acquisition was an important part of noven s transition from primarily a transdermal drug delivery company to an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company 
our financial results for also include i a one time million charge recorded in the third quarter for the jds acquisition purchase price allocated to in process research and development ipr d  ii a million charge recorded in the third quarter related to payments to shire in connection with the voluntary withdrawal of a portion of daytrana product in the trade channel  and iii an aggregate million charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to separation arrangements associated with the retirement of certain executive officers  including robert c 
strauss  who retired from the position of president  chief executive officer and chairman effective january  including the impact of these substantial charges  we reported a net loss of million loss per share for  compared to net income of million diluted earnings per share for our net revenues in were million  an increase of compared to million reported in this increase reflects the recognition of million in net revenues associated with our sales of pexeva and lithobid products through noven therapeutics  a full year of sales of daytrana product  higher sales of our vivelle dot estrogen patch  and higher license revenues due to the amortization of additional daytrana sales milestones 
gross margin  as a percentage of product sales  was in compared to in gross margin in benefited primarily from higher overall product revenues  greater manufacturing facility utilization  and the continuing benefit of cost reductions implemented in the third quarter of gross margin in also benefited from a gross margin percentage on sales of noven therapeutics products 
daytrana gross margin was negatively affected in by production and yield issues  a portion of the withdrawal costs referenced above  and increased quality assurance activities and costs 
research and development expenses for increased to million  primarily due to higher clinical research activities at noven transdermals and to million in research and development expenses at noven therapeutics 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the addition of million in noven therapeutics expenses  of which is selling and marketing related  million in employee separation charges in the fourth quarter  million in expenses associated with the voluntary market withdrawal of a portion of daytrana product in the third quarter of  and a million increase in professional fees 

table of contents we recognized million in earnings from novogyne in  an increase of compared to net revenues at novogyne increased to million in  primarily due to increased sales of vivelle dot 
novogyne s gross margin percentage for increased slightly to 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to a million increase in sample expenses 
novogyne s net income for increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
at december   noven had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  and million in other investments non current 
this compares with million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments at december  the net decrease primarily reflects the payment of million in the acquisition of jds pharmaceuticals  tax payments of million  and million used in the third quarter to purchase shares under noven s share repurchase program  partially offset by the receipt of an aggregate million in daytrana sales milestone payments  million in distributions received from novogyne  and million received from shire in connection with noven s amphetamine patch development program 
noven s investments at december   consisted of million in auction rate securities  million of which have been classified as non current on noven s consolidated balance sheet following failed auctions occurring since mid february total prescriptions for vivelle dot increased in compared to  and total prescriptions for novogyne s products  taken as a whole  increased 
by comparison  the overall us ht market declined for the same period 
total prescriptions for daytrana launched in june increased in the first full year of sales compared to  while prescriptions for adhd stimulant therapies as a class increased in compared to comparing the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter  daytrana prescriptions increased  while prescriptions for the class increased for the same period 
the market share of daytrana remained substantially unchanged during reflecting ongoing generic substitution  total prescriptions for lithobid decreased in compared to total prescriptions for pexeva increased in compared to  while for the same period prescriptions for the selective serotonin re uptake inhibitor ssri class increased 

table of contents overview of noven and our novogyne joint venture our transdermal business is focused on developing advanced transdermal patches 
we presently derive the majority of our transdermal revenues from sales of transdermal patches for use in menopausal ht 
in the united states  our ht products are marketed and sold by novogyne pharmaceuticals  the joint venture that we formed with novartis in our business  financial condition and results of operations are significantly dependent upon novogyne and its marketing of our ht products in the united states 
a discussion of novogyne s results of operations and their impact on our results can be found under the caption results of operations equity in earnings of novogyne 
in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan  we have licensed the marketing rights to these products to novartis pharma  which is an affiliate of novartis 
we hold a equity interest in novogyne  and novartis holds the remaining equity interest 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  we manufacture and supply our ht products to novogyne  perform marketing  sales and promotional activities  and receive royalties from novogyne based on novogyne s sales of the estrogen therapy et products 
novartis distributes vivelle dot and combipatch and provides certain other services to novogyne  including financial and accounting functions 
novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return from novogyne  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
after the annual preferred return to novartis  our share of novogyne s income increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
our share of novogyne s income was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the income we recognize from novogyne is a non cash item 
any cash we receive from novogyne is in the form of cash distributions declared by novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  the amount of cash that we receive from novogyne in any period is typically not the same as the amount of income we recognize from novogyne for that period 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in distributions from novogyne  which  in addition to the daytrana milestone payments received from shire  accounted for a substantial portion of our net cash flows generated by operating activities for these periods 
we expect that for the next several years a substantial portion of our earnings will be generated through our interest in novogyne and a substantial portion of our cash flow will also be generated through our interest in novogyne in addition to any milestone payments we may receive from shire 
any failure by novogyne to remain profitable or to continue to make distributions would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
overview of noven therapeutics noven therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical company that currently markets two branded prescription psychiatry products and is advancing several developmental products in psychiatry and women s health 
we will seek to leverage noven therapeutics marketing and sales infrastructure with next generation psychiatry cns products  and with complementary products that we will seek to develop and or acquire 
noven therapeutics currently marketed products consist of pexeva  an ssri antidepressant indicated for major depressive disorder  panic disorder  obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder 

table of contents lithobid  an extended release lithium product  is the only branded lithium product sold in the united states 
lithobid is indicated for the maintenance of bipolar disorder and the treatment of related manic episodes 
in addition to marketing and selling these branded products  noven therapeutics is advancing a pipeline of therapeutic products in development  including stavzor  a proprietary enteric coated soft gelatin capsule delivery system for use in the treatment of bipolar disorder and epilepsy and in migraine therapy that we expect to launch in the second half of  lithium qd  a once daily lithium product under development and mesafem  a non hormonal therapy for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause that is under development 
to bring noven therapeutics pipeline of products under development to market  we plan to increase our research and development expenses significantly beginning in see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook 
certain items that may affect historical or future comparability set forth below are certain items that may affect the historical or future comparability of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
such disclosure is not intended to address every item that may affect the historical or future comparability of our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and such disclosure should be read in conjunction with the discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and outlook appearing elsewhere in this item acquisition of jds pharmaceuticals  llc in we acquired jds on august  the closing date 
the total purchase price for the jds acquisition consisted of million cash paid at closing  approximately million of transaction costs consisting primarily of fees paid for financial advisory  legal  valuation and accounting due diligence services  and approximately million in connection with non competition agreements entered into with two executives of jds in connection with the acquisition 
we funded the acquisition from the sale of short term investments 
we accounted for the acquisition of jds using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price exceeded the amounts allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by approximately million  which has been recorded as goodwill  all of which is deductible for tax purposes 
the primary factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill in our acquisition of jds are the intellectual capital of the skilled sales and marketing personnel and an organized experienced pharmaceutical sales force that is leveragable  neither of which meet the criteria for recognition as an asset separate from goodwill 
the total purchase price for the acquisition has been allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the closing date  which increased our assets and liabilities on the closing date as follows amounts in thousands 
table of contents current assets  including cash of million property and equipment intangible assets acquired in process research and development identifiable intangible assets goodwill other assets accrued expenses and other current liabilities long term obligation assumed contingent milestones assumed total purchase price as noted in the table above  million of the purchase price has been allocated to ipr d  which was charged to operations immediately following the completion of the acquisition in the ipr d expense resulted in a significant loss in the million in identifiable intangible assets relates to i intellectual property rights associated with noven therapeutics products approved by the fda  ii favorable lease intangible asset  and iii non competition agreements with two former executives of jds 
at december   the carrying amount of noven s intangible assets excluding goodwill  but including certain patent development costs unrelated to the jds acquisition totaled million 
noven estimates that the annual amortization expense for intangible assets held at december  for each of the five years through will be as follows amounts in thousands years ending december  cost of goods sold intellectual property selling  general and administrative non competition agreements favorable lease total we are required to test our intangible assets with indefinite lives  including our goodwill  for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
we are required to test our intangible assets with finite lives if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if after testing the intangible assets and goodwill  we determine that these assets are impaired  then we would be required to write down the impaired asset to fair value in the period when the determination is made 
the assumed long term obligation of million was paid in based on an analysis of favorable early payment discount 
the million contingent milestones assumed are for contingent sales milestones related to jds acquisition of pexeva from synthon  which are payable upon the achievement of specified future sales levels of the product 

table of contents daytrana we have received reports from some consumers concerning the difficulty of removing the release liner from daytrana patches 
in the first quarter of  we  together with shire  implemented enhancements to the daytrana release liner intended to improve ease of use of the patch 
while the enhanced release liner has reduced the level of consumer reports  we continue to seek further enhancements to the daytrana release liner to improve the ease of use of the patch 
throughout daytrana s market share has remained substantially unchanged 
in july  we received from the fda a list of observations on form following an on site inspection of our manufacturing facilities 
the majority of the observations in the form related to the daytrana patch and difficulties experienced by some patients in removing the release liner  including certain product lots that utilize the enhanced release liner 
in july  we submitted to the fda our response to the form in the third quarter of  shire initiated two voluntary market withdrawals of a portion of the daytrana product on the market primarily in response to feedback from patients and caregivers who experienced difficulty removing the release liner from some daytrana patches 
we paid shire million in february related to the withdrawals 
these costs were charged to operations in the third quarter of as follows i million was reflected as a reduction of revenues  ii million was recorded as an increase to cost of goods sold  and iii million was recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
in january  noven received a warning letter from the fda in connection with the fda s july inspection of our manufacturing facilities 
in the warning letter  the fda cites current good manufacturing practice deficiencies related to i peel force specifications for removal of daytrana s release liner  and ii data supporting the peel force characteristics of daytrana s enhanced release liner throughout the product s shelf life 
we submitted our response to the warning letter on january   however  no assurance can be given that our response will be acceptable to the fda or satisfactorily address the fda s concerns 
our business will be significantly harmed if we are unable to adequately resolve the issues raised by the fda in the warning letter as well as the production and other issues involving daytrana 
for a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing daytrana  please see the risk factor discussion beginning on page of this form k 

table of contents results of operations with the addition of noven therapeutics  our business is now comprised of two reportable segments distinguished along product categories i noven transdermals  which currently engages in the research  development  manufacturing and licensing to partners of transdermal drug delivery technologies and prescription transdermal products  including product sales to shire and novogyne as well as our equity in earnings of novogyne  and ii noven therapeutics  which currently engages in the development  marketing  sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
prior to the acquisition of jds on august   we operated exclusively in the transdermals segment 
following the acquisition  in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we began to separately report information for the therapeutics segment 
we currently evaluate segment performance based on segment contribution  which consists of segment gross margin less direct research and development expenses and direct selling expenses  plus in the case of transdermals our equity in earnings of novogyne 
corporate general and administrative expenses  interest income and the immediate expensing of acquired ipr d have not been allocated to our operating segments 
our results by segment are presented in the table below for the year ended december  the contribution of our transdermals segment includes the impact of million recognized as equity in earnings of novogyne 
the results of our therapeutics segment are from the closing date through december  the negative contribution of our therapeutics segment reflects the impact of significant selling and marketing expenses in support of noven therapeutics products and sales and marketing infrastructure  which infrastructure we expect to leverage in future periods through the commercialization of additional products

aggregate sales to novogyne increased primarily due to increased sales of vivelle dot 
in addition  revenues in benefited from the inclusion of million in pexeva and lithobid sales since august   the date of our acquisition of jds 
as described in more detail below  the increase in net revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to the june launch of daytrana  which contributed million to our product revenues and million to our license revenues in product revenues novogyne product revenues novogyne consists of our sales of vivelle dot  vivelle  estradot for canada and combipatch to novogyne at a fixed price for product sampling and resale by novogyne primarily in the united states  as well as the royalties we receive as a result of novogyne s sales of vivelle dot and vivelle 
for additional information on the components of product revenues novogyne as well as our other sources of revenues  see critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 

table of contents the million increase in product revenues from novogyne for as compared to primarily related to a million increase in sales of vivelle dot  of which million related to trade product sales due to increased prescription trends  million related to the timing of orders from novogyne for samples of vivelle dot and million related to a price increase 
royalties increased million due to increased sales by novogyne for revenues from novogyne in were relatively consistent with as noted below under novogyne net revenues  novogyne sells its products to trade customers  including wholesalers  distributors and chain pharmacies and the timing of orders by these customers is difficult to predict and can lead to significant variability in trade customers ordering patterns 
as a result  there may be significant period to period variability in novogyne s ordering patterns from noven 
product revenues third parties product revenues third parties consists of i sales of estradot  estalis and menorest hormone therapy patches to novartis pharma at a price based on a percentage of novartis pharma s net selling price subject to certain minima for resale primarily outside the united states and japan  together with royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada  ii sales of daytrana to shire for commercial resale in the united states  and iii beginning on august   noven s commercial sales of pexeva and lithobid to trade customers  including wholesalers  distributors and chain pharmacies 
the million increase in product revenues third parties for as compared to primarily related to million increase in volume sales of daytrana  the addition of million in pexeva and lithobid revenues and a million increase related to ht product pricing with novartis pharma 
daytrana product sales in were million compared to million in sales of daytrana commenced in the second quarter of the increase related to ht product pricing was primarily due to the recognition of a higher price reconciliation payment received from novartis pharma in as compared to noven records such payments from time to time upon novartis pharma s determination that its actual sales price of our product entitles us to receive amounts in excess of the minimum transfer price at which we initially sold the product to novartis pharma 
these increases were partially offset by declines of million and million in sales volume of menorest and femiest  respectively 
the decline in menorest is attributable to the continued transition from menorest to estradot  while we believe the decline in femiest is due to the timing of orders 
the million increase in product revenues from third parties for as compared to was primarily related to million in sales of daytrana  reflecting the initial product launch during this increase was partially offset by a million decline in the recognition of the price reconciliation payments received from novartis pharma 
volume increases of million and million for estradot and femiest  respectively  were offset by volume declines of million and million for estalis and menorest  respectively 
we believe the volume increases and declines were all related to the timing of orders  except for the decline in menorest  which was attributable to the continued transition from menorest to estradot 

table of contents license and contract revenues license revenues consist of the recognition of non refundable up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements 
contract revenues consist of the recognition of payments received as work is performed on research and development projects 
the payments received may take the form of non refundable up front payments  payments received upon the completion of certain phases of development work and success milestone payments 
license revenues increased million for as compared to  mostly attributable to an increase of million in amortization of milestone payments received from shire related to the license of daytrana 
the million increase reflects full year amortization of the million approval milestone compared to two quarters in  full year amortization of the million sales milestone received in the first quarter of as well as six months amortization of the million sales milestone received in the third quarter of in  we benefited from the recognition of million in deferred license revenues related to a one time non refundable payment from a third party 
contract revenues declined million for as compared to  primarily reflecting a decline in contract work performed 
license revenues increased million for as compared to primarily due to the recognition of million in amortization of milestone payments related to our daytrana license to shire and the recognition of a million one time non refundable payment from a third party for a license to certain of our patents  partially offset by million in license revenues recognized in related to our fentanyl agreement with endo pharmaceuticals  inc endo  the majority of which was recognized in the fourth quarter of due to the termination of the agreement with endo upon the fda s decision to cease review of our fentanyl patch application 
contract revenues declined million for as compared to due to a decline in contract work performed 

table of contents gross to net revenues we record revenues net of sales allowances for rebates  chargebacks  cash and other discounts  as well as sales returns allowances 
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of our gross revenues to net revenues for the three years ended december  for both noven transdermals and  for the period from august  to december   for noven therapeutics dollar amounts in thousands of gross of gross of gross revenues revenues revenues noven transdermals gross revenues sales returns allowances net revenues noven therapeutics gross revenues cash discounts medicaid  medicare state program rebates and credits including prescription drug saving cards  vouchers chargebacks wholesaler fees sales allowances sales returns sales and returns allowances net revenues sales returns allowances consist of changes in allowances for returns for product recalls and or products voluntarily withdrawn from the market for noven transdermals and changes in allowances for returns of expiring product for noven therapeutics 
during  sales returns allowances for noven transdermals increased million  primarily due to shire s voluntary market withdrawals of certain daytrana product 
gross margin this section discusses gross margins relating to our product revenues i across all of our products overall gross margin  ii on our transdermals product revenues from novogyne gross margin novogyne  which for accounting purposes is considered a related party  iii on our transdermals product revenues from third parties gross margin third parties  and iv on 
table of contents our therapeutics products 
product revenues from third parties include ht product sales to novartis pharma for resale primarily outside the united states and japan  as well as daytrana product sales to shire 
therapeutics product revenues include sales of pexeva and lithobid to trade customers starting on august  the allocation of overhead costs impacts our determination of gross margins for each of our products 
overhead costs  which were in excess of million in  include salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs  depreciation and amortization  and insurance costs and represent a substantial portion of our inventory production costs 
the allocation of overhead among our various products requires us to make significant estimates that involve subjective and often complex judgments 
using different estimates would likely result in materially different results for gross margin novogyne and gross margin third parties than are presented in the gross margin table below 
our gross margins are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands years ended december  noven transdermals novogyne product revenues cost of products sold gross profit third parties product revenues cost of products sold gross profit loss total noven transdermals product revenues cost of products sold gross profit noven therapeutics product revenues cost of products sold gross profit total company product revenues cost of products sold gross profit the year ended december  includes a million charge for inventory write offs and disposal costs following the fda s decision to cease review of our fentanyl patch anda 
excluding the impact of this charge  third party gross profit was million or  and total company gross profit was million or in gross profit excluding our fentanyl charge is a non gaap measure 
management uses this non gaap measure to evaluate our ongoing business and to meaningfully compare operating results between years 
we believe investors find this information useful for the same purpose 
gross profit excluding the fentanyl charge is not a substitute for gaap basis gross profit as presented in the table 

table of contents in general  noven therapeutics products have higher gross margins than our other products because we sell these products directly to trade customers at wholesale and commercial prices 
our sales of ht products to novogyne for resale in the united states have a higher gross margin than our other transdermal products  reflecting favorable pricing  larger production orders and other factors 
our sales of ht products to novartis pharma for resale in international markets generally have a lower gross margin than sales of ht products sold to novogyne due to  among other things  unfavorable pricing environments in foreign markets  and smaller production orders 
our gross margin on product sales of daytrana to shire has been negatively affected by the factors described below 
as noted in the tables above  overall gross margin improved significantly in compared to overall gross margin in benefited from the addition of our pexeva and lithobid products  which had net sales of million and related cost of products sold of million  resulting in a gross margin of for those products  significantly higher product revenues due to full year sales of daytrana  higher facility utilization for our transdermal products  which contributed to improved overhead absorption  cost savings associated with our cost reduction program initiated in the third quarter of  and a million increase in price reconciliation payments relating to international sales of our ht products for as compared to  which payments increase product revenues without increasing costs 
overall gross margin in was negatively affected by our gross margin on daytrana product sales 
we sell daytrana finished product to shire at a fixed cost  so our profit on product sales of daytrana depends on our ability to manufacture the product efficiently and to fully utilize our facilities 
for  daytrana product revenues were million which reflects a million adjustment in allowances for returns at noven related to the daytrana market withdrawal and cost of products sold related to daytrana was million  resulting in negative gross margin for the product 
daytrana gross margin was negatively affected in by yield issues and increased costs related to delays in obtaining a supply of the active methylphenidate ingredient ami during the year  quality assurance costs and the voluntary market withdrawals 
in  we expect to incur increased quality assurance costs related to our continued efforts to address the issues raised by the fda in the july form and january warning letter  and a significant portion of these continuing costs will be allocated to daytrana  which will negatively affect the gross margin on sales of this product in as noted in the tables above  excluding the fentanyl charge  overall gross margin declined significantly in as compared to during  our overall gross margin was materially and adversely affected by start up expenses associated with commencing production of daytrana  and production inefficiencies including lower than desired yields and increased costs associated with meeting critical launch timelines 
in addition  the cost of the ami used in the production of daytrana is not included in our daytrana product revenues or in our cost of products sold 
shire supplies us with ami for production of daytrana  and retains title to the ami 
under this arrangement  we bear certain risks of manufacturing loss related to ami and are obligated to reimburse shire for the cost of ami if our production yields do not meet certain minimum levels 
for  our cost of products sold included million in ami reimbursements to shire which negatively affected overall gross margin and gross margin third parties in for  daytrana product revenues were million  and cost of products sold related to daytrana was million  primarily reflecting the impact of the daytrana launch costs and the ami reimbursements 
to a lesser extent  overall gross margin in was also negatively affected by 
table of contents increased personnel and other resources dedicated to quality control in our ht operations and by lower production volume in our ht business due to the timing of orders 
our expectations for gross margins in future periods are addressed under outlook below 
operating expenses operating expenses are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands years ended december  change change research and development acquired in process research and development  n m selling  general and administrative n m not meaningful research and development research and development expense includes costs associated with  among other things  product formulation  pre clinical testing  clinical studies  regulatory and medical affairs  production of product for clinical and regulatory purposes  production related development engineering for developmental products  and the personnel associated with each of these functions 
the million increase in research and development expenses for as compared to was primarily due to a million increase in clinical research costs on developmental products for noven transdermals and million in noven therapeutics expenses since the closing date of the acquisition 
these increases in were partially offset by a million decline in development engineering expenses primarily related to daytrana prior to the product s launch in the second quarter of the million decline in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million decline in development engineering expenses related to our daytrana and fentanyl patches  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation  a million increase in personnel costs and a million increase in other costs associated with the development of other products 
acquired in process research and development as discussed above  we charged million to operations in representing the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d in our acquisition of jds 
this amount represents the value assigned to projects that have been initiated and achieved material progress but i have not yet reached technological feasibility or have not yet reached the appropriate regulatory approval  ii have no alternative future use  and iii the fair value is estimable with reasonable certainty 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for as compared to primarily due to the addition of million of noven therapeutics expenses since the closing date of the acquisition  primarily related to sales and marketing of pexeva and lithobid 
in addition  noven transdermals selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  due in part to a million increase in compensation expenses  of which million related to separation arrangements with certain executive officers 
also contributing to the increase was million in costs associated with the voluntary market withdrawals of daytrana and a million increase in professional fees 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to million in stock based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r in  a million increase in compensation expense primarily due to the addition of personnel in business development  strategic alliances and other key areas and a million charge associated with the elimination of employee positions as part of the cost reduction program we implemented in consulting costs increased million due to the timing of work performed on projects related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and to a lesser extent increased information management compliance costs 
other income and expenses interest income interest income increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash available for investment due to our receipt from shire of sales milestone payments of million in march and million in august these cash increases were partially offset by the million in cash consideration related to the jds acquisition  which decreased our cash available for investment in the third and fourth quarters of interest income increased million  or  in as compared to due to an increase in the average cash balance  which was primarily attributable to the million milestone payment received from shire in april in connection with the approval of our daytrana product as well as million received from the exercise of stock options 
in addition to higher average cash balances  we invested a higher portion of our cash in investments which primarily consist of investment grade  asset backed  variable debt obligations and municipal auction rate securities that yielded higher interest income 
we also benefited from an increase in interest rates in as compared to income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate for as compared to related primarily to a higher percentage of our income that was subject to state income taxes and lower tax free interest income as a percentage of our total loss due to the sale of investments for payment of the purchase price of our acquisition of jds and our ipr d expense related to the jds acquisition 

table of contents the provision for income taxes is based on the federal statutory and state income tax rates 
net deferred income tax assets are measured using the average graduated tax rate for the estimated amount of annual taxable income in the years that the liability is expected to be settled or the asset recovered 
the effect of adjusting the expected tax rate related to the net deferred income tax assets is included in the provision for income taxes 
the acquisition of jds resulted in a significant increase in our deferred income tax assets  primarily due to the fact that the million ipr d expense recognized in is not immediately deductible for tax purposes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million compared to million at december  realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
noven therapeutics files separate state income tax returns in states where it has determined that it is required to file state income taxes 
as a result  state deferred tax assets relating to noven therapeutics are evaluated separately in determining whether the state deferred tax assets are realizable 
we expect that noven therapeutics will incur taxable losses in the next few years due to future expected clinical trial expenditures related to product development 
these expected taxable losses create negative evidence indicating the need for a valuation allowance at december  we recorded a valuation allowance of million for the year ended december   due to uncertainties in realizing these state deferred tax assets based on our projection of future state taxable income 
if we determine  based on future noven therapeutics profitability that these state deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate income tax benefit in the period the valuation allowance is released 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for as compared to the prior year relates primarily to higher non taxable interest income as a percentage of taxable income 
this decreased tax rate was partially offset by higher taxable income in as compared to primarily due to the fentanyl charge in the prior year  non deductible stock based compensation expense related to incentive stock options that began in and certain credits and reductions for reserves for internal revenue service audits that occurred in that did not recur in equity in earnings of novogyne we share in the earnings of novogyne  after satisfaction of an annual preferred return of million to novartis  according to an established formula 
novogyne produced sufficient income in each of  and for us to recognize earnings from novogyne under the formula

as has historically been the case  the timing of purchases by trade customers is driven by the inventory needs of each customer and other factors  and does not necessarily track underlying prescription trends in any given period or coincide with novogyne s quarterly financial reporting periods 
as a result  the timing of orders by trade customers is difficult to predict and can lead to significant variability in novogyne s results  especially when comparing quarterly periods 
novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to by product  vivelle dot increased million while estradot  vivelle and combipatch declined million  million and million respectively 
the million vivelle dot increase consisted of an million increase related to pricing and a million increase from higher unit sales due to increased product demand and to the timing of orders 
the decline in estradot was attributable to the timing of orders 
the decline in vivelle  the first generation estrogen patch  is attributable to a million decline due to lower unit sales resulting from product maturity and the continuing market transition to vivelle dot  partially offset by a million increase related to pricing 
the decline in combipatch results from a million decrease due to lower unit sales as the market for combination therapies continues to decline  and the impact of a competitive product 
the combipatch decline was partially offset by a million increase related to pricing of the product 

table of contents novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to by product  the increase in novogyne s gross revenues reflects a million increase in sales of vivelle dot estradot  partially offset by a million and a million decline in sales of vivelle and combipatch  respectively 
the higher vivelle dot estradot sales were primarily attributable to an million increase from higher unit sales due to an increase in prescriptions as well as the timing of orders  and an million increase related to pricing 
vivelle  the first generation estrogen patch  declined by million due to lower unit sales resulting from product maturity and the planned discontinuation of the product  partially offset by a million increase related to pricing 
combipatch revenues declined million due to lower unit sales as a result of the continuing decline in the market for combination therapies as well as the impact of a competitive product 
this combipatch decline was partially offset by a million increase related to pricing of the product

table of contents current year provisions for returns of expiring product adjustment to prior year provisions for returns of expiring product benefits for returns for product recalls sales returns allowances actual returns for expiring product actual returns for product recalls total actual returns the decrease in sales returns allowances as a percentage of gross revenues for as compared to was primarily related to lower actual returns of combipatch in the current period 
the higher returns of combipatch in the prior period primarily related to returns of a superseded packaging configuration 
the increase in sales returns allowances as a percentage of gross revenues for as compared to was primarily due to higher than expected returns of vivelle dot as well as higher than expected returns of combipatch due to a superseded packaging configuration  which resulted in an increase of prior year provisions for returns of million 
in addition  benefited from a reduction in allowances of expiring product due to lower than expected returns as a result of a decline in actual returns of vivelle at the time 
novogyne gross margin the two percentage point gross margin increase for as compared to was primarily related to higher pricing  especially for vivelle dot  and to an aggregate decrease in sales returns allowances due to lower returns of combipatch 
novogyne s gross margin was consistent for as compared to novogyne selling  general and administrative novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for as compared to due to a million increase in sample expenses and a million increase in sales  marketing and advertising expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline in ht litigation expenses 
novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for as compared to  primarily due to a million increase in marketing  advertising and promotion expenses and a million increase in sample expenses primarily attributable to the timing of sample orders by novogyne

net cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to million in net purchases of short term investments  as well as the purchase of million in fixed assets to expand production capacity for future products 
beginning in the first quarter of  noven invested a portion of its cash in short term investments  which primarily consist of investment grade  asset backed  variable rate debt obligations and municipal auction rate securities  which are categorized as available for sale under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
net cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to million in net purchases of short term investments  as well as the purchase of million in fixed assets to expand production capacity for future products 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for was primarily attributable to the open market purchase of million of shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program established in the third quarter of and the payment of a million long term obligation assumed as part of the acquisition of jds 
these payments were offset by million received in connection with the issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of stock options 
in addition  benefited from million in excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in and was attributable to million and million  respectively  received as the exercise price paid by the option holders in connection with their exercises of stock options 
in addition  benefited from million in excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  which prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r was reported in operating activities 
short term and long term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash and short term investments  cash generated from product sales  milestones  fees and royalties under development and license agreements and distributions from novogyne 
our short term cash flow is significantly dependent on distributions from novogyne and sales  royalties and license fees associated with our products 
any material decrease in sales of those products by us or our licensees  a material decline in the ht market  the introduction of a generic version of vivelle dot  material increase in operating expenses  or the inability or failure of novogyne to pay distributions  would have a material adverse effect on our short term cash flow and 
table of contents require us to rely on our existing cash balances  investments  equity or debt offerings or on borrowings to support our operations and business 
although we expect to continue to receive distributions from novogyne  there can be no assurance that novogyne will have sufficient profits or cash flow to pay distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize such distributions 
our liquidity is also dependent on our receipt from shire of the third and final million milestone payment related to our daytrana patch 
to date  we have received million of the possible million related to the shire license of daytrana 
we cannot assure if or when we will receive the third milestone triggered upon shire s achievement of million in annual net sales of daytrana 
for the year ended december   we paid an aggregate million in taxes  of which approximately million relates to daytrana milestones received to date 
the majority of the income taxes related to the first and second sales milestones are expected to be paid in and into early we expect to increase our research and development expense significantly beginning in to fund our projects under development  including those for noven therapeutics 
we expect to fund the additional research and development expenses from our operating cash flows  existing cash and short term investments as well as the sources of funds described herein 
given our planned expenditures for research and development  sales and marketing and other operating items in  we generally expect that our cash  cash equivalents and other investments at year end will decrease from year end levels 
our liquidity may be significantly harmed if we are unable to adequately resolve the issues raised by the fda in the warning letter we received in january no assurance can be given that noven s response to the warning letter will be acceptable to the fda or satisfactorily address the fda s concerns 
failure to take effective corrective actions can result in fda enforcement action such as monetary fines  product recalls  injunctions  seizures  suspension of production or withdrawal of product approval 
any enforcement action by the fda would have a material adverse effect on noven  including the potential loss of daytrana sales  the potential loss of sales of other products  the potential inability to achieve the remaining daytrana sales milestone  the potential for litigation related to this matter  harm to our reputation and various costs associated with the foregoing 
we have invested a significant portion of our cash in auction rate securities  which subjects us to the liquidity risk described in part ii item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
subsequent to december   million of auction rate securities were liquidated through the auction process 
as of march  million of these investments were rolled over following failed auctions 
as a result of failed auctions  the auction rate securities could not be liquidated and pay interest at a maximum rate as defined by the governing documents or indenture 
due to uncertainty about when we will be able to liquidate these investments  we have reclassified all auction rate securities which have not been sold subsequent to december   as non current assets  as the availability of such funds is subject to market conditions that may continue for an indeterminable period of time 
we paid approximately million in cash to acquire jds and incurred approximately million in transaction related costs 
in addition  we assumed approximately million of accrued expenses and other current liabilities and assumed certain contractual arrangements whereby we may be required to pay to third parties up to million in product development and sales milestones that could become due over the next five years 
we funded the purchase price and related transaction expenses from our sale of short term investments 

table of contents our liquidity for the year ended december  benefited from million received as the exercise price paid by option holders in connection with their exercises of employee stock options 
we expect this amount to fluctuate from period to period depending on the performance of noven s common stock and equity award exercises 
beginning in  we began granting ssars to employees and restricted stock to non employee directors in lieu of stock options 
these types of awards do not provide cash to us upon their exercise 
accordingly  we expect that funds received from option exercises will decrease as a source of liquidity over time 
in we used million to repurchase a total of  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
we currently have no long term debt 
to the extent the sources of liquidity described herein are insufficient to fund our operations  including our anticipated increased research and development expenses  we would expect to undertake a debt and or equity financing as a source of liquidity 
we cannot provide any assurance that such financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory financing  we may be required to delay or reduce our proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development  plant and equipment and strategic acquisitions 
furthermore  debt financing would likely require us to devote funds to service and ultimately repay such debt and could be subject to financial or operational covenants that could limit or hinder our ability to conduct our business 
our strategic plan includes the acquisition of one or more products  technologies or businesses that we believe may be complementary to our business 
while our existing cash and investments may fund a portion of a strategic acquisition  we expect that we will be required to seek debt and or equity financing to complete such an acquisition 
we cannot provide any assurance that such financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
capital expenditures totaled million for we expect to fund our foreseeable capital expenditures from our operating cash flows  existing cash  short term investments and debt 
although subject to the liquidity risk for auction rate securities discussed above  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
to enhance our liquidity position  we are currently seeking a credit facility  although we cannot assure that we will successfully obtain a credit facility on favorable terms or at all 
if our transdermal products under development are successful  we expect that our cash requirements will increase to fund plant and equipment purchases to expand production capacity 
for our long term operating needs  we intend to utilize funds derived from the above sources 
to the extent available  we may use funds generated through sales of products under development and payments received pursuant to development and licensing arrangements 
if such funds are insufficient  we may rely on debt and or equity financing to fund such expansion 
we cannot assure that we will successfully complete the development of such products  that we will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product will be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that we will successfully negotiate future licensing or product acquisition arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development and expansion of manufacturing facilities is incurred prior to product launch  if we are unsuccessful in out licensing  or if we are unable to launch additional commercially viable products that we develop or that we license or acquire from others  we will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the cash generated by sales of those products  which could adversely affect our long term liquidity needs 
factors that 
table of contents could impact our ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed in part i item a risk factors of this form k 
for the years ended december   and  our equity in earnings of novogyne  the recognition of deferred license revenue and ipr d expense all of which are non cash items contributed significantly to our income loss before income taxes 
accordingly  our net income loss may not be reflective of our cash flow in any given period 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
aggregate contractual obligations the table below lists our significant contractual obligations as of december  amounts are in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligation deferred compensation obligation long term obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating leases for machinery  equipment  warehouse and office space

in the ordinary course of business  we enter into non cancelable purchase obligations to vendors to which we have submitted purchase orders  but have not yet received the goods or services 

table of contents outlook a summary of our current financial guidance is provided below 
our guidance includes certain items related to the impact on our financial results of our acquisition of jds pharmaceuticals now known as noven therapeutics  which we acquired in august  this financial guidance supersedes all financial guidance that we may have previously provided  any financial guidance previously provided in areas not addressed below  whether in prior filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  public conference calls or otherwise  is no longer current and is hereby withdrawn 
the forward looking information contained in this section is based on our current assumptions and expectations  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  for purposes of this guidance we have assumed that  during  there will not be any material acquisitions of products  companies  or technologies or other transactions  changes in noven s or novogyne s accounting or accounting principles or any of the estimates or judgments underlying our critical accounting policies  regulatory or technological developments  changes in the supply of  demand for  or distribution of our products including any changes resulting from competitive products  product recalls withdrawals  or new study results  negative actions with respect to our applications for methylphenidate quota or other disruptions in supplies of raw materials  adverse actions by the fda in connection with the january warning letter or otherwise  changes in our business relationships collaborations  or changes in the economy or the health care sector generally 
financial guidance is inherently uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will achieve results consistent with this guidance  and our actual financial results could differ materially from the expected results discussed below 
for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our actual financial results for the periods referenced  including additional risks and uncertainties related to noven therapeutics  readers should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and cautionary factors discussed in part i item a risk factors of this form k  as well as other reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
net revenues  gross margin  expenses  net income loss and other aspects of our financial results can vary substantially from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  including the timing of product orders by our licensees  the timing of release of manufactured product following quality control and quality assurance measures undertaken by noven and or its customers  the availability of raw materials  the timing of commencement of clinical studies  and other factors 
net revenues 
we expect total net revenues for full year to be in the million to million range  reflecting i a full year of sales of pexeva and lithobid  ii recognition of nominal revenues associated with the expected launch of stavzor in the second half of  reflecting the fact that  pursuant to applicable accounting rules  we expect to recognize stavzor revenues based on prescriptions filled as opposed to upon shipment to trade customers  iii an approximate increase in our daytrana net sales to shire compared to  iv higher license and contract revenues compared to due to the full year amortization of daytrana sales milestones received in  and v aggregate ht product sales by noven for sales in the us and international markets consistent with levels 
gross margin 
we expect our overall gross margin  as a percentage of product sales  to be in the range for full year among other factors influencing our gross margin on transdermal manufacturing operations  we expect to incur increased quality assurance costs related to our continued efforts to address the issues raised by the fda in the july form and january warning letter 
a significant portion of these costs will be allocated to daytrana  which will negatively affect the gross margin on sales of this product in we expect our cost of goods in 
table of contents to include approximately million in amortization associated with noven therapeutics commercialized products  which amount may vary depending on sales forecasts and other factors 
research and development expense 
we expect our consolidated research and development expense for full year to be in the mid million range 
estimates of research and development expenses for future periods are subject to substantial adjustment as each product advances through various stages of development 
selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect our consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for full year to be in the upper million range  including selling and promotional expenses in support of noven therapeutics existing products and the expected commercial launch of stavzor 
equity in earnings of novogyne 
we expect our equity in earnings of novogyne to increase in the range in compared to interest income 
we expect our interest income to decrease in compared to  primarily reflecting lower cash and investment balances following payment of the jds acquisition purchase price in august critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition as well as estimates related to product returns and sales allowances  the fair value of stock based compensation granted to employees and outside directors  as well as the net realizable value of our inventories and our deferred tax asset and our effective tax rate and the recoverability and fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain or which involve factors that may be beyond our control 
using different assumptions could result in materially different results 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows license revenues  multiple element arrangements and contract revenues license revenues include up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements 
these agreements may contain multiple deliverables  such as product development  technology licenses  contract research and development  and the manufacturing and supply of products 
we recognize license revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force 
table of contents eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  as applicable 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has standalone value to the customer  and whether there is objective  reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values or using the residual method  as appropriate  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are identified and applied to each of the units 
if multiple deliverables do not meet the separation criteria of eitf issue  they are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and management applies a revenue recognition method that best reflects the economic substance of the transaction 
in selecting the appropriate method to apply  management considers the specific facts and circumstances of each transaction  giving particular emphasis to the manner in which the customer receives the benefit of the transaction 
in general  revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees received prior to or upon product approval are deferred until the revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied and the customer begins to derive the value and benefits from the use of  or access to  the license 
our obligations generally are completed upon achieving regulatory approval of the licensed products  upon delivery of our development work  or when we have delivered a commercially viable license to our technology 
in multiple element arrangements where research and development work does not meet the separation criteria of eitf issue as has typically been the case for our agreements  our policy is to recognize such revenues over the product s estimated life cycle 
our arrangements generally culminate in the delivery to the licensee of technology licenses to market and sell products we have developed in a licensed territory 
consequently  applying the guidance of eitf issue  we have determined that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
furthermore  we have concluded that the most appropriate revenue attribution method is to defer license revenues and recognize them over the products estimated life cycles  as the customer derives the value from the use of  or access to  the license 
when we are unable to estimate the pattern of the expected economic benefits  the deferred revenues are amortized on a systematic and rational straight line basis over the product s estimated life cycle 
we evaluate the facts and circumstances surrounding achievement of nonrefundable sales milestones to ensure that revenue recognition represents the substance of the transaction 
substantive sales milestones are recognized as revenue when achieved based on the substance of the underlying transactions  when we have fulfilled all of our obligations relative to the milestone payments 
non substantive sales milestones are not recognized immediately as revenue when achieved  but are deferred and recognized as revenues over time in a manner that is consistent with the underlying facts and circumstances 
in determining the estimated life cycles over which to recognize license revenues  we consider the remaining life of proprietary protection and the economic lives of competing products in the specific or similar therapeutic categories 
we believe the estimated product life cycle the estimated economic life generally ends when prescription trends decline to less than of the product s peak prescriptions  which can be impacted by introductions of competing branded products  generic competition  and or changes improvements in forms of treatment therapy 
in the event that we receive a nonrefundable payment for a product that does not ultimately receive regulatory approval  the payment is recognized as revenue when all efforts cease  the project has been discontinued and we have no further obligation relating to the product 

table of contents in and  we entered into two sets of collaboration agreements with shire a agreement consisting primarily of the transfer to shire of a license to market and sell daytrana and a manufacturing and supply agreement under which we agreed to supply product to shire  and a agreement  as amended  to develop an amphetamine based transdermal patch to treat adhd and a related license agreement 
key elements of these agreements are described in note contract and license agreements to the consolidated financial statements 
our revenue recognition related to these agreements is described below 
shire collaboration daytrana under the shire daytrana collaboration arrangement  we determined that there were three deliverables a license  a research and development arrangement  and a manufacturing and supply agreement 
the license and research and development deliverables in this agreement did not meet the criteria for separation under eitf  therefore  they were combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we concluded that the manufacturing and supply agreement was at fair value based on our experience with similar arrangements  as a result  we accounted for it separately from the single unit of accounting license and research and development deliverable 
accordingly  all milestone payments including the up front payment  fda approval payment and subsequent sales milestones were allocated to the single unit of accounting 
in accordance with our policy  we began to recognize revenue for the single unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria related to all deliverables had been satisfied 
specifically  this occurred upon fda approval of daytrana in april  at which time all of our obligations were satisfied  shire had a commercially viable license and shire began realizing the value of the deliverable 
since this agreement provides for multiple payment streams  we recognize revenue as a single unit of accounting using a single attribution model for the license and research and development deliverables  whereby all milestone payments are recognized using the straight line method over the estimated life cycle of daytrana estimated to be seven years  as shire derives the value from the use of  or access to  the license 
shire collaboration amphetamine in connection with the amphetamine collaboration  shire paid us a nonrefundable payment of million in august  in exchange for the option to purchase  for an additional million  the exclusive developmental rights to the product 
the agreement  as amended  provided that we would perform certain early stage development activities 
we completed a phase clinical study for the product in march in june  shire exercised its option to acquire the exclusive development rights to the product and we received the million option payment 

table of contents simultaneous with the million payment  we agreed to modify the patch formulation in order to align the amphetamine patch with shire s future direction in the adhd market 
shire has agreed to pay us for our development efforts in this regard 
applying the guidance in eitf issue  the development agreement for the new formulation is  in essence  a modification and continuation of the original development agreement and  as a result  the total million arrangement consideration is considered a single unit of accounting 
this million arrangement consideration was included in deferred license and contract revenues on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have agreed to deliver a combination of development work and a license to market and sell this new product 
applying the guidance of eitf issue  we concluded that the license does not have standalone value to shire absent completion of our development efforts 
thus  the deliverables have been combined into a single unit of accounting 
revenue recognition will commence when the license has been delivered  we have fulfilled our obligations and shire begins realizing the value of the license deliverable related to this product 
the million and any additional consideration will be amortized on a systematic and rational straight line basis over the product s estimated life cycle  including shire s development period  as our performance and obligations will be complete once delivery of the license takes place 
contract revenues contract revenues consist of contract payments related to research and development projects performed for third parties where we have determined that such projects are separate units of accounting 
the work we perform may include feasibility studies to determine if a specific drug can be delivered transdermally  the actual formulation of a specific drug into a transdermal drug delivery system  studies to address the ongoing stability of the drug in a transdermal drug delivery system  and manufacturing of batches of product that can be used in human clinical trials 
we receive contract payments for the work we perform in the following forms nonrefundable up front payments prior to commencing the work or certain phases of the work  additional payments upon completion of additional phases  and in some cases  success milestone payments based on achievement of specified performance criteria 
we recognize revenue from nonrefundable up front payments based on the proportional performance method as we perform research and development work 
we recognize additional payments received upon completion of additional phases and milestone payments when the specified performance criteria are achieved under the milestone method as long as such milestones are substantive 
we record any difference between the amount of the payments received and the amount recognized as deferred license and contract revenues on our consolidated balance sheet until such amount is earned 
revenue recognition novogyne revenues at novogyne are recognized when all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which occurs at the time of shipment of products 
revenues are reduced at the time of sale to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience 
additionally  provisions are made at the time of sale for all discounts  rebates and estimated sales 
table of contents allowances based on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
the following table describes the activity for the revenue deduction accruals by major category for novogyne in which we hold a investment and account for using the equity method for the year ended december  amounts in thousands income statement charge reversal january  adjustments of december  payments prior years current year medicaid  medicare and state program rebates credits including prescription drug savings cards managed health care rebates chargebacks  including hospital chargebacks cash discounts  direct customer discounts other discounts sales returns allowances total these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations  requiring the use of judgment when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period 
these estimates for revenue deductions are derived utilizing a combination of information received from third parties  including market data  inventory reports from its major wholesale customers  historical information and other analysis 
the following briefly describes the nature of each revenue deduction and how the related accruals are estimated by novogyne the united states medicaid program is a state government administered program that uses state and federal funds to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and needy individuals and families 
in  the medicaid drug rebate program was established to reduce state and federal expenditures for prescription drugs 
under the rebate program  rebates are paid to states based on drugs paid for by those states 
provisions for estimating medicaid rebates are calculated using a combination of historical experience  product and population growth  price increases  the impact of contracting strategies and specific terms in the individual state agreements 
these provisions are then adjusted based upon the established re filing process with individual states 
for medicaid  the calculation of rebates involves interpretation of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities 
since medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 
table of contents six months after the product is dispensed  any rebate adjustments may involve revisions of accruals for several quarters 
prior to  the products also participated in prescription drug savings programs that offer savings to patients that are eligible participants under united states medicare programs 
these savings vary based on a patient s current drug coverage and personal income levels 
provisions for the obligations under these programs are based on historical experience  trend analysis and current program terms 
on january   an additional prescription drug benefit was added to the united states medicare program which funds healthcare benefits to individuals over the age of individuals that previously had dual medicaid medicare drug benefit eligibility had their medicaid prescription drug coverage replaced on january   by the new medicare part d coverage provided through private prescription drug plans 
the change led to a significant shift of plan participants between programs in which products participate 
provisions for medicare part d rebates are estimated using a combination of specific terms of individual plan agreements  product and population growth  price increases and the impact of contracting strategies 
wholesaler chargebacks relate to contractual arrangements with certain indirect customers to sell products at prices that are lower than the list price charged to wholesalers 
a wholesaler chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price charged to the wholesaler and the indirect customer s contract discount price 
provisions for estimating chargebacks are calculated using a combination of historical experience  product growth rates and the specific terms in each agreement 
wholesaler chargebacks are generally settled within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
managed health care rebates are offered to key managed health care  group purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase product market share 
these rebate programs provide that the customer receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to product purchases  formulary status and or pre established market share milestones relative to competitors 
since rebates are contractually agreed upon  rebates are estimated based on the specific terms in each agreement  historical experience and product growth rates 
the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel are tracked  and adjustments to the accrual are made periodically to reflect actual experience 
in order to evaluate adequacy of ending accrual balances  novogyne uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources include periodic reports of wholesalers and purchased third party market data 
management internally estimates the inventory level in the retail channel and in transit 
novogyne s policy is that no product will be shipped to customers with less than nine months of remaining shelf life and novogyne generally will accept returns due to expiration within twelve months after the product has expired 
an allowance for estimated sales returns is recorded based on i the historical experience of actual product returns  and ii the estimated lag time between when an actual sale takes place in relation to when the products are physically returned by a customer 
the historical actual returns rate is then applied to product sales during the estimated lag period to develop the returns estimate 
novogyne also considers trends and expectations for future demand and trade inventory levels 
these policies cause a significant lag time between when a product is 
table of contents sold and the latest date on which a return could occur 
novogyne believes this is a reasonable basis on which to estimate returns exposure and incorporates the key factors that contribute to returns 
in addition  novogyne establishes sales returns allowances for product that has been recalled or that it believes is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used to estimate product returns associated with recalls is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
novogyne s product supply policy is to maintain inventories on a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption 
wholesaler inventory levels are monitored monthly based on gross sales volume  prescription volumes based on third party data and information received from the key wholesalers 
based on this information  the inventories on hand at wholesalers and other distribution channels were estimated to be approximately one month at december  and novogyne believes the third party data sources of information are sufficiently reliable  however its accuracy cannot be independently verified 
cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment 
cash discounts  which are typically of gross sales  are accrued at the time of sale 
other sales discounts  such as consumer coupons and discount cards  are also offered 
these discounts are recorded at the time of sale and estimated utilizing historical experience and the specific terms for each program 
novartis controls and maintains the reserves associated with such sales allowances and returns on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed and issues credits to individual customers as deemed necessary 
the contracts that underlie these transactions are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those transactions relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying activity  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of charges that apply to sales by novogyne 
however  we can not control novartis analysis of the underlying activity or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in determining the reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would consequently also reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
revenue recognition noven therapeutics revenues at noven therapeutics are recognized when all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which occurs at the time of delivery 
revenues are reduced at the time of sale to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience 
additionally  provisions are made at the time of sale for all discounts  rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue 

table of contents the following table describes the activity for the revenue deduction accruals by major category for the period commencing with the acquisition of jds august  and ending december  amounts in thousands income august  statement december  payments charge medicaid  medicare and state program rebates credits including prescription drug savings cards chargebacks  including hospital chargebacks cash discounts other discounts sales returns allowances total these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations  requiring the use of judgment when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period 
these estimates for revenue deductions are derived utilizing a combination of information received from third parties  including market data  inventory reports from major wholesale customers  historical information and other analysis 
our management believes that it is able to reasonably estimate these sales deductions 
the revenue deductions for noven therapeutics and how we estimate the related accruals  are substantially similar to the revenue deductions at novogyne  with the following exceptions noven therapeutics policy is that generally no product will be shipped to customers with less than twelve months of remaining shelf life and generally returns due to expiration will be accepted within twelve months after the product has expired 
noven therapeutics supply policy is to maintain inventories on a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption 
wholesaler inventory levels are monitored monthly based on gross sales volume  prescription volumes based on third party data and information received from key wholesalers 
based on this information  the inventories on hand at wholesalers and other distribution channels are estimated to be approximately one month at december  for pexeva and lithobid products 
we believe the third party data sources are sufficiently reliable  however  its accuracy cannot be independently verified 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price allocation for our noven therapeutics acquisition was substantially complete as of december  we are in the process of finalizing the determination of certain amounts that were subject to post closing true ups and adjustments 
however  adjustments to the purchase price resulting from such items are not expected to be material 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives and methods used for amortization  can materially impact our results of operations 
fair values and useful lives are determined based on  among other factors  the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the various characteristics of the asset and projected cash flows 
this process requires us to make estimates with respect to future sales volumes  pricing  new product launches  anticipated product costs and overall market conditions 
because these estimates influence the values assigned the various assets acquired  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
in connection with our acquisition of jds  in addition to the value of acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities  we recorded on our balance sheet million of identifiable intangible assets  million of goodwill  and million of liabilities for contingent payments we expect to make related to the achievement of sales milestones for acquired products 
additionally  our cash flow estimates resulted in allocating million of the purchase price to ipr d  which was immediately charged to operations 
our forecast of future cash flows associated with ipr d required various assumptions to be made including revenues that are likely to result from the approved products or ipr d projects  including estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share  year over year growth rates over the product life cycles and estimated sales allowances  contract and license revenues generated by approved products or ipr d projects  cost of sales for the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expenses using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  and future equity in earnings of novogyne 
additional information about assumptions and other considerations related to the valuation of ipr d can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
our goodwill is assigned to our noven therapeutics reporting segment 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or more frequently  when events or other 
table of contents changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
if we determine at the date of the evaluation that the fair value of the reporting segment is less than its carrying value  then we would allocate the fair value of the segment to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting segment in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
a goodwill impairment would be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the fair value not allocated to identifiable assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our finite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment to the extent that the carrying value of a finite lived intangible exceeds its fair value 
as of december   we determined that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed 
we will continue to assess the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
income taxes our future effective tax rate is based on estimates of expected income and enacted statutory tax rates  as applied to our operations 
significant judgment is required in making these determinations and the ultimate resolution of our tax return positions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct  our policy is to establish accruals for tax contingencies that may result from examinations by tax authorities 
our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably possible that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
if we are assessed interest and or penalties by governing jurisdictions  we include those amounts in our tax provision 
our effective tax rate for was  while our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
if our effective tax rate differed from our estimate our results would vary 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we not record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax asset  which due to the jds acquisition increased to million as of december  primarily due to the immediate charge to operations of ipr d totaling million which is deductible for tax purposes over years 
estimates of future taxable income require us to make significant estimates that involve subjective and often complex judgments  the most significant of which relate to future cash flows of approved products and products in ipr d 
realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
noven therapeutics files separate state income tax returns in states where noven therapeutics has determined that it is required to file state income taxes 
as a result  state deferred tax assets relating to noven therapeutics are evaluated separately in determining whether the state deferred tax assets are realizable 
we expect that noven therapeutics will incur taxable state losses in the next few years due to future expected clinical trial expenditures related to product development 
these expected taxable losses create negative evidence indicating the need for a valuation allowance at december  we recorded a valuation allowance of million during the quarter ended september   due to uncertainties in realizing these state deferred tax assets based on our projection of future state taxable income 
if we determine  based on future noven therapeutics profitability that these state deferred tax assets are more likely 
table of contents than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate income tax benefit in the period the valuation allowance is released 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january   we adopted the provisions of and began accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with fin this interpretation requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin an enterprise cannot recognize a tax benefit for a tax position that is not likely to be sustained 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a result  changes in our subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes for additional information on our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
pre tax stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r was million and million in and  respectively 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and ssars 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee equity award exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected forfeiture rates and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options and ssars granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option or ssar  as described in sab we estimate the volatility of common stock by using a combination of both historical and implied volatility based on an equal weighting of each as management believes that marketplace participants would likely use the expected volatility in determining an exchange price for an option or ssar 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense accordingly 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our stock option and ssar grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments 
table of contents in the future 
stock options or ssars may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant dates  and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for our commercial branded products and under certain circumstances may include pre launch branded and generic products 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method  or fifo or market and as appropriate  we reflect provisions necessary to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our actual fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been substantially consistent with actual costs 
in addition  the allocation of overhead costs impacts our estimate of the cost of inventory 
total overhead costs  which were in excess of million in  include salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs  depreciation and insurance costs and represent a substantial portion of our inventory production costs 
the allocation of overhead to inventory production costs and between and among our various products requires us to make significant estimates that involve subjective and often complex judgments  including  among other things  normal production capacity  the relationship between labor costs and overhead costs  the extent of labor that goes into producing products and the amount of overhead costs absorbed in manufacturing inventory 
any change in these assumptions could materially impact our recorded cost of products sold and stated inventory balances 
our net inventory balances were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we determine the market value of our raw materials  finished product and packaging inventories based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation write down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a provision is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the provision is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for provisions we establish 
if our provisions prove to be inadequate  our inventories could be overstated or understated in any given period 
novogyne intangible asset as of december   novogyne had a long term intangible asset of million related to the acquisition of the marketing rights to combipatch 
the amortization of this asset is included in cost of sales in novogyne s financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 the combipatch marketing rights are assessed for impairments whenever events or changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows of the product 
this analysis requires novogyne to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments involving prescription trends  sales price  unit cost and product life cycle among many other factors 
in the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the product and the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment exists 
an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  calculated using a discounted future cash flow method 
an impairment loss would reduce net income in the period that the impairment occurs 
events giving rise to impairments are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted 
further declines in combipatch sales whether as a result of the ht studies  competition in the category or otherwise could require novogyne to record an impairment loss related to these marketing rights 
as a result of the significance of the combipatch marketing rights  any such impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on novogyne s and noven s financial condition and or results of operations 
novogyne loss contingencies novogyne is required to establish accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation  including product liability claims 
novogyne accrues estimated legal fees and settlement costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accruals for product liability claims are recorded by novogyne  on an undiscounted basis  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information 
novogyne includes estimated legal fees in accruals for product liability claims and makes adjustments as new information becomes available 
receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims under novogyne s third party insurance policy are recorded  on an undiscounted basis  when it is probable that a recovery will be realized 
novogyne s accruals and related receivables for product liability claims and other litigation accruals involve significant estimates  including estimates of incurred but not reported claims  estimates of cost per claim for both reported and unreported claims  allocation of cost between noven  novartis and novogyne based on ownership dates and applicable indemnification and other agreements between them  estimates of insurance recoveries and judgments as to the recoverability of insurance receivables recorded 
since july  novartis  along with various other pharmaceutical companies  has been named in a number of lawsuits involving novogyne s hormone replacement therapy products 
novogyne has established reserves in the amount of million as of december  for expected defense and settlement expenses related to pending lawsuits as well as for estimated future cases alleging use of novogyne s products 
in addition  novogyne has recorded an insurance receivable of million  which is novogyne s best estimate of the insurance coverage for recovery of claims 
novartis controls and maintains the accruals associated with such litigation on behalf of novogyne 
the litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those accruals and recoveries relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis based on claims specifically attributable to novogyne s products and novogyne s insurance policies 
based on an analysis of the underlying data  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries relating to novogyne 
however  we cannot control novartis analysis of the underlying data or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
litigation and its outcome are inherently difficult to predict 
any change in the estimates of number of cases  cost per case  allocation of cost between noven  novartis and novogyne  insurance recoveries and other assumptions could cause novogyne s and noven s financial results to significantly vary 
furthermore  if actual liability and insurance recoveries 
table of contents ultimately differ from that which has been recorded  novogyne s and noven s financial results in the period where the liability becomes payable and the insurance is recoverable could be materially affected by the adjustment of the liability and insurance recoveries 
no insurance proceeds have been recovered by novartis on behalf of novogyne as of december  new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at march   we held approximately million in auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are floating rate debt securities with long term nominal maturities  the interest rates of which are reset periodically typically every to days through a dutch auction process 
these periodic auctions have historically provided a liquid market for auction rate securities  as this mechanism generally allows existing investors to rollover their holdings and continue to own their respective securities at then existing market rates or to liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
in recent weeks as part of the ongoing credit market crisis  several auction 
table of contents rate securities from various issuers have failed to receive sufficient order interest from potential investors to clear successfully  resulting in an auction failure 
historically  when investor demand was insufficient  the banks running the auctions would step in and purchase the remaining securities to prevent an auction failure 
recently  however  the banks have been allowing these auctions to fail 
during the period from february  to march   auctions failed for approximately million of auction rate securities still owned by us at march  as a result  the securities related to the failed auctions could not be liquidated and pay interest at a maximum rate allowed in the governing documents or indenture 
we cannot predict when the liquidity of these securities will improve 
accordingly  as of december   we classified all of our auction rate securities as non current million  with the exception of million of securities that we liquidated subsequent to december  and a million variable rate demand note supported by an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by a bank 
our liquidity will be adversely affected to the extent that auctions for our auction rate securities experience further failures 
to enhance our liquidity position  we are currently seeking a credit facility  although we cannot assure that we will successfully obtain a credit facility on favorable terms or at all 
as of march   the auction rate securities that we hold are collateralized primarily by tax exempt municipal bonds  and to a lesser extent  guaranteed student loans 
we do not hold any auction rate securities collateralized by mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
we believe our auction rate securities are of high credit quality  as approximately of the investments carry an aa or aaa credit rating  and all are investment grade 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact on the fair market value of our investments 
if the fair value of the investments were to decline  management would be required to evaluate whether such decline is other than temporary in accordance with sfas no 
the amount of impairment which is determined to be temporary would be included in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
the amount of any such impairment loss which is determined to be other than temporary would be immediately recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
such a non cash impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations
