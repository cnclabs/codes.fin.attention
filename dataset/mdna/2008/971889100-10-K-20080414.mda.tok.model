item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in  wilshire primarily engaged in the real estate business 
during  and  the company also conducted activities related to winding up its oil and gas business which was sold in april the real estate business consists of residential and commercial properties in arizona  florida  new jersey and texas 
within this portfolio of properties  certain properties have been designated as being held for sale and have been classified as discontinued operations 
discontinued operations contain properties that may have excellent cash flow or valuation characteristics but that may be positioned for sale at an optimal valuation or may not be in a geographic region that is currently being targeted by the company 
the following discussion takes an income statement approach and discusses the results of operations first for the properties comprising continuing operations and then discusses the discontinued operations 
the assets comprising wilshire s oil and gas business were sold in april  effective march  oil and gas operations for all periods presented in this report have been classified as discontinued operations 
the company s activities are reviewed and analyzed in the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
certain statements in this discussion may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements reflect wilshire s current expectations regarding future results of operations  economic performance  financial condition and achievements of wilshire  and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
wilshire has tried  wherever possible  to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  or words of similar meaning 
although wilshire believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such factors include  but are not limited to the risks described in item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies pursuant to the securities and exchange commission sec disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies  the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
wilshire s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon wilshire s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires wilshire to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
wilshire bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of property and equipment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of its real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
management does not believe at december  or that the value of any of its properties was impaired 
revenue recognition revenue from real estate properties is recognized during the period in which the premises are occupied and rent is due from tenants 
for commercial properties  rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in accounts receivable 
for residential properties where lease agreements are almost exclusively for one year terms  rental revenue is recognized in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying leases 
the company follows a policy of aggressively pursuing its rental tenants to ensure timely payment of amounts due 
when a tenant becomes days in arrears on paying rent  the amount is written off and turned over to a collection agency for action 
accordingly  no allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained for the company s real estate tenants 
foreign operations the assets and liabilities of wilshire s substantially liquidated canadian subsidiary have been translated at year end exchange rates 
the related revenues and expenses have been translated at average annual exchange rates 
translation gains or losses are included in the company s results of operations 
as a result of the sale of the canadian oil and gas assets in  wilshire provided for at december  and paid during  million of united states taxes 
during  the company s canadian affiliate declared and paid to wilshire dividends amounting to million  resulting in the payment of  of canadian taxes

stock based compensation wilshire followed the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas and sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
the provisions of sfas r were adopted commencing january  sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on wilshire s consolidated financial statements with respect to previously granted equity compensation 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company s adoption of sfas in is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas permits entities to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
the company s adoption of sfas in is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
the standards are intended to improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas is designed to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  sfas eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
in addition  sfas shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the company does not have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries and therefore  sfas is not applicable to the company at this time

in january  the company closed on the sale of a bedroom condominium at jefferson gardens  new jersey for gross proceeds of approximately  after payments of closing costs and providing for taxes  the company expects to realize a gain during the first quarter of approximately  from this sale 
see item a of this annual report for information regarding certain long term commitments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has an investment in the common stock of one publicly traded real estate company in the united states in which the company has exposure to the risk of market value fluctuation 
the company accounts for this investment as securities that are available for sale and marks them to market at each period end 
the change in value in the investment  net of tax impact  is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity 
the company also evaluates its investment to determine if it has suffered a decline in market value that is permanent  which would require a charge to the statement of operations 
at december   in the opinion of management  there has been no permanent decline in value in the company s holdings of equity securities 
after the sale of its canadian oil and gas assets  the company has cash and cash equivalents at its canadian subsidiary whose value is exposed to fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate 
the change in value in the canadian dollar denominated accounts is reported in the statement of operations 
the company anticipates that it will repatriate all assets  net of liabilities  of its canadian subsidiary during long term debt  consisting solely of mortgage notes payable  totaled the following as of december  and december  total debt less current portion long term portion includes debt associated with discontinued operations of  in and  in includes debt associated with discontinued operations of  in and  in the aggregate maturities of the long term debt in each of the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter are year amount thereafter at december   the company had  of mortgage debt and notes outstanding which all bear interest at an average fixed rate of and an average remaining life of approximately years 
the fixed rate mortgages and notes are subject to repayment amortization schedules that are longer than the term of the mortgages 
as such  the approximate amount of balloon payments for all mortgage debt and notes that will be required is as follows year amount wilshire expects to re finance the individual mortgages and notes with new mortgages and notes when their terms expire 
to this extent  we have exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed rate mortgage debt and note obligations 
if interest rates  at the time any individual debt instrument is due  are higher than the current fixed interest rate  higher debt service may be required  and or re financing proceeds may be less than the amount of mortgage debt or notes being retired 
we believe that the values of our properties will be adequate to command re financing proceeds equal to  or higher than  the mortgage debt to be re financed 
this expectation represents a forward looking statement 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s forward looking statement include economic conditions in the markets where such properties are located and the level of market interest rates at the time the company is seeking to re finance the properties 
at december   we had million of principal invested in auction rate securities ars 
as of march   we had reduced our holdings in ars investments to approximately million 
the monthly auctions for these ars investments have historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
our investments in ars represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of loans with long term nominal maturities but for which interest rates are normally reset every seven days to every days through a dutch auction process 
consistent with our policy  all ars investments were rated at the time of purchase and are still currently rated aaa or the equivalent thereto 
none of the ars investments in our portfolio were backed by sub prime mortgage loans or other collateral with exposure to certain current market conditions 
additionally  all ars holdings at december  have subsequently been successfully settled through the dutch auction process by either being liquidated into cash or experiencing an interest rate reset 
however  liquidity issues experienced recently in global credit and capital markets have prevented us from liquidating certain ars investments that reset subsequent to december  as the amount of securities submitted for sale at recent ars auctions has exceeded the market demand  though they continue to pay interest according to their stated terms 
although insufficient demand for certain ars may continue  we anticipate  based on discussions with our investment advisors  that liquidity for our securities may possibly be realized through the emergence of secondary markets in the near term  particularly considering the high default interest rates  high credit ratings  the backing of the federal family education loan program ffelp and or the underlying assets collateralizing these investments 
as such  we believe that the primary impact of the failed auctions is reduced liquidity rather than impairment of principal 
in the event that we are unable to sell the investments at or above our carrying value  these securities may not provide us with a liquid source of cash 
notwithstanding the above  if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue and secondary markets for ars do not emerge  we may not be able to convert these investments into cash during our required timeframe 
even if secondary markets do emerge  we may experience a temporary loss of principal if such securities are initially marketed at a discount or a sustained loss if it becomes necessary to sell these investments at such a discount 
in addition  should the credit ratings of our ars be downgraded  we might incur further problems in liquidating our investments
