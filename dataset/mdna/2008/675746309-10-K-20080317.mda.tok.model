item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except share data the following discussion of our results of operations  consolidated financial condition and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
executive summary strategic goals ocwen financial corporation is a business process outsourcing provider to the financial services industry  specializing in loan servicing  mortgage fulfillment and receivables management services 
our primary goal is to make our client s loans worth more by leveraging our superior processes  innovative technology and high quality  cost effective global human resources 
our business is comprised of three segments residential servicing  ocwen recovery group and residential origination services 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results for the periods indicated 
refer to the segments section for a more complete discussion of operating results by line of business 
for the years ended december  change change consolidated revenue operating expenses income from operations other expense  net income from continuing operations before taxes income tax expense benefit income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income segment income loss from continuing operations before taxes residential servicing ocwen recovery group residential origination services corporate items and other compared to our results for were characterized by higher income from operations  increased interest expense related to funding requirements for servicing advances and losses on residual securities and loans held for resale 
unrealized losses on residual securities were significantly offset by the gain we realized from our sale of the uk residuals 
interest income decreased due to reduced investments in loans held for resale  and we recognized a loss on our early redemption of cds 
although residential servicing continues to be our most profitable segment  rising delinquencies and declining prepayments on residential mortgages have had a negative impact on results 
the significant rise in delinquencies and decline in prepayment speeds have resulted in revenue growth that has lagged portfolio growth and increased interest expense related to the financing of higher servicing advance balances 
this was offset somewhat by lower amortization of msrs due to the decline in prepayment speeds 
the results for ocwen recovery group in reflect the june  acquisition of nci  which incurred a loss for the period 
the results for residential origination services are characterized by lower interest income attributed to reduced balances of loans held for resale and our sale of the uk residuals and higher charges to reduce loans and residual securities to estimated market values  largely offset by improved earnings from fee based businesses  a realized gain from the sale of the uk residuals and the closing of our subprime loan origination operation  which generated a loss in total revenues increased by  or in principally because of the acquisition of nci  which added  of revenues to the ocwen recovery group segment 
residential servicing revenue increased by in rising delinquencies constrained revenue growth because we do not recognize servicing fees until payments are collected 
we estimate that we had  of uncollected delinquent servicing fees at december  that we had not recognized as revenue  an increase of  as compared to december  declining prepayment speeds resulted in lower custodial account balances and related float income 
revenues of the residential origination services segment were greater than as increases in fees from residential property valuations and title services offset declines in mortgage due diligence and loan refinancing fees 
total operating expenses were  or  higher in ocwen recovery group operating expenses increased by  largely because of the acquisition of nci  which added  of operating expenses in residential servicing operating expenses declined by  or  as an  decline in the amortization of msrs and a  decline in professional services  primarily legal fees  offset a  increase in compensation and benefits due to increased staffing levels in india as a result of portfolio growth and an increase in non performing loans 
slower prepayment speeds have reduced the rate of msr amortization as we expect to earn the servicing income over a longer period of time 
residential origination services operating expenses were  or less in as compensation and benefits declined by  largely due to our closing of the subprime loan origination operation  and professional services declined by  because of lower fees paid in connection with securitizations of loans held for resale 
as a result  income from operations for residential servicing and residential origination services improved by  and   respectively 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease of  in the income from operations of ocwen recovery group that resulted from the acquisition of nci 
other expense  net increased in as a result of several significant factors 
the costs of financing servicing advances and servicing rights increased in because of the growth in these assets and higher interest rates on average  resulting in a  or  increase in interest expense for the residential servicing segment 
our residential origination services segment suffered a decline in interest income in due to a lower investment in loans held for resale and our sale of the uk residuals 
in addition  residential origination services incurred unrealized losses of  in due principally to the write down during the fourth quarter of subprime subordinate and residual securities to their estimated market values reflecting significantly higher projected loss assumptions  largely offset by a gain of  realized from our sale of the uk residuals in the second quarter 
these changes resulted in a  decrease in other income expense  net for residential origination services 
in corporate items and other  other income expense  net decreased by  largely because of a loss of  realized when an unanticipated liquidity need that arose in the third quarter caused us to redeem our zero coupon certificates of deposit prior to their maturity 
compared to our results reflect a strong performance in our residential servicing segment  which is our most profitable segment 
the significant improvement over was primarily due to higher servicing fees because of growth in the portfolio and slower run off of the existing portfolio due to a reduction in mortgage prepayments 
in addition  rising short term interest rates increased revenue from float earnings 
in spite of the revenue growth  operating expenses declined slightly in because of cost containment measures and the positive impact of slower prepayment speeds on amortization and compensating interest expense 
the costs of financing servicing advances and servicing rights increased in because of the growth in these assets and rising interest rates 
results of our residential origination services segment improved in because of higher earnings from our fee based loan processing activities partially offset by higher losses in our subprime origination activities  which we discontinued in in  revenues of the residential servicing segment grew by  or principally because of the growth in servicing fees generated by a increase in the average balance of loans serviced 
float earnings also increased by  or because of higher yields on the investment of custodial balances 
residential origination services revenues increased by  or as higher fees generated by title services were partially offset by declines in fees from property valuation services 
finally  the revenues of the ocwen recovery group segment declined by  or on a decline in volume as management focused on cost reduction and enhancing staff effectiveness rather than on revenue growth 
operating expenses for were relatively unchanged from as increases in expenses of the residential origination services segment were largely offset by declines in the residential servicing and ocwen recovery group segments 
residential origination services operating expenses rose by  or principally because of the  of compensation and benefits added by the operation of our subprime loan origination operation and an increase in fees paid in connection with the securitization of loans held for resale 
as a result  income from operations increased by  or other income expense  net was also relatively unchanged in higher interest expense in the residential servicing segment driven by the need to finance our growing investment in advances and msrs was largely offset by an increase in interest income on loans held for resale in the residential origination services segment that was greater than the increase in interest expense needed to fund our investment in these loans 
we acquired the loans in the latter part of and the first half of  and securitized them in the first  second and fourth quarters of the income tax benefit of  primarily reflects the reversal of  of deferred tax asset valuation allowances to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
changes in financial condition total assets grew by  or in this increase was primarily due to a  increase in total advances  a  increase in other assets and a  increase in goodwill and intangibles 
our advance requirements have increased in as a result of higher delinquencies  slower prepayments and growth in the residential servicing portfolio 
the increase in other assets was primarily due to an increase in the balance of debt service accounts related to advance funding facilities 
the increase in goodwill and intangibles is primarily the result of our acquisition of nci 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in cash and investment grade securities  redemption of our cds  which had a carrying value of  at december   and a  decrease in subordinate and residual securities 
the decline in cash and investment grade securities reflects lower collections and increased advance funding requirements 
the decline in subordinates and residuals reflects our sale of the uk residuals and valuation declines reflecting conditions in the subprime market 
total liabilities increased by  or in this increase was largely the result of a  increase in amounts due under match funded liabilities primarily because of increased funding requirements on advances 
this increase was offset in part by a  decrease in servicer liabilities that was primarily due to lower collections caused by declining prepayment speeds and rising delinquencies 
at december   we had  of stockholders equity  a  increase over december  that was primarily due to net income of  for partially offset by our repurchase of one million shares of our common stock for  residential servicing the key business drivers in the residential servicing segment are prepayment speed  aggregate upb and delinquencies 
prepayment speed 
the most significant driver of our business is prepayment speed  which is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down their upb  including payments in full as a result of refinancings 
prepayment speed has a significant impact on servicing fees  amortization of servicing rights  float income  interest expense on advances and compensating interest expense 
if prepayment speed increases  our servicing fees will decrease because of the decline in the upb on which those fees are based 
additionally  since we amortize servicing rights in proportion to total expected income over the life of a portfolio  an increase in prepayment speed will lead to accelerated amortization expense as we revise downward the estimated lives of the pools of loans that we service 
conversely  decreases in prepayment speeds drive increased revenue and can extend the period over which we amortize msrs 
when interest rates rise  it is relatively less attractive for borrowers to refinance their loans  and as a result  prepayment speed tends to decrease 
when rates fall  prepayment speed tends to increase 
prepayment speed affects our float balances which in turn affects float income 
increased prepayment speed leads to higher float balances since we hold the entire loan pay off amount before we remit it to the investor as opposed to a single monthly payment 
these higher float balances lead to increased float income 
slower prepayment speed leads to lower float balances and income 
slower prepayment speeds result in lower collections which increases the average outstanding balance of servicing advances and the amount of interest expense we incur on the financing of those advances 
in addition  prepayment speed has a significant impact on compensating interest expense 
faster prepayment speeds mean that more loans pay off early which results in higher compensating interest expense 
compensating interest expense represents the difference between the full month of interest that we are required to remit to the remic trustee in the month that a loan pays off and the amount of interest that we actually collect from the borrower for that month 
slower prepayment speeds lead to lower compensating interest expense 
compensating interest expense is included in servicing and origination expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
aggregate unpaid principal balance 
aggregate upb is another key revenue driver 
as noted earlier  servicing fees are usually earned as a percentage of upb  and growth in the portfolio means growth in servicing fees 
additionally  a larger servicing portfolio generates increased ancillary fees and leads to larger custodial balances which generate greater float income 
larger upb also drives increases in expenses 
to the extent that we grow upb through the purchase of msrs  our amortization of msrs will generally increase with our servicing revenues 
we will also incur additional interest expense to finance the purchase of msrs and servicing advances  and our compensating interest expense will increase as the size of our portfolio increases 
delinquencies 
delinquencies also have a significant impact on our results of operations 
non performing loans are more expensive to service than performing loans because our cost of advance funding and our cost of servicing are higher 
performing loans include those loans that are current or have been delinquent for less than days in accordance with their original terms and those loans for which borrowers are making scheduled payments under forbearance or bankruptcy plans 
we consider all other loans to be non performing 
when borrowers are delinquent  the amount of funds that we are required to advance to the investors on behalf of the borrowers increases 
while the collectibility of advances generally is not an issue  we do incur significant costs to finance those advances 
we utilize both securitization  ie  match funded liabilities and revolving credit facilities to finance our advances 
as a result  increased delinquencies result in increased interest expense 
in addition  the cost of servicing non performing loans is higher than the cost of servicing performing loans primarily because the loss mitigation techniques that we employ to keep borrowers in their homes are more costly than the techniques used in handling a performing loan 
when loans are performing  we have limited interaction with the borrowers  and relatively low cost customer service personnel conduct most of that interaction 
once a loan becomes delinquent  however  we must employ our loss mitigation capabilities to work with the borrower to return the loan to performing status 
these procedures involve increased contact with the borrower and the development of forbearance plans or loan modifications by highly skilled consultants who command higher compensation 
on those occasions when loans go into foreclosure  we incur additional costs related to coordinating the work of local attorneys to represent us in the foreclosure process 
finally  when we foreclose on loans  we employ specialists to service the real estate and manage the sale of those properties on behalf of our investors 
a significant increase in delinquencies would cause us to increase our activities in these areas resulting in increased operating expenses 
this increase in operating expenses should be somewhat offset by increased late fees for loans that become delinquent but do not enter the foreclosure process 
in spite of a increase in the average number of loans we serviced in and a doubling of the percentage of such loans that were non performing at december   operating expenses excluding amortization of servicing rights increased by only in as compared to this reflects our continued progress in controlling costs which results in a lower cost per unit to service 
the following table provides key business drivers and other selected revenue and expense items of the residential servicing segment at or for the years ended december change change average upb of loans and real estate serviced prepayment speed average cpr upb of non performing loans and real estate serviced as a percentage of total at december average number of loans and real estate serviced number of non performing loans and real estate serviced as a percentage of total at december average float balances average balance of advances and match funded advances average balance of msrs collections on loans serviced for others servicing and subservicing fees excluding float and ancillary income float earnings amortization of servicing rights interest expense on match funded liabilities and lines of credit compensating interest expense operating expenses directly related to loss mitigation activities excluding real estate serviced pursuant to our contract with the va 
as of february   the upb of non performing loans was of the total 
the increase in non performing loans in is a result of an increase in the average age of our portfolio  the poor performance of originations  an increase in the number and level of adjustable rate mortgage arm resets and a slow down in home price appreciation amongst other factors 
in  we do not expect to make significant additions to our servicing portfolio and  therefore  expect revenues to decline as a result of the net runoff of the portfolio 
the rate of growth in our advances and delinquency rates has slowed through february  relative to the rate of growth experienced in the latter half of  and we expect this trend to continue in our outlook on prepayment speeds is that they will remain at or near current levels in residential origination services our residential origination services segment consists of three components fee based loan processing businesses 
these businesses provide various loan processing services to clients involved in the mortgage origination  servicing  loan acquisition and securitization processes 
the services that we provide to our clients include residential property valuation services  mortgage due diligence  title services  and outsourcing services  including mortgage underwriting  data entry  call center services and mortgage research 
these fee based businesses have limited capital requirements and represent a balance between resolution  servicing and origination of loans  thereby producing relatively stable earnings in spite of the decline in loan origination activity in we believe that our continued success in this area is dependent on our ability to efficiently manage our operating costs and continue to improve the quality and timeliness of service delivery so that we can provide high quality products at competitive prices 
trading and investing activities 
this business includes our investments in subprime residual mortgage backed securities as well the results of our whole loan purchase and securitization activities and the loans remaining from our subprime origination business 
during  we deemphasized our whole loan purchase and securitization activities 
the key to our results in this area is the performance of our assets  particularly with respect to default risk associated with our loans held for resale and with the loans underlying our mortgage backed securities 
the current liquidity environment has had a negative impact on asset valuations  resulting in significantly higher charges in to reduce subprime residual securities and loans to their estimated market values 
subprime originations 
in january  we decided to close our subprime loan origination operation and no longer originate loans 
ocwen recovery group ocwen recovery group is our unsecured collections business 
effective june   this segment includes the results of nci  a receivables management company we acquired that specializes in contingency collections for credit card issuers and other consumer credit providers 
our current focus is on the improvement of nci s financial performance 
in that regard  we have developed an action plan that includes appropriate staffing of collectors to address the current shortage and the expected increase in volume reflective of rising delinquencies and charge offs in the current credit environment  improved financial performance on nci s largest first party outsourcing client through a fee increase and revised pricing methodology  and the ramp up of collection operations at our new facility in india 
we also continue to focus on the integration of nci and ocwen recovery group operations to take advantage of nci s strong customer relationships and ocn s global infrastructure 
we have implemented an integration plan to generate cost savings from the combined operations through the elimination of redundant expenses and migration of us based collector and administrative jobs  primarily through attrition  to india 
we believe the key to our success in this segment is our ability to perform well for our customers  which in turn  will lead to more account placements and continued growth of top line revenue 
our ability to perform well for our customers is largely dependent on our success in the training and retention of collection staff 
strategic initiatives investments in asset management vehicles 
in  we began developing asset management vehicles that benefit from our servicing and loss mitigation capabilities 
these entities provide us with a controlled source of servicing 
ocwen structured investments  llc osi 
to date we have invested  in osi and have committed to invest up to an additional  under our agreement with the other investors 
osi began operations during the second quarter of our ownership interest in osi is 
osi invests primarily in msrs and the related lower tranches and residuals of residential mortgage backed securities  the credit risk of which is hedged with single name credit default swaps and the abx index 
we are responsible for managing osi s portfolio under a management agreement and for subservicing its msrs 
we  along with the other principal investors  receive a preferential return in excess of our ownership interest in the event that osi achieves certain performance objectives 
these preferential distributions are  however  subject to a repayment provision should the future performance of osi not support the preference payments made to the principal investors 
ocwen nonperforming loans  llc onl 
our investments in onl and related entities represent equity interests 
these entities invest in non performing loans purchased at a discount and foreclosed real estate 
we act as the servicer of the loans 
to date we have invested a combined  in onl and related entities and have committed to invest up to an additional  segment realignment 
we are realigning our business segments in in conjunction with implementing our revised business strategy 
in addition to our core residential servicing business  ocwen asset management or oam will include our existing asset management vehicles and planned future investments 
we expect to grow our existing asset management vehicles and develop other vehicles that leverage our asset management capabilities 
in addition to our unsecured collections business  ocwen solutions or os will include the fee based businesses that currently are part of our residential origination services segment  all of our technology platforms and our interest in bms 
os is a knowledge process outsourcer 
our competitive advantage  which is similar to the residential servicing business  is our ability to migrate high value  knowledge based job functions to low cost global platforms utilizing artificial intelligence  scripting engines  decisioning models and workflow management to improve quality through the elimination of variability 
liquidity our balance sheet reflects the impact of rising mortgage delinquencies and declining prepayment speeds 
cash and investment grade securities totaled  at december   a  decline as compared to december  due to lower collections and increased advance funding requirements 
collections on residential loans serviced for others were  in  down from the  we collected in servicer liabilities  which represent cash collected from borrowers but not yet remitted to securitization trusts  have declined by  from december  to december  while total advances have increased by  during the same period  principally in our residential servicing segment 
our borrowings have increased by  since december   including  related to our residential servicing segment 
our increased advance funding requirements have caused us to increase our borrowing capacity through the renewal and expansion of existing credit facilities and the establishment of new facilities 
we have also taken actions toward obtaining additional increases in the future 
our total maximum borrowing capacity was  as of december   an increase of  as compared to december  this increase is primarily due to a  increase in borrowing capacity of the residential servicing segment offset by a  decline in borrowing capacity of the residential origination services segment 
the increase in residential servicing borrowing capacity represents a  increase under new and existing match funded advance agreements and a  increase under the existing secured line of credit 
the decline in residential origination services borrowing capacity is primarily the result of our closing of the subprime loan origination operation and our de emphasis on loan trading activities 
at december    of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused  including  attributed to the residential servicing business 
of the unused borrowing capacity  approximately  was collateralized and readily available 
on february   we negotiated a renewal of one of our match funded facilities under which we increased our maximum borrowing capacity from  to  and extended the stated maturity of the facility to february during the first quarter of  a match funded term note in the amount of  that was issued under our largest facility entered its amortization period 
when the amortization period begins  all collections representing the repayment of advances that have been financed through this note must be applied to reduce the balance of the note  and any new advances under the securitizations pledged to the note are not eligible to be financed 
as of february   the total maximum borrowing capacity of our residential servicing business through match funded facilities and lines of credit was  of which approximately  was unused and approximately  was collateralized and readily available 
borrowing capacity under a secured advance facility may only be utilized to the extent that underlying collateral is pledged to that financing facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities 
for more information about our credit facilities  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
despite our success in renewing and expanding our credit facilities  the liquidity crisis that occurred in the global capital markets beginning in the third quarter of affected us in several ways 
it caused lenders to tighten their lending standards which made financing for advances more difficult to obtain 
it slowed the lending process by causing the major rating agencies to work more slowly on rating new financing because of the reevaluations of and other ratings that they were required to perform 
it caused the cost of funding to increase because of both larger interest rate spreads over libor and commercial paper rates and increased up front fees that were demanded by lenders 
our msrs continue to be financed under our senior secured credit agreement based on fair value less a financing discount  which is the difference between the fair value of the assets pledged as collateral to secure our financings and the amount that the lenders will advance to us 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of risks in the marketplace or other future events 
our critical accounting policies are those that relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation and amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our residential servicing business 
inherent in this business is the acquisition of msrs  an intangible asset representing the value of the right to service the loans in a portfolio 
as of december   we held residential msrs with a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  the most critical accounting policy for this business is the methodology we use to value and amortize msrs 
application of this methodology requires the development of a number of estimates  including anticipated amortization  and periodic re evaluation of these estimates 
we estimate the fair value of our msrs based on the results of our internal valuation 
our internal valuation calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows utilizing external assumptions that we believe are used by market participants 
in addition  we periodically review third party valuations of certain of our msrs to assess the reasonableness of our valuation assumptions and the resulting fair value estimates 
the most significant assumptions used in our internal valuation are the expected speed at which mortgages prepay and expected delinquencies  both of which we derive from our historical experience and available market data 
other assumptions used in our internal valuation include cost of servicing compensating interest expense discount rate interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances interest rate used for computing float earnings the significant cash inflows considered in estimating future cash flows include servicing fees  late fees  prepayment penalties  float earnings and other ancillary fees 
significant cash outflows include the cost of servicing  the cost of making servicing advances and compensating interest payments 
we base our strata on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
our strata include subprime alt a high loan to value re performing special servicing other at december   we had msrs relating to the subprime  alt a and high loan to value strata 
the following table provides the range of prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage by strata projected over the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value while we develop the discount rate internally in light of prevailing market conditions  we base the interest rate for the cost of financing advances  the interest rate for float earnings and the cost of servicing on external market based assumptions 
as of december   these assumptions were as follows discount rate of interest rate of one month libor plus basis points for the cost of financing advances interest rate equal to the federal funds rate for float earnings assumptions regarding the cost of servicing represent industry averages  vary by strata and range from a low of per year for a performing alt a loan to a high of per year for a loan in foreclosure 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as summarized below increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster which causes accelerated msr amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing  increased float balances on higher float earnings and lower interest expense on decreased servicing advance balances 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amount of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the combined cash flows 
increases in interest rate assumptions for the cost of servicing advances will increase interest expense although this effect is partially offset because rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize 
we periodically perform an impairment analysis based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value of msrs after grouping our loans into the applicable strata 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio and the default risk 
we amortize msrs over the period of estimated net servicing income based on our projections of the amount and timing of future cash flows 
we determine these projections using the same assumptions that we use in our internal valuation of msrs 
the amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is adjusted periodically based on actual results and updated projections 
during most of  mortgage prepayment speeds in our servicing portfolio remained high resulting in a historically high rate of amortization 
in and  which featured rising subprime mortgage interest rates and home prices that were declining or appreciating much more slowly  we experienced lower mortgage prepayment speeds which resulted in a slower rate of amortization 
valuation of trading securities and loans held for resale we currently account for our investment grade  residual and subordinate securities as trading securities at fair value 
we report changes in fair value in gain loss on trading securities in the period of change 
we adjust our investment grade securities for which external marks are available to fair value based on third party dealer quotations 
our subordinate and residual securities are not actively traded and  therefore  market quotations are not available 
we estimate fair value using an industry accepted discounted cash flow model which is calibrated for trading activity whenever possible 
expected future cash flows are estimated using our best estimate of key assumptions such as discount  delinquency and cumulative loss rates as well as prepayment speeds associated with the loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
discount rates for the subordinate and residual securities range from to and are determined based upon an assessment of prevailing market conditions and prices for similar assets 
we project the delinquency  loss and prepayment assumptions based on historical experience  adjusted for prevailing market conditions 
delinquency assumptions range from to  and loss assumptions range from to 
average prepayment assumptions range from to 
estimated fair value represents management s best estimate of an amount that could ultimately be realized in an actual sale transaction 
as of december   investment grade securities had a fair value of  net of unrealized losses of  residual and subordinate securities had a fair value of  at december   net of unrealized losses of  we classify loans that we do not intend to hold to maturity as loans held for resale and report them at the lower of cost or market value 
we account for the excess of cost over market value as a market valuation allowance with changes in the valuation allowance included in gain loss on loans held for resale  net  in the period in which the change occurs 
loans for which we have entered into an agreement to sell to an investor at a set price are valued at the commitment price 
for uncommitted performing loans  we estimate fair value based on quotes for similar loans 
we base the fair value of uncommitted non performing loans on estimates of expected future cash flows discounted using a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs until the loans are sold 
these fees and costs are considered in the carrying value of the loans when determining a market valuation allowance 
as of december   loans held for resale of  were net of market valuation allowances of  valuation of deferred tax assets the use of estimates and the application of judgment is involved in the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and a corresponding valuation allowance of resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  during  we reversed  of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  including  during the second quarter  in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
we established our valuational lowance during the period through our evaluation of the need to maintain a valuation allowance takes into consideration evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of future taxable income 
the tax character ordinary versus capital and the carry forward and carry back periods of certain tax attributes eg  capital losses and tax credits are also considered 
judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to realizability of the deferred tax assets 
we base the determination of the amount of the aggregate valuation allowance on scenario analyses of the projected results of operations by line of business resulting in a range of potential valuation allowances within which a final amount is determined 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
litigation we continuously monitor the status of our legal matters 
we obtain advice from external legal counsel in our periodic assessment of legal matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we make a determination of the amount of the reserves required in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

residential servicing the following table sets forth information regarding residential loans and real estate serviced for others loans real estate total amount count amount count amount count december  performing non performing december  performing non performing at december   we serviced  subprime loans with a upb of  as compared to  subprime loans with a upb of  at december  performing loans include those loans that are current or have been delinquent for less than days in accordance with their original terms and those loans for which borrowers are making scheduled payments under forbearance or bankruptcy plans 
we consider all other loans to be non performing 
the increase in non performing loans in is a result of an increase in the average age of our portfolio  the poor performance of originations  an increase in the number and level of adjustable rate mortgage arm resets and a slow down in home price appreciation amongst other factors 
we serviced under subservicing contracts  residential loans with a upb of  as of december  this compares to  residential loans with a upb of  at december  real estate includes  and  of foreclosed residential properties serviced for the va at december  and  respectively 
the average upb of assets serviced during  and was   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth information regarding the changes in our portfolio of residential assets serviced for others amount count servicing portfolio at beginning of year additions runoff servicing portfolio at end of year additions primarily represent servicing purchased from the owners of the mortgages and servicing obtained by entering into subservicing agreements with other entities that own the servicing rights 
additions were lower in largely as a result of the significant decline in subprime loan originations  particularly in the second half of the year 
runoff includes principal repayments on loans  servicing transfers and other asset resolutions 
the decline in runoff in primarily reflects lower collections due to falling prepayments and rising delinquencies 
in addition to acting as servicer and subservicer  we have entered into a backup servicing agreement with a large trust company that acts as trustee for securitizations encompassing more than  of mortgage loans 
as backup servicer  we have agreed to accept the servicing responsibilities on up to  of mortgage loans in the event that the trustee terminates the primary servicer 
the agreement requires that we complete within days the transfer of servicing from the terminated primary servicer

during any period in which the borrower is not making payments  we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors  pay property taxes and insurance premiums and process foreclosures 
we also advance funds to maintain  repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors 
we are entitled to recover advances from borrowers for reinstated and performing loans and from investors for foreclosed loans 
however  we are only obligated to advance funds to the extent that we believe the advances are recoverable 
furthermore  there is little risk of loss on advances because most of our advances have the highest standing for reimbursement from payments  repayments and liquidation proceeds at the loan level 
in addition  for any advances that are not covered by loan proceeds  most of our pooling and servicing agreements provide for reimbursement at the loan pool level  either by using collections on other loans or by requesting reimbursement from the securitization trust 
during  the combined balance of advances and match funded advances increased by  this reflects an increase in advance requirements as a result of higher delinquencies and slower prepayments 
match funded advances result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to special purpose entities spes in exchange for cash 
we made these transfers under the terms of four match funded advance financing agreements  as amended 
the match funded advances are owned by the spes and are not available to satisfy general claims of our creditors 
in response to the growth in advances  we increased the maximum borrowing capacity under our match funded liability agreements by  during see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the composition of advances and match funded advances

match funded liabilities 
match funded liabilities are obligations secured by the collateral underlying the related match funded assets and are repaid through the cash proceeds arising from those assets 
we account for and report match funded liabilities as secured borrowings with pledges of collateral 
as of december  and  all of our match funded liabilities were secured by advances on loans serviced for others 
the  increase in match funded liabilities during primarily reflects a net increase in borrowing capacity and an increase in advance funding requirements

servicer liabilities 
servicer liabilities represent amounts we have collected  primarily from residential servicing borrowers  which we will deposit in custodial accounts  pay directly to an investment trust or refunded to borrowers 
custodial accounts are excluded from our balance sheet 
the balance of servicer liabilities at both december  and consisted primarily of borrower payments due to custodial accounts 
servicer liabilities declined by  during largely due to a  decline in the amount of borrower payments due to custodial accounts

the principal components of servicing and subservicing fees are loan servicing and subservicing late charges custodial accounts float earnings loan collection fees other loan servicing and subservicing fees for are up over primarily due to a increase in the average balance of loans serviced 
loan servicing and subservicing fees for increased by as compared to primarily because of a increase in the average balance of loans serviced 
the growth in revenue attributed to the higher average balance of loans serviced was partially offset by the impact of rising delinquencies 
we collect servicing fees  generally expressed as a percent of the upb  from the borrowers payments 
we recognize servicing fees as revenue upon collection 
delinquencies affect the timing of servicing fee revenue recognition  but not the ultimate collection of the fees because servicing fees generally have the same standing as advances in that they are satisfied before any interest or principal is paid by the securitization trust on the bonds 
we estimate that for and  revenue excludes  and  respectively  of uncollected servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments 
as of december   we estimate that we had  of uncollected delinquent servicing fees that had not been recognized as revenue 
the increase in the average balance of loans serviced is the result of portfolio acquisitions coupled with reduced run off of the existing portfolio due to slower prepayment speeds 
mortgage prepayment speeds averaged in compared to an average of and for and  respectively 
the decline in mortgage prepayment speeds is largely due to credit tightening  rising subprime mortgage interest rates and slowing home price appreciation 
late charges are slightly lower in as compared in spite of the fact that delinquencies have risen and the average balance of the loan servicing portfolio grew by during this is because late charges are not recognized as revenue until they are collected 
the following table summarizes information regarding float earnings average custodial account balances float earnings yield the decline in float earnings in as compared to is due to a decline in both the average float balance and the average yield we earned on these funds 
the decline in the average balance of these accounts results from a decline in mortgage prepayment speeds and an increase in delinquencies  offset in part by the growth in the servicing portfolio 
the higher yield in as compared to reflects rising short term interest rates 
the underlying servicing agreements restrict the investment of float balances to certain types of instruments 
we are responsible for any losses incurred on the investment of these funds 
we generate float earnings through a facility provided by jpmorgan chase the investment line 
using the investment line  we borrow funds each month from jpmorgan chase at a nominal interest rate and invest those funds in certain permitted investments  including us treasury securities  us agency securities  commercial paper  auction rate securities  bank certificates of deposit and jpmorgan chase time deposits 
funds provided by the investment line are available only for investment purposes and are not available for general operating purposes 
the amount borrowed is based on projected average custodial balances for the month 
no actual custodial funds are invested  since we invest only the funds provided through the investment line 
the custodial funds remain on deposit with jpmorgan chase for the benefit of the securitization trusts 
the terms of the investment line require that we sell the investments and pay off the associated borrowings prior to the end of each quarter 
as a result  the investment line historically has had no impact on our quarterly balance sheets 
compensation and benefits expense 
the increase in compensation and benefits expense in is largely due to an increase in average employment in india where the average number of employees during the year grew from during to  during  an increase of 
average employment grew principally because of increases in staffing during in support of servicing portfolio growth 
in addition  we increased the number of higher paid loss mitigation staff in response to the increase in non performing loans 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense in occurred primarily due to a decline in the average number of employees in the us because of cost reduction initiatives put in place in  including a greater utilization of the lower cost workforce in india 
although average employment in india increased in  total average employment declined  and the ratio of india employment to total employment increased from in to in average employment in the residential servicing segment for the last three years is as follows india united states amortization of servicing rights 
we amortize mortgage servicing rights in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
slower actual and projected mortgage prepayment speeds have reduced the rate of amortization as we expect to earn the servicing income over a longer period of time 
despite a increase in the average balance of our investment in msrs  amortization expense for decreased by  or  as compared to in  the average balance of msrs increased by as compared to while amortization expense increased by only 
average prepayment speeds were  and for  and respectively 
servicing and origination expenses 
the principal components of servicing and origination expense are compensating interest satisfaction expense other the decline in compensating interest expense in and primarily reflects slower prepayment speeds 
in addition  during there was a shift towards a higher percentage of loans serviced under a mid month structure versus a calendar month structure 
under a calendar month structure  compensating interest is paid to the securitization trust for a full month of interest on all loans that prepay during the month 
under a mid month structure  we are not obligated to pay the compensating interest on prepayments that occur during the first half of the month 
other servicing and origination expense for includes  of expenses related to amounts due from borrowers that were subsequently deemed uncollectible 
these expenses primarily relate to serviced loans that paid off during professional services expense 
in  legal fees declined by  as compared to this decline is primarily due to the reversal of excess accruals on settled cases and the absence of an increase in accruals related to ongoing cases 
professional services expense for included a provision of  recorded to increase litigation accruals related to ongoing cases

other operating expenses primarily consist of overhead allocation charges and bad debt expense 
other operating expenses for reflect higher overhead allocation charges 
other operating expenses for reflect higher bad debt expense as a result of providing for aged reimbursable expenses 
interest expense 
the higher interest expense in and reflects an increase in financing costs associated with our servicing advances and msrs because of the growth in our investment in these assets and higher interest rates 
the average combined balance of advances and match funded advances was higher in than  and higher in than interest expense in was higher than both because of borrowings that were  or higher on average in than in and because the average rate on these borrowings increased by basis points  or 
average rates increased principally because of the higher spread over libor charged on the new match funded facilities added in and because of higher facility fees charged by the lenders

income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was   and  for  and  respectively 
the tax benefit primarily reflects the reversal of  of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  including  in the second quarter  in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance in  we primarily based our determination on the following cumulative taxable earnings in recent periods  positive outlook for future taxable earnings  the disposal of nearly all of our non core assets 
excluding the effect of the reversal of valuation allowances  our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
income tax expense benefit on income before income taxes differs from amounts that would be computed by applying the federal corporate income tax rate of primarily because of the effect of foreign taxes  foreign income with an indefinite deferral from us taxation  losses from consolidated vies  state taxes  low income housing tax credits and changes in the valuation allowance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of taxes at the statutory rate to actual income tax expense benefit 
our effective rate for excludes the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance but includes a reduction of for the anticipated use of tax credits during that year 
no such benefit is included in our effective tax rate for because we reversed the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during the second quarter of our effective tax rate for includes a benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets and associated with certain provision to return reconciling items recognized in the fourth quarter 
these reconciling items are a result of certain estimates we used in our year end tax provision for which we obtained additional information as part of the tax return preparation process 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds for liquidity are match funded liabilities lines of credit and other secured borrowings servicing fees  including float earnings payments received on loans held for resale payments received on trading securities debt securities our primary uses of funds are funding of servicing advances  purchases of msrs  the payment of interest and operating expenses and the repayment of borrowings 
our funding needs related to loan originations have declined significantly in as the result of our decision to close our subprime loan origination business 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements  and we invest available funds in short term investment grade securities 
at december   we had  of unrestricted cash  which represented of total assets 
we also had  of investment grade securities at december   of which  were sold under agreements to repurchase 
total cash and investment grade securities comprised of total assets at december   as compared to at december  we maintain and grow our residential servicing business primarily through the purchase of servicing rights or by entering into subservicing agreements 
servicing rights entitle us to earn servicing fees and other types of ancillary income  but they also impose on us various obligations as the servicer 
among these are the obligations to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest payments for certain investors and to pay taxes  insurance and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced 
most of our servicing agreements require that we remit contractual principal and interest payments to the securitization trusts even if the serviced loans are delinquent 
in addition  we are required to pay property taxes and insurance on mortgaged properties even if funds from the borrowers are not available to meet these obligations 
we also are required to use our own funds to process loan foreclosures and to maintain  repair and market properties held on behalf of the securitization trusts because of foreclosures 
as a result  rising delinquencies and declining prepayments in resulted in the balances of our advances growing at a faster rate than our servicing portfolio 
we currently use diversified sources of financing  including match funded lending agreements and secured credit facilities with various lenders and syndicates 
even though these arrangements recognize that advances have minimal credit risk due to their highest repayment priority in our servicing agreements  a financing discount is applied to the fair value of the advances and mortgage servicing rights that we pledge as collateral 
as a result  we must use internally generated cash to fund the financing discount associated with such servicing assets 
in  the amount that we funded internally increased largely because of the growth in advances 
furthermore  there was an increase in advances associated with loans and or securitizations that do not qualify for financing under the advance facility to which they are pledged 
we anticipated the recent turmoil in the subprime lending market and in  took steps to expand our existing credit facilities and to establish new facilities in order to meet increased demands for liquidity in our residential servicing operations 
maximum borrowing capacity of the residential servicing segment was  at december   an increase of  as compared to december  however  as a result of declines in loans held for resale and residual trading securities  the increase in total borrowing capacity in was  as we anticipated  rising delinquencies and declining prepayment speeds have resulted in increases in advances  increased interest expense related to advance financing  lower float balances and float income and revenue growth that has lagged behind the growth of our servicing portfolio 
delinquencies delay the collection of fees including servicing fees and late fees 
rising delinquencies also reduce the volume of loan payment collections from borrowers relative to the size of the servicing portfolio which results in relatively lower float balances and float income on such balances 
although we have been successful in negotiating increases in our sources of debt  our ability to sustain and grow our residential servicing business depends in part on our continuing success in maintaining and expanding sources of financing to fund servicing advances and in maintaining an average financing discount on advances and msrs at or near the current levels 
two of our match funded advance facilities that are rated by one or more rating agencies are subject to increases in the financing discount if deemed necessary by any agency in order to maintain the minimum rating required for the facility 
our senior secured credit facility is the only source of debt that is currently available to fund the purchase of msrs 
if we cannot replace or renew these sources as they mature or obtain additional sources of financing  we may be unable to acquire new servicing rights or make the associated advances 
although the market for advance financing has further tightened in  we expanded one of our match funded facilities in the first quarter of on february   we renewed and expanded the borrowing capacity under our match funded facilities from  to  we intend to renew or extend a  match funded advance facility prior to the beginning of its amortization period in march we are also in discussions with two banks regarding adding borrowing capacity to an existing match funded advance facility or creating a new match funded advance facility to provide added capacity if advances continue to grow  or if one or more of the facilities scheduled to amortize this year fails to renew in a timely manner 
there is a practical limit on our ability to finance operations and growth through the addition of debt  because some of our existing debt covenants limit our ability to incur additional debt beyond a certain level in relation to our equity and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity  among other requirements 
as a result of such limitations  if we were to close all the new match funded advance facilities and renew all existing facilities  we would still be unable to fully utilize our total available borrowing capacity 
as a result  taking operational steps to limit the growth of advances is also important 
due in part to the initiatives that we implemented late in  the rate of growth in our advances and delinquency rates has slowed through february  relative to the rate of growth experienced in the latter half of at february   total residential servicing advances were  as compared to  at december  at february   the percentage of the upb our residential servicing portfolio representing nonperforming loans was as compared to at of december  loan modifications have increased  and within the parameters provided by our pooling and servicing agreements  we expect to continue to modify loans when it is in the best interest of our investors to do so 
we also expect to more effectively market and price the foreclosed real estate in our residential servicing portfolio 
in  we expect that prepayment speeds will remain at or near current levels and that the growth rate of delinquencies and advances will continue to decrease 
however  if prepayment speeds further decrease in  or if the success of the loan modification programs diminishes  advances on the existing servicing portfolio will increase 
although the rate of growth of servicing advances has slowed and is expected to continue to slow  we expect total servicing advances to continue to increase and reach approximately  before balances begin to decrease in the second half of in order to fund this projected level of servicing advances  we will need to renew  replace or extend our  advance financing line that is scheduled to go into amortization in march and our  secured line of credit prior to its maturity date in august based on our active negotiations  we expect to renew or extend the  advance financing line prior to the amortization date in march we expect to renew our secured line of credit prior to its august maturity date 
we are also in active negotiations to secure additional advance financing capacity totaling  which we expect to close during the second quarter of if we are unable to renew our existing facilities and or obtain additional borrowing capacity  we may need to consider more aggressively selling non core assets  issuing subordinated debt or obtaining additional equity capital 
in the table below  we provide the amortization dates and maturity dates for each of our credit facilities as of december  the amortization date is the date on which the revolving period ends under our advance facilities and repayment of the outstanding balance must begin if the facility is not renewed or extended 
the maturity date is the date on which all outstanding balances must be repaid 
after the amortization date  all collections that represent the repayment of advances that have been financed through the facility must be applied to reduce the balance outstanding under the facility  and any new advances under the securitizations pledged to the facility are ineligible to be financed 
in order for us to maintain liquidity  advances under facilities that have entered their amortization period and have not been renewed must be repaid and pledged to another facility

total borrowings fair value adjustment borrowing capacity under a secured advance facility may only be utilized to the extent that underlying collateral is available to be pledged to that financing facility 
the  fixed rate term note issued in is carried on the balance sheet at fair value as the result of a designated fair value hedging relationship that we established through the use of an interest rate swap 
maximum borrowing through the variable funding note issued under this facility increased from  to  as a result of an amendment negotiated in april in november  we extended the maturity of the variable funding note for an additional year to november and increased the maximum borrowing from  to in january  we reduced the borrowing capacity from  to  and extended the maturity by one year to january in october  maximum borrowing under this facility was increased from  to  subsequently  on february   we negotiated a further increase in the maximum borrowing to  and extended the stated maturity to february in september  we executed a servicing advance securitization and issued a variable funding note under which we may borrow a maximum of  we intend to renew or extend this facility 
the interest rate increased from month libor plus basis points to month libor plus basis points on november  and to month libor plus basis points on january  in december  we executed a servicing advance securitization and issued a variable funding note under which we may borrow a maximum of  the interest rate for this note is determined using a commercial paper rate that reflects the borrowing costs of the lender plus a margin of basis points 
this rate approximated month libor plus basis points 
in august  the maturity of this agreement was extended to august and the maximum borrowing capacity was increased from  to  we intend to downsize this facility to  if  and when  a larger facility currently under ratings agency review is issued 
this agreement is secured by a rated securities issued in connection with the transfer of loan and real estate collateral to orealt  a bankruptcy remote vie that we consolidate 
we expect to market these securities to third parties as the credit markets begin to stabilize 
this agreement has no stated credit limit or maturity  however  each transaction matures and is renewed monthly 
certain of our credit facilities require that we maintain minimum liquidity levels  and we are in compliance with these requirements 
a number of our credit agreements mature at various dates during the next twelve months 
at december   we had an aggregate balance of  outstanding under agreements maturing within one year  subject to possible renewal and extension 
we have the following anticipated uses of cash cash requirements to fund increases in advances  the acquisition of additional servicing rights and the cash needs of our existing operations  and our commitment to invest an additional  in asset management vehicles 
in addition to the anticipated uses of cash identified above  and to the extent we have available funds  we will also consider additional strategic investments similar to osi and npl  additional acquisitions and additional common share repurchases 
we may also evaluate the retirement of our capital securities which became redeemable in whole or in part at our option beginning august  at a redemption price of 
from time to time  we may also repurchase our convertible notes on the open market 
during the second half of  disruption in global capital markets and increased funding requirements for servicing advances due to rising delinquencies and declining prepayments have negatively impacted our liquidity position 
in response to these events  we have increased borrowing capacity for servicing advances and have developed plans to ensure sufficient liquidity throughout these plans include renewing or replacing our existing financing facilities identified in notes and to our consolidated financial statements that either enter amortization or mature in  reducing the growth of servicing advances by implementing operational changes such as increased use of loan modifications  closing new advance financing facilities  selling non core assets  and evaluating issuing subordinated debt or preferred stock 
although successful execution cannot be guaranteed  management believes that the plans are sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
we expect to comply with all financial covenants during that time 
if we are unable to successfully implement these plans  or if unanticipated market factors emerge  it could have a material adverse impact upon our business  results of operations and financial position

the decline in net cash flows from operating activities in as compared to primarily reflects a significant reduction in proceeds from the sale and securitization of loans held for resale and increased funding requirements of the residential servicing business 
these reductions were somewhat offset by a decline in net cash used by trading activities 
loans held for resale provided used cash of   and  during  and  respectively 
the reason for this change is that in we decided to shut down our subprime origination business and de emphasize our loan purchase and securitization activities 
the funding requirements of our residential servicing business are reflected in the decrease in servicer liabilities and increase in servicing advances which collectively used  of cash in these same items used  and  of cash during and  respectively 
this change resulted from declining prepayment speeds and rising delinquencies 
trading activities provided used net cash of   and  in  and  respectively 
this change is due to the maturity of short term investment grade securities as a result of a decline in excess funds available to invest in such securities and the receipt of  from the sale of the uk residuals 
the net cash flows provided by operating activities in largely reflect the sale and securitization of loans held for resale  a significant portion of which were acquired in although net income for increased by  it included a tax benefit of  primarily reflecting the reversal of  of deferred tax asset valuation allowances

the convertible notes will mature on august  however  beginning august   we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash for a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
holders may also require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on august   august  and august  or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
a fundamental change is a change of control or a termination of trading in our common stock 
expected annual interest on the convertible notes is  expected annual interest on the capital trust securities is  actual interest on lines of credit and other secured borrowings was  in future interest could vary depending on utilization and changes in libor and spreads 
we have excluded match funded liabilities of  from the contractual obligation table above because it represents non recourse debt that has been collateralized by match funded advances which are not available to satisfy general claims against ocn 
holders of the notes issued by the spes have no recourse against any assets other than the match funded advances that serve as collateral for the securitized debt 
actual interest on match funded liabilities was  in future interest could vary depending on utilization and changes in libor and spreads 
we believe that we have adequate resources to meet all contractual obligations as they come due 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we engage in transactions with a variety of financial institutions and other companies that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
in addition  through our investment in subordinate and residual securities  we provide credit support to the senior classes of securities 
we are subject to potential financial loss if the counterparties to our off balance sheet transaction are unable to complete an agreed upon transaction 
we seek to limit counterparty risk through financial analysis  dollar limits and other monitoring procedures 
we have also entered into non cancelable operating leases and have committed to invest up to an additional  in asset management vehicles 
derivatives 
we record all derivative transactions at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we use these derivatives primarily to manage our interest rate and credit risks 
the notional amounts of our derivative contracts do not reflect our exposure to credit loss 
involvement with spes 
we use spes for a variety of purposes but principally in the securitization of mortgage loans and in the financing of our servicing advances 
our securitizations of mortgage loans have been structured as sales in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 
and the spes to which we have transferred the mortgage loans are qualifying special purpose entities qspes under sfas no 
and are therefore not subject to consolidation 
we have retained both subordinated and residual interests in these qspes 
where we are the servicer of the securitized loans  we generally have the right to repurchase the mortgage loans from the qspe when the costs exceed the benefits of servicing the remaining loans 
we generally use match funded securitization facilities to finance our servicing advances 
the spes to which the advances are transferred in the securitization transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements either because the transfer did not qualify for sales accounting treatment or because the spe is not a qspe and we have the majority equity interest in the spe or we are the primary beneficiary where the spe is also a vie 
the holders of the debt of these spes can look only to the assets of the spes for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
vies 
in addition to certain of our financing spes  we have invested in a number of other vies  primarily in connection with purchases of whole loans 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we report the vie in our consolidated financial statements

the asf framework and subprime arm loans in december  the american securitization forum asf issued the streamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans the asf framework 
the asf framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation procedures and to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention efforts including refinancings  forbearances  workout plans  loan modifications  deeds in lieu and short sales or short payoffs for certain subprime adjustable rate mortgage arm loans 
while there is no standard definition for subprime loans  we generally consider loans to borrowers with a credit score of less than to be subprime 
lenders typically assess higher interest rates and additional fees on subprime loans in order to compensate for the increased credit risk associated with this type of loan 
the framework applies to all first lien subprime arm loans that have a fixed rate of interest for an initial period of months or less  are included in securitized pools  were originated between january   and july   and have an initial interest rate reset date between january   and july  asf framework loans 
the framework categorizes the population of asf framework loans into three segments 
segment includes loans where the borrower is current and is likely to be able to refinance into any available mortgage product 
segment includes loans where the borrower is current  is unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily available mortgage industry product and meets certain defined criteria 
segment includes loans where the borrower is not current  as defined  and does not meet the criteria for segments or asf framework loans in segment of the framework are eligible for fast track modification under which the interest rate will be kept at the existing initial rate  generally for five years following the interest rate reset date 
the goal of the asf framework is to reduce the number of us subprime residential mortgage borrowers who might default because the borrowers cannot afford to pay the increased interest rate on their loans after their subprime residential mortgage variable loan rate resets 
in january  the sec s office of chief accountant the oca issued a letter the oca letter addressing accounting issues that may be raised by the asf framework 
the oca letter expressed the view that if a segment subprime arm loan is modified pursuant to the asf framework and that loan could legally be modified  the oca will not object to the continued status of the transferee as a qspe under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

the oca requested that the fasb immediately address the issues that have arisen in the application of the qspe guidance in sfas no 
we may make loan modifications in accordance with the asf framework in but do not expect them to have a material effect on our accounting for subprime residential mortgage loans or securitizations or retained interests in securitizations of subprime residential mortgage loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands market risk includes liquidity risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
market risk also reflects the risk of declines in the valuation of trading securities  msrs and in the value of the collateral underlying loans 
we are exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the highly variable daily cash requirements to support the residential servicing business including the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the process of remitting borrower payments to the custodial accounts 
in general  we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources including match funded agreements  secured lines of credit and repurchase agreements 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds  or different bases  than our interest earning assets 
our residential servicing business is characterized by non interest earning assets financed by interest bearing liabilities 
among the more significant non interest earning assets are servicing advances and msrs 
at december   we had residential servicing advances of  consisting of advances on loans serviced for others of  and match funded advances on loans serviced for others of  we are also exposed to interest rate risk because earnings on float balances are affected by short term interest rates 
these float balances  which are not included in our financial statements  amounted to approximately  at december  and averaged approximately  for the year we report these earnings as a component of servicing and subservicing fees 
partially offsetting this risk is the fact that a large component of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
therefore  declining rates will also reduce our interest expense for that financing 
at december   the combined balance of our match funded liabilities  debt securities  lines of credit and other secured borrowings totaled  of this amount  or  was variable rate debt  for which debt service costs are sensitive to changes in interest rates  and  was fixed rate debt 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the interest rate on  of our fixed rate debt to variable 
our balance sheet at december  included interest earning assets totaling  including  of investment grade securities and  of loans held for resale 
interest rates  prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans significantly affect both our initial and ongoing valuations and the rate of amortization of msrs 
as of december   the carrying value and estimated fair value of our residential mortgage servicing rights were  and  respectively 
we face little market risk with regard to our advances and match funded advances on loans serviced for others 
this is because we are obligated to fund advances only to the extent that we believe that they are recoverable and because advances generally are the first obligations to be satisfied when a securitization trust disburses funds 
we are indirectly exposed to interest risk by our funding of advances because approximately of our total advances and match funded advances are funded through borrowings  and most of the debt is variable rate debt 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non us dollar functional currency operations to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform an interest rate sensitivity analysis of our portfolio of msrs every quarter 
we currently estimate that the fair value of the portfolio decreases or increases by approximately and  respectively  for every basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
this sensitivity analysis is limited in that it was performed at a particular point in time  only contemplates certain movements in interest rates  does not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility  is subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and does not incorporate other factors that would impact our overall financial performance in such scenarios 
we carry msrs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value by strata 
to the extent that fair value were to decline below amortized cost  we would record an impairment charge to earnings and establish a valuation allowance 
a subsequent increase in fair value could result in the recovery of some or all of a previously established valuation allowance 
however  an increase in fair value of a particular stratum above its amortized cost would not be reflected in current earnings 
for these reasons  this interest rate sensitivity estimate should not be viewed as an earnings forecast

we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  we base expected maturities upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
we base the prepayment experience reflected herein on our historical experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from our historical experience

also during  the remaining interest rate swaps  eurodollar interest futures contracts and credit default swaps we had entered into to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk presented by our float earnings  loans held for resale and portfolio of residual and subordinate securities either had matured or were terminated 
at december   we had an open interest rate swap with a notional amount of  hedging our exposure to an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate match funded note due to declining interest rates 
we also had interest rate caps with a notional amount of  hedging our exposure to rising interest rates related to a variable rate match funded note issued in december see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our management of interest rate  credit and foreign currency exchange rate risk
