table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this annual report on form k 
overview historically  our quantitative radio audience measurement services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue 
our radio audience measurement services and related software revenues represented percent and nine percent  respectively  of our total revenue in both and while we expect that our quantitative radio audience measurement services and related software will continue to account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future  we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our revenue base by  among other things  leveraging the investment we have made in our ppm technology by increasing the international licensing and exploring applications of the technology beyond our radio audience measurement business 
we expect to continue our efforts to diversify revenue 
in and we entered into multi year agreements with many of our largest customers  including agreements for ppm based ratings as and when we commercialize the ppm service in the top us radio markets 
these agreements generally provide for a higher license fee for ppm based ratings than we charge for diary based ratings 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from our radio audience measurement and related software is likely to increase as we commercialize the ppm service 
due to slow economic growth of the radio industry generally  as well as the high penetration of our current services in the radio station business  we expect that our future annual organic rate of revenue growth from our quantitative diary based radio measurement services and related software will be slower than historical trends 
we anticipate that in the near term  organic revenue growth will only moderately exceed the level of contractual price escalators in our diary based radio ratings contracts 
concentration of ownership of radio stations in recent years has led to our increased dependence on a limited number of key customers for such services and related software 
for example  in  clear channel represented percent of our total revenue 
because many of our largest customers own and operate radio stations in markets that we expect to transition to ppm measurement  we expect that our dependence on our largest customers will continue for the foreseeable future 
we have begun execution of our previously announced plan to roll out progressively our ppm ratings service to the top us radio markets by the end of commercialization of our ppm ratings service requires  and we expect will continue to require a substantial financial investment 
while commercialization of the ppm ratings service will have a near term negative impact on our results of operations  which impact likely will be material  restoration of our operating margins following completion of the ppm transition process in the top us radio markets remains our goal  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
because many of our largest customers have committed to ppm based ratings  we also expect that much of our management focus in will be on continuously improving and successfully commercializing our ppm ratings service 
we anticipate that we will incur additional costs in related to new initiatives to improve the ppm service 
we continue to operate in a highly challenging business environment in the markets and industries we serve 
our performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in these markets and constituencies  including our ability to continue to maintain and improve both our diary service and our ppm service  design and recruit ppm panels that appropriately balance research quality  panel size  and operational cost  and develop and implement technological solutions to measure multi media and advertising 
stock repurchases on november   we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices over a period of two years through november as of october   the program was completed with  shares being repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 
table of contents million 
on november   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our outstanding common stock in like manner through november  as of february   no shares of outstanding common stock had been repurchased under this program

discontinued operation held for sale on january   we sold the continental research business 
additional information regarding the sale is provided in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
subsequent event project apollo on february  we announced that arbitron and nielsen  as sole members  had agreed to the termination of project apollo 
see item business national marketing research service project apollo 
although the plan for the winding down and liquidation of project apollo has not been finalized  we currently estimate that those expenses in will be approximately million to million 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that both are important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations  and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
we capitalize software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
we perform an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable that all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with our customer relationship management system due to the functionality being replaced by a new system 
as of december   and  our capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of software related to the ppm service 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets

revenue 
revenue increased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due primarily to million of increases related to the radio ratings subscriber base  contract renewals  and price escalations in multiyear customer contracts for our quantitative data license revenue  a million increase in scarborough revenue resulting primarily from new business contracts  and a million increase in ppm international revenues  partially offset by decreased national marketing pilot panel revenues  which due to the formation of project apollo llc in february  are now being recorded directly by the affiliate

cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in cost of revenue increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase in cost of revenue was largely attributable to an increase in our quantitative  qualitative and software application services of million  which was comprised substantially of a million increase in ppm service rollout costs largely associated with the management and recruitment of the ppm panels for the philadelphia  new york  los angeles  and chicago markets  a million increase in expenses associated with ppm ratings costs that were classified as research and development in and as cost of revenue in  a million increase in diary data collection and processing costs  and a million increase associated with response rate initiatives  a million increase in royalties  substantially associated with our scarborough affiliate  a million increase due to operating costs associated with the opening of a third participant interviewing center during the first quarter of  and a million increase associated with computer center costs

we record our share of project apollo s net operating results through the equity in net income of affiliates line of our consolidated income statement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent event project apollo for a description of the decision to terminate project apollo 
we expect that our cost of revenue will continue to increase as a result of our efforts to commercialize the ppm ratings service and support the rollout of this service over the next two to three years 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a million increase in expenses and amortization related to our accounts receivable and contract management system that was implemented during the second quarter of  a million increase in marketing communication costs  and a million increase in expenses for merger and acquisition advisory services incurred during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease associated with lower employee incentive plan expenses

borrowings under our new revolving credit facility did not commence until the fourth quarter of as a result  outstanding borrowings on average and the related interest expense were significantly lower during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations decreased for the year ended december   from the same period in  due primarily to planned expenses required to build our ppm rollout panels for the philadelphia  new york  chicago  and los angeles markets  and to support the strategic development of our ppm ratings business 
incremental expenses incurred in support of our diary ratings service and our project apollo national marketing research service also contributed to the decrease in income from continuing operations  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with our prepayment of our senior secured notes obligation in see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent event project apollo for a description of the decision to terminate project apollo

selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  and increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in approximately million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in our quantitative  qualitative and software application services  which includes a million increase in expenses associated with the update of our legacy financial and customer relationship management systems and increased sales and marketing costs of million related to our ratings business  including the ppm service 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  effective january   resulted in million of additional compensation expense related to our share based awards 
asset impairment charges related to internally developed software associated with the nielsen election not to join us in the commercial deployment of the ppm service accounted for million of the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses

net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to a million decrease in income from continuing operations  which resulted primarily

net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  the approximately million decrease was attributable to a million decrease in net sales of variable rate demand notes issued by municipal government agencies and auction rate securities for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in no auction rate securities were held at december  the repurchases of shares in and of million in aggregate  and the repayment of the million of senior secured note obligation in resulted in reduced available cash to invest in short term investments during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in increased capital spending of million  related primarily to purchases of computer equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  and a million investment in the project apollo affiliate paid during the year ended december   also contributed to the decrease in net cash flow attributable to investing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the million fluctuation was driven primarily by our million debt repayment made during the quarter ended december   of our then outstanding senior secured note obligation as compared with million of net borrowings in the year ended december   under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  a million increase in proceeds was received from stock option exercises for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  which was the result of higher average stock prices during the first six months of the year ended december  these increases in cash flow were partially offset by the million increase in stock repurchases 
on december   we entered into an agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide us up to million of financing through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the agreement contains an expansion feature that allows us to increase the financing available under the credit facility up to million 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility will be calculated based on a floating rate  which we can select for a duration of up to six months 
our credit facility contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict our financial flexibility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are required to maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios and meet other financial conditions 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants and limits  among other things  our ability to sell certain assets  incur additional indebtedness  and grant or incur liens on our assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  all of our material domestic subsidiaries  if any  guarantee the commitment 
currently  we do not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility agreement 
although we do not believe that the terms of the credit facility currently limit the operation of our business in any material respect  the terms may restrict or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt capital when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives 
as of february   we do not have any outstanding debt under the credit facility

commercialization of our ppm radio ratings service requires and will continue to require a substantial financial investment 
we believe we currently have sufficient cash as well as access to our existing credit facility to fund such requirements 
we currently estimate that the annual capital expenditures associated with the ppm ratings service commercialization for audience ratings measurement will be approximately million 
we also anticipate that  over the first two to three years of commercialization  our results of operations will be materially negatively impacted as a result of the rollout of our ppm ratings service 
the amount of capital required for deployment of our ppm ratings service and the impact on our results of operations will be greatly affected by the speed of the rollout schedule 
while commercialization of the ppm ratings service will have a near term negative impact on the company s results of operations  which impact likely will be material  restoration of our operating margins following the completion of the ppm transition process in the top us radio markets remains our goal  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case
