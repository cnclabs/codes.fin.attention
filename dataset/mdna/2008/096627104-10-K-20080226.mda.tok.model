item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  included in item  and with item a  risk factors 
overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed to own and operate the business conducted by our operating subsidiaries  including the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas 
we own and operate pipeline systems in the gulf coast states of texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama  and florida and which extend northeasterly through arkansas to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana  and ohio 
our transportation services consist of firm transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume actually transported  and interruptible transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used 
we offer firm storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
for the year ended december   the percentage of our total operating revenues associated with firm contracts was approximately 
we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas other than for system management purposes  but changes in the price of natural gas can affect the overall supply and demand of natural gas  which in turn does affect our results of operations 
we deliver to a broad mix of customers including ldcs  municipalities  interstate and intrastate pipelines  direct industrial users  electric power generation plants  marketers and producers 
in addition to serving directly connected markets  our pipeline systems have indirect market access to the northeastern and southeastern united states through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
our business is affected by trends involving natural gas price levels and natural gas price spreads  including spreads between physical locations on our pipeline system  which affects our transportation revenues  and spreads in natural gas prices across time for example summer to winter  which primarily affects our pal and storage revenues 
high natural gas prices in recent years have helped to drive increased production levels in producing locations such as the bossier sands and barnett shale gas producing regions in east texas  which has resulted in additional supply being available on the west side of our system 
this has resulted in widened west to east basis differentials which have benefited our transportation revenues 
the high natural gas prices have also driven increased production in regions such as the fayetteville shale in arkansas and the caney woodford shale in oklahoma  which  together with the higher production levels in east texas  have formed the basis for several pipeline expansion projects including those being undertaken by us 
wide spreads in natural gas prices between time periods during the past two to three years  for example fall to spring  were favorable for our pal and interruptible storage services during that period 
these spreads decreased substantially in  which resulted in reduced pal and interruptible storage revenues 
we cannot predict future time period spreads or basis differentials 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
earnings per unit we calculate net income per limited partner unit in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
in issue of eitf no 
 the eitf reached a consensus that undistributed earnings for a period should be allocated to a participating security based on the contractual participation rights of the security to share in those earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed 
our general partner holds contractual participation rights which are incentive distribution rights in accordance with the partnership agreement as described in item of this report under incentive distribution rights 
the amounts reported for net income per limited partner unit on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and  were adjusted to take into account an assumed incremental allocation to the general partner s incentive distribution rights 
payments made on account of the incentive distribution rights are determined in relation to actual declared distributions 
regulation under the ferc s regulations certain revenues that we collect may be subject to possible refunds to our customers 
accordingly  during an open rate case  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded considering regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
at december  and  there were no liabilities for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  neither of our operating subsidiaries is involved in an open general rate case 
sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires rate regulated public utilities to account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates 
in applying sfas no 
 texas gas records certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods 
gulf south does not apply sfas no 
 because certain services provided by it are priced using market based rates and competition in its market area can result in discounts from the maximum allowable cost based rates being granted to customers  such that the application of sfas no 
is not appropriate 
the storage facilities operated by our operating subsidiaries store gas that is owned by them as well as gas owned by customers 
due to its method of accounting for storage  volumes held on behalf of others by gulf south are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
consistent with the method of storage accounting elected by texas gas and the risk of loss provisions included in its tariff  texas gas reflects an equal and offsetting receivable and payable for certain customer owned gas in its facilities for certain storage and related services 
for further discussion of our gas in storage  please see note in item of this report 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and operating personnel and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the environmental protection agency  the ferc and other governmental authorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated environmental costs 
impairment at june   the carrying value of our magnolia storage expansion project was tested for impairment 
as a result of the impairment test  we recognized a million impairment charge representing the carrying value of the storage cavern 
in determining that the fair value of the cavern was zero  estimates and assumptions were made regarding the cash flows associated with the storage cavern disposal through sale or abandonment 
certain costs remain inestimable related to potential regulatory or contractual obligations associated with abandonment of the storage cavern 
we believe that alternative uses for the storage cavern may be possible in the hands of a third party  and will pursue these options with the lessor  however  we have assumed no future cash flows related to these options in our impairment analysis 
in assessing the carrying value of the other associated facilities which include pipeline  compressors and other equipment and facilities  we assumed that the facilities would be used in conjunction with a replacement storage cavern to be developed 
our expected cash flows related to the other facilities include the cost of developing a new cavern and revenues from the sale of storage services to third parties over the useful life of the asset 
if storage spreads were to compress appreciably or significant difficulties were to arise in the development of the cavern  the actual cash flows could differ materially from the expected cash flows used in assessing the carrying value of the facilities which could result in the recognition of an additional impairment charge 
if it is determined in the future that the assets cannot be used in conjunction with a new cavern  we may be required to record an additional impairment charge at the time that determination is made 
jackson storage gas loss our jackson  mississippi aquifer storage facility has a working gas capacity of approximately bcf and is primarily used for operational purposes 
in the fourth quarter  it was determined that  based upon tests used to estimate the amount of gas stored in the facility  gas loss had occurred in the range of to bcf 
as a result of the estimated gas loss  we recognized a charge of million to operation and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter this amount was determined by applying the carrying value of gas in the facility of per million british thermal units mmbtu  to the low end of the range of estimated gas loss of bcf 
an assessment is underway to determine whether the gas will need to be replaced in order to operate the facility and support pipeline operations 
a more comprehensive test of the field will be performed in the second quarter if the pending test results indicate that the actual gas loss is greater than the estimated bcf  this could result in a future adjustment to the estimate 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas no 
requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
we used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  and that estimated fair value was compared to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount at december   and accordingly no impairment was recognized 
judgments and assumptions were used in management s estimate of discounted future cash flows used to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit  including our five year financial plan operating results  the long term outlook for growth in natural gas demand in the us and systematic or diversifiable risk used in the calculation of the applied discount rate under the capital asset pricing model 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the united states such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the moody s aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplement our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve is applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve is developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody s investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s 
further information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is included in note in item of this report 
financial analysis of operations we derive our revenues primarily from the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas for third parties 
transportation and storage services are provided under firm and interruptible service agreements 
item  nature of contracts  contains more information about the nature of our revenues 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at gulf south s compressor stations  which is part of operation and maintenance expenses 
we charge shippers for fuel in accordance with each pipeline s individual tariff guidelines and gulf south s fuel recoveries are included as part of gas transportation revenues 
the following analysis discusses our financial results of operations for the years  and compared with our net income for the year ended december   increased million  or  from the primary drivers for the increase were higher revenues from strong demand for firm transportation services  including pipeline system expansion and related fuel revenues 
higher operating expenses driven by a variety of factors  mainly charges for impairment and remediation costs associated with certain assets  increased fuel and higher depreciation and amortization  were substantially offset by higher interest income 
the results were also favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of storage gas associated with a storage expansion project  which was accounted for as a reduction of operating expenses 
total operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million increase in gas transportation fees due to higher reservation rates  including million from new contracts associated with the carthage  texas to keatchie  louisiana pipeline expansion which was in service for all of  million increase in fuel revenues due to increased retained volumes from higher system utilization including amounts associated with pipeline expansion  and million increase from the settlement of a claim related to a firm transportation agreement in the calpine bankruptcy proceeding 
operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million loss from impairment of the magnolia storage facility in the second quarter  million in charges associated with offshore pipeline assets in the south timbalier bay area  offshore louisiana  including million related to re covering the pipeline and a million impairment charge  million increase in fuel costs due to an increase in gas usage  million increase in depreciation and amortization from increases in our asset base  million increase in property and other taxes due to increases in the valuation of our asset base  million increase related to termination of an agreement with a construction contractor on the southeast expansion project  and million decrease from a gain on the sale of gas associated with the western kentucky storage expansion project which was reported in net gain on disposal of operating assets and related contracts 
total other deductions declined by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decline is primarily due to an increase in interest income of million as a result of higher levels of invested cash which we accumulated through sales of our debt and equity to finance the cost of our expansion projects 
compared with our net income for the year ended december  increased million or from the primary drivers for the increase were higher pal  gas storage and gas transportation revenues and a change in tax status concurrent with our ipo in november  as a result of which we ceased recording a charge in lieu of income taxes in our results of operations 
total operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million increase in gas storage and pal revenues mainly due to favorable natural gas price spreads and volatility in forward natural gas prices  million increase in firm transportation revenues  excluding fuel  primarily due to higher reservation rates and additional capacity reserved by shippers due to increased production in the east texas region  and million increase due mainly to hurricane insurance recoveries received in and gas lost in related to hurricanes 
the increases were partly offset by million decrease in interruptible transportation revenues due in part to customers shifting to firm services and supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes  million decrease in fuel retained due to lower realized natural gas prices and reduced throughput  and million decrease in revenues from the amortization of acquired executory contracts 
operating costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to million increase in outside services and overheads mainly due to growth in operations and regulatory compliance  million from the sale of storage gas related to phase i of our western kentucky storage expansion project reported in net gain on disposal of operating assets and related contracts in  million higher employee benefits costs comprised mainly of million from the amortization of a regulatory asset for postretirement benefits as a result of the texas gas rate case settlement and million from a special termination benefit charge recorded as a result of the early retirement incentive program  and million from an increase in depreciation and amortization due to increases in our asset base and million increased expense from the lease of third party pipeline capacity 
the increases were partly offset by million decrease in hurricane related costs from million of hurricane related insurance recoveries recognized in and a reduction in hurricane related operating expenses from amounts incurred in  million decrease in company used gas due to operational efficiencies  lower natural gas prices and reduced throughput resulting in decreased usage 
total other deductions increased by million  or  of which million is primarily due to interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of new debt in november  offset by an increase in interest income 
liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our operating subsidiaries use funds from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital requirements  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under its revolving credit facility discussed below  to service its outstanding indebtedness and  when available  make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
our operating subsidiaries participate in a cash management program to the extent they are permitted under ferc regulations 
under the cash management program  depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements  boardwalk pipelines either provides cash to them or they provide cash to boardwalk pipelines 
maintenance capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and we expect to fund our maintenance capital expenditures of approximately million from our operating cash flows 
expansion capital expenditures expansion capital expenditures were  million  million and million in  and as discussed above in item  business expansion projects  we have undertaken significant capital expansion projects  substantially all of which have been or are expected to be funded with proceeds from equity and debt financings 
since our ipo through december   we have raised million through issuances of equity limited partnership units and contributions from our general partner and million through issuances of unsecured notes by us and our subsidiaries  as described below under equity and debt financing  and in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and million of borrowing capacity available under our billion revolving credit facility discussed below 
we expect to incur expansion capital expenditures of approximately billion in and approximately billion in to complete our pipeline expansion projects  based upon our current cost estimates 
however  as noted elsewhere in this report  we have experienced cost increases in these projects and various factors could cause our costs to exceed that amount 
we expect to finance our remaining pipeline expansion capital costs through equity financings and the incurrence of debt  including sales of debt by us and our subsidiaries  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as available operating cash flow in excess of our operating needs 
however  the impact of the cost increases we have experienced and may experience in the future to complete our expansion capital projects could adversely impact our financing costs  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see item a  risk factors we are undertaking large  complex expansion projects which involve significant risks that may adversely affect our business 
see also item pipeline expansion projects 
equity and debt financing in november  we completed an offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
the offering resulted in net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including million received from our general partner to maintain its interest in us 
after the offering  we have million common units and million subordinated units issued and outstanding  of which million common units are held by the public 
in august  we sold million of senior unsecured notes of gulf south due august   and million of senior unsecured notes of gulf south due august  we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses of million 
in march  we completed a public offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
we received proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including approximately million from the general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the proceeds of these offerings have been and will be primarily used to fund capital expenditures associated with our expansion projects 
in august  we entered into a treasury rate lock for a notional amount of million of principal to hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk free component of forward year interest rates through february  the reference rate on the treasury rate lock was 
on february   we paid the counterparty approximately million to settle the rate lock 
the treasury lock was designated as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  therefore the loss will be recognized in interest expense over the term of the related debt to be issued 
credit facility we maintain a billion revolving credit facility  which was increased from million in november  under which boardwalk pipelines  gulf south and texas gas each may borrow funds  up to applicable sub limits 
interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
under the terms of the agreement  each of the borrowers must maintain a minimum ratio  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the agreement  measured for the preceding twelve months  of not more than five to one 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the covenant requirements under our credit agreement and no funds were drawn under this facility 
however  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit under the facility for million to support certain obligations associated with the fayetteville lateral and gulf crossing expansion projects which reduced the available capacity under the facility by such amount 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of june  contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations as of december   by period in millions total less than year years years more than years principal payments on long term debt interest on long term debt capital commitments lease commitments total pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
the above table does not reflect commitments we have made after december   relating to our expansion projects 
for information on these projects  please read capital expenditures above 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to million increase in cash due to gas purchases made in  million increase in cash due to the timing of expenditures  and million increase in cash from the change in net income  excluding non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and recognition of previously deferred revenues 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased million to billion for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures mainly for our expansion projects 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to million increase in net proceeds from the sale of common units and related general partner capital contributions  million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  and million decrease in cash used from the payment of notes and other long term debt in these increases were partly offset by million increase in cash distributions to unitholders and the general partner 
impact of inflation we have experienced increased costs in recent years due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  benefits  materials and supplies  and property  plant and equipment ppe 
a portion of the increased labor and materials and supplies costs have directly affected income through increased operating and maintenance costs 
the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our ppe and materials and supplies is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable unless a rate case is filed 
however  cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  limit our ability to price jurisdictional services or products to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements  please read note in item of this report 
calpine energy services calpine settlement in and  calpine entered into two year transportation agreements with gulf south 
in december  calpine filed for chapter bankruptcy protection and in early discontinued making payments on one of the transportation agreements 
gulf south continued to invoice calpine under the transportation agreements and fully reserved the revenues associated with the contract on which calpine was not making payments 
in december  gulf south and calpine filed a stipulation and agreement with the bankruptcy court  which was approved in january  to terminate the firm transportation agreement on which calpine was delinquent  and to settle all of gulf south s claims in the bankruptcy proceedings for approximately million 
the claim was to be paid in the form of calpine stock  along with other general creditors having claims in the bankruptcy proceeding 
in january  we sold the bankruptcy claim to a third party and received a cash payment of approximately million 
the assignment is with recourse subject to the issuance of calpine stock in the full amount of the claim 
as a result of the settlement  in we recognized million in gas transportation revenues related to invoiced amounts past due  which were previously reserved 
the remainder of the settlement amount will be recognized upon full payment of the settlement amount by calpine 
forward looking statements investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this report  as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries during presentations about us  are forward looking 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may project  indicate or imply future results  events  performance or achievements  and may contain the words expect  intend  plan  anticipate  estimate  believe  will likely result  and similar expressions 
in addition  any statement made by our management concerning future financial performance including future revenues  earnings or growth rates  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible actions by our partnership or its subsidiaries  are also forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  among others we may not complete projects  including growth or expansion projects  that we have commenced or will commence  or we may complete projects on materially different terms  cost or timing than anticipated and we may not be able to achieve the intended economic or operational benefits of any such project  if completed 
the successful completion  timing  cost  scope and future financial performance of our expansion projects could differ materially from our expectations due to availability of contractors or equipment  weather  difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or denied applications  land owner opposition  the lack of adequate materials  labor difficulties or shortages  expansion costs that are higher than anticipated and numerous other factors beyond our control 
we may not complete any future debt or equity financing transaction 
the gas transmission and storage operations of our subsidiaries are subject to rate making policies and actions by the ferc or customers that could have an adverse impact on the rates we charge and our ability to recover our income tax allowance  our full cost of operating our pipelines and a reasonable return 
we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the environment and pipeline operations which may expose us to significant costs  liabilities and loss of revenues 
any changes in such regulations or their application could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured 
the cost of insuring our assets may increase dramatically 
because of the natural decline in gas production connected to our system  our success depends on our ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas  which is dependent on factors beyond our control 
any decrease in supplies of natural gas in our supply areas could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
successful development of lng import terminals in the eastern or northeastern united states could reduce the demand for our services 
we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates 
significant changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand  reducing system throughput and adversely affecting our revenues 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any forward looking statement is based 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt has been issued at fixed rates  therefore interest expense would not be impacted by changes in interest rates 
total long term debt at december   had a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
a basis point increase in interest rates on our fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in fair value of approximately million at december  a basis point decrease would result in an increase in fair value of approximately million at december  the weighted average interest rate of our long term debt was at december  in august  we entered into a treasury rate lock for a notional amount of million of principal to hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk free component of forward year interest rates through february  the reference rate on the rate lock was 
on february   we paid the counterparty approximately million to settle the rate lock 
the treasury lock was designated as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
 therefore the loss will be recognized in interest expense over the term of the related debt to be issued 
certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december   approximately million of gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  is exposed to commodity price risk 
we utilize derivatives to hedge certain exposures to market price fluctuations on the anticipated operational sales of gas 
in the second quarter  we entered into natural gas price swaps to hedge exposure to prices associated with the purchase of bcf of natural gas to be used for line pack for our gulf crossing and southeast expansion projects  approximately bcf of which remained outstanding at december  the derivatives were not designated as hedges in accordance with sfas no 
and were marked to fair value through earnings resulting in a loss of million for the year ended december  changes in the fair value of the derivatives will be recognized in earnings each quarter until settlement 
when the gas is purchased  the ultimate cost will be recorded to property  plant and equipment and recognized in earnings as the property is depreciated 
a increase in the price of nymex natural gas futures would result in the recognition of a million gain in earnings 
conversely  a decrease would result in the recognition of a million loss 
with the exception of the derivatives related to line pack gas purchases referred to above  the derivatives related to the sale or purchase of natural gas  cash for fuel reimbursement and debt issuance generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
and are designated as such 
the effective component of related unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values of the derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the deferred gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the anticipated transactions affect earnings 
generally  for gas sales and cash for fuel reimbursement  any gains and losses on the related derivatives would be recognized in operating revenues 
any gains and losses on the derivatives related to the line pack gas purchases would be recognized in miscellaneous other income  net 
the changes in fair values of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are expected to  and do  have a high correlation to changes in value of the anticipated transactions 
each reporting period we measure the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts 
to the extent the changes in the fair values of the hedge contracts do not effectively offset the changes in the estimated cash flows of the anticipated transactions  the ineffective portion of the hedge contracts is currently recognized in earnings 
if the anticipated transactions are deemed no longer probable to occur  hedge accounting would be terminated and changes in the fair values of the associated derivative financial instruments would be recognized currently in earnings 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
our exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and nns 
we maintain credit policies intended to minimize credit risk and actively monitor these policies 
natural gas price volatility has increased dramatically in recent years  which has materially increased credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries was trillion british thermal units tbtu and  assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of gas loaned out at december   would have been approximately million 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were invested primarily in mutual funds 
due to the short term nature and type of our investments  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our consolidated statements of income or cash flows to be materially impacted by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
during  we began investing in short term investments such as us government securities  primarily treasury notes  under repurchase agreements 
generally  we have engaged in overnight repurchase transactions where purchased securities are sold back to the counterparty the following business day 
pursuant to the master repurchase agreements  we take actual possession of the purchased securities 
in the event of default by the counterparty under the agreement  the repurchase would be deemed immediately to occur and we would be entitled to sell the securities in the open market  or give the counterparty credit based on the market price on such date  and apply the proceeds or deemed proceeds to the aggregate unpaid repurchase amounts and any other amounts owed by the counterparty 
we had no investments under repurchase agreements at december   however since then we have reinitiated our program of investing in short term repurchase agreements
