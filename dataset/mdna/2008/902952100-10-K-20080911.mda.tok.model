business segments us global  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments 
first  the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and second  the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
for more details on the results of our core operations  see note financial information by business segment 
the company generates substantially all its operating revenues from the investment management of products and services for usgif  usgaf collectively  the funds and three offshore clients 
although the company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segment  the company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments 
as of june   the company held approximately million in investments  comprising of its total assets 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 
investment management products and services investment management revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations 
during fiscal year  average assets under management increased to billion  primarily due to significant increases in the natural resource and foreign equity funds under management through both net inflows and market appreciation 
average assets under management dollars in millions change change usgif money market usgif other usgif total usgaf total sec registered funds other advisory clients average assets under management 
table of contents investment activities management believes it can more effectively manage the company s cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the company

as of june   and  the company held approximately million and million  respectively  in investments other than usgif  usgaf and offshore clients the company advises 
investments in securities classified as trading are reflected as current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair market value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
investments in securities classified as available for sale  which may not be readily marketable  are reflected as non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
investment income loss from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  realized foreign currency gains and losses  other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities  and dividend and interest income 
investment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations  the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities  and timing of transactions 
a significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers 
for fiscal years   and  the company had net realized gains losses of approximately   and  respectively 
the company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future 

table of contents consolidated results of operations the following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the company and a detailed discussion of the company s revenues and expenses

this decrease was due primarily to endeavour s exposure to junior natural resources stocks  which were adversely impacted by a market environment in which risk aversion increased and access to capital decreased 
other offshore performance fees decreased by approximately  or  to  the decrease in performance fees was slightly offset by an offshore management fee increase of  or  due to higher assets under management 
despite a volatile market  management fees benefited from a higher base level of assets under management from the prior year 
the company s sec registered advisory fees increased by million  or  primarily as a result of the positive impact of market gains and shareholder investments in natural resources and foreign equity funds 
offsetting these increases were overall declines in offshore advisory fees of million as described above  for a net decrease in advisory fees of million  or 
transfer agent revenues increased by  or  primarily as a result of growth in the number of shareholder accounts and a revised transfer agent fee structure  which incorporated transaction and activity based fees  platform fees increased by  or million  due to increased asset inflows through broker dealer platforms  driven by strong mutual fund and offshore fund performance  employee compensation expense increased by  or million  primarily due to higher salaries and incentive bonuses  consistent with continued growth in the eastern european fund  subadvisory fees increased by  or  and general and administrative expenses decreased  or  primarily as a result of decreased consulting and legal fees 
year ended june   compared with year ended june  the company posted net after tax income of  per share for the year ended june   compared with net after tax income of  per share for the year ended june  the increase in profitability in fiscal year primarily resulted from an increase of million in advisory fees and million in transfer agent fees

investment advisory fees 
investment advisory fees  the largest component of the company s revenues  are derived from two sources sec registered mutual fund advisory fees  which in fiscal accounted for of the company s total advisory fees  and offshore investment advisory fees  which accounted for of total advisory fees 
sec registered mutual fund investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of average net assets  ranging from to  and are paid monthly 
these advisory fees increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal over fiscal advisory fees benefited from an increase in assets  particularly in the foreign equity and natural resource funds 
the company has agreed to waive or reduce its fees and or pay expenses for several usgif funds and two usgaf funds  through november   and february   respectively  or such later date as the company determines for purposes of enhancing the funds competitive market positions 
the aggregate amount of fees waived and expenses borne by the company totaled approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
the company expects to continue to waive fees and or pay for fund expenses if market and economic conditions warrant 
however  subject to the company s commitment to certain funds with respect to fee waivers and expense limitations  the company may reduce the amount of fund expenses it is bearing 
mutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  which include market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts  client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed 
the boards of trustees of usgif and usgaf have called a special meeting of shareholders for september   to consider several proposals  including proposals to approve i a new advisory agreement for usgif and usgaf and ii a new distribution plans for the nine equity usgif and usgaf funds under which us global brokerage  inc would be paid a fee at an annual rate of 
table of contents of the average daily net assets of each fund 
a full discussion of the proposals is set forth in proxy materials filed with the sec by usgif and usgaf 
the proposed new advisory agreement for the nine equity usgif and usgaf funds provides for a base advisory fee that will be adjusted upwards or downwards by if there is a performance difference of or more between a fund s performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior months 
with respect to four equity usgif funds  the new advisory agreement also will increase the base advisory fee and make changes to the advisory fee breakpoints 
in addition  if the new advisory agreement is approved  administrative services that are part of the current advisory agreement will be removed and become the subject of a completely separate administration agreement 
under the administration agreement  usgif and usgaf would no longer reimburse the company for certain legal and administrative services  but instead would pay the company compensation at an annual rate of of the average daily net assets of each fund for these and other administrative services 
if approved  the company has agreed to cap the expenses of each fund for the first year going forward  the company and each fund s board of trustees would negotiate the amounts of these expense caps annually during the consideration of the renewal of the advisory agreement 
the company provides advisory services for three offshore clients 
the company receives a monthly advisory fee and a quarterly or annual performance fee  if any  based on the overall increase in value of net assets  and in the case of one client  based on a percentage of consolidated net income from operations in excess of a predetermined percentage return on equity 
offshore investment advisory fees decreased by million  or percent  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to potential market volatility  performance fees are subject to fluctuation based on factors that may be out of the company s control  and are not necessarily predictive of future revenue 
for more information  see item a 
risk factors and the section entitled revenue recognition under critical accounting policies 
transfer agent fees 
united shareholder services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  provides transfer agency and printing services for company clients 
the company receives an annual fee per account as well as transaction and activity based fees as compensation for services rendered as transfer agent  and is reimbursed for out of pocket expenses associated with processing shareholder information 
in addition  the company collects custodial fees on iras and other types of retirement plans invested in usgif and usgaf 
transfer agent fees are  therefore  significantly affected by the number of client accounts 
the increase in transfer agent fees in fiscal years and was primarily a result of an increase in the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts due to improved performance of the natural resource and foreign equity funds and the result of the revised fee structure effective april   which incorporated transaction and activity based fees 
investment income 
investment income loss from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  realized foreign currency gains and losses  other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities  and dividend and interest income 
this source of revenue is dependent on market fluctuations and does not remain at a consistent level 
timing of transactions and the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities largely affect this source of revenue 
investment income increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase can be attributed primarily to increases in unrealized gains on corporate investments 

table of contents investment income decreased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease can be attributed primarily to a  decrease in realized gains on corporate investments and a million decrease in unrealized gains on corporate investments  offset by a  increase in dividend and interest income 
included in investment income were other than temporary impairments of  and  for the fiscal years ending  and  respectively 
expenses dollars in thousands change change employee compensation and benefits subadvisory fees general and administrative platform fees advertising depreciation total employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits increased by million  or  in and million  or  in fiscal  primarily due to incentive bonuses associated with strong mutual fund performance  mutual fund asset growth  strong offshore advisory client performance and increased shareholder accounts 
subadvisory fees 
subadvisory fees are calculated as a percentage of average net assets of the two funds that are subadvised by third party managers 
the increases in subadvisory fees of 
million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  resulted primarily from growth in assets in the eastern european fund 
the subadvisory agreement related to the megatrends funds subsequently renamed the global megatrends fund was terminated effective september  general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of 
million  or  in fiscal year  resulted primarily from decreased consulting and legal fees 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million  or  in fiscal year is primarily attributable to increased consulting  legal  audit and accounting fees 
platform fees 
much of the mutual fund asset growth across all funds has been realized through broker dealer platforms 
these broker dealers typically charge an asset based fee for assets held in their platforms 
accordingly  net platform fee expenses have increased by million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
the incremental assets received through the broker dealer platforms are not as profitable as those received from direct shareholder accounts due to margin compression from paying platform fees on those assets 
advertising 
advertising expense was essentially flat in fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation 
depreciation expense increased by  in fiscal year and  in fiscal as a result of a slight increase in capital purchases 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes for temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and tax purposes  resulting from the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
for federal income tax purposes at june   the company has no capital loss carryovers

table of contents please refer to contractual obligations for a discussion on commitments related to the company s building renovation 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of security investments  income taxes  valuation of stock based compensation  revenue recognition on advisory contracts  related party transactions and recent accounting pronouncements 
security investments 
the company accounts for its investments in securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company classifies its investments in equity and debt securities based on intent 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each reporting period date 
securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings 
investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost 
the company currently has no investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities 
investments classified as neither trading securities nor held to maturity securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from earnings  reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders equity  and recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
the company evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
for available for sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income 
the company records security transactions on trade date 
realized gains or losses from security transactions are calculated on the first in first out cost basis  unless otherwise identifiable  and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
securities traded on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price 
securities for which over the counter market quotations are available  but for which there was no trade on or near the balance sheet date  are valued at the mean price between the last price bid and last price asked 
securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at management s estimate of fair value 
income taxes 
the company s annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its us and us entities which are part of the company s consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 

table of contents tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s consolidated tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock also create a difference between the tax rate used in the consolidated tax return and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 
the company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
judgment is used to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return 
these liabilities are adjusted  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
judgment is used in classifying unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits will generally be classified as a noncurrent liability because there will usually be a period of several years between the filing of the tax return and the final resolution of an uncertain tax position with the taxing authority 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which reserves have been established are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
stock based compensation 
the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r on july  under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
we measured the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal  and on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements
