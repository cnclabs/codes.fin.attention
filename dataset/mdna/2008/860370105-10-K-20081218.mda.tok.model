the investment committee of our board of directors has adopted an investment policy statement that provides guidance on security selection  emphasizes diversification and balances long term growth objectives with the need for current income 
the long term objectives are to preserve principal while seeking appropriate levels of current income and capital appreciation in order to provide returns that match or exceed inflation 
for additional information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item customization  personalization and packages 
our market research indicates that consumer preferences are shifting towards more personalized memorial services and merchandise in the context of both traditional burials and cremations 
we have responded to these changing preferences by  among other things  training our funeral arrangers to offer our customers a broad range of options  such as designing a funeral service to reflect the special interests or accomplishments of the deceased 
we developed a custom funeral planning program that as of was implemented in all of our funeral homes and is part of our regular training process 
we are also changing the way our product offerings are displayed at our locations  making it easier for our customers to appreciate our wider selection 
we continually evaluate our funeral packages which provides value to our families by simplifying the selection process while enhancing the services we provide 
we believe that our product and service offerings have enhanced the experiences provided to families at our funeral homes and have contributed to increased revenues per sale 
enhanced cremation and alternative service offerings 
in fiscal years  and  percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the funeral services we performed in our continuing operations were cremations 
a significant trend in the united states is an increasing preference of consumers for cremation 
according to industry estimates  percent of funeral services in the united states during resulted in cremations  and cremations are expected to represent percent of funeral services in the united states by the year all of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services 
while the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of a traditional full service funeral  we have found that these revenues can be substantially enhanced by our emphasis on customization 
for example  in addition to a personalized memorial service to celebrate the life of the deceased  an enhanced cremation may include a casket  an urn and a niche in a mausoleum or columbarium in which to place the remains 
we continue to market our products and services to address the rising demand for cremations 
our alternative service firms are generally located in leased premises and have lower overhead than traditional funeral homes 
these firms primarily offer direct cremations with limited additional products and services 
although death care arrangements at these locations are typically less expensive than services at a traditional funeral home  it is not our goal to be the low price leader in these markets 
management 
we have an experienced management team 
many of our divisional and regional managers owned and operated their own funeral homes and cemeteries and joined us when we acquired their business 
our management structure is designed to allow local funeral home directors and cemetery managers substantial flexibility in deciding how their businesses will be managed and how their products and services will be priced and merchandised 
at the same time  financial and strategic goals are established by management at the corporate level 
as of october   we were divided into two geographic operating divisions in the united states  each of which was managed by a division president and chief financial officer 
our operating divisions are further divided into regions  each of which is managed by a regional vice president 
during fiscal year  we named a senior vice president of operations to oversee both geographic operating divisions with the intent to further drive our best in class initiative and increase focus on improving operations 
the division presidents report to the senior vice president of operations 
we also have a corporate division  which manages our corporate services  such as accounting and treasury  information systems  human resources  training and communications  and a sales and marketing division responsible for sales teams in all operating divisions 
from time to time  we may increase  reduce or realign our divisions and regions 
centralized support services 
our shared services center  which we opened in  was developed for the standardization and centralization of all of our facilities administrative and support processes such as accounting  management reporting  payroll  trust administration  contract processing  accounts payable processing  accounts 
table of contents receivable collection and other services 
it allows us to decrease our costs without diminishing service by creating significant savings on items such as trust administration fees  travel expenses  office supplies  overnight delivery and long distance telephone services 
in  we instituted a centralized purchasing department to leverage our size and negotiate more favorable supplier contracts 
during  we implemented a new financial software system and in a new payroll system which have created efficiencies 
we are also implementing a new contract processing industry specific software system in that is expected to create further efficiencies 
as we look at our opportunities for growth  we expect to leverage the efficiencies that we have achieved through our shared services center and expect to manage much of our growth with our existing infrastructure 
additionally  we have a centralized formal training program and began implementation of a standardized marketing approach to enhance sales effectiveness 
financial information about industry and geographic segments 
for financial information about our industry and geographic segments for fiscal years  and  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item business strategy implement long term strategic plan 
our long term business strategy has three components our best in class initiative  our innovation initiative and our acquisition initiative 
our focus for fiscal year was on our best in class initiative 
this initiative aims to improve performance at the rooftop level by giving all managers the same key metrics by which they can measure their performance and by providing tools to facilitate the sharing of best practices by key metric across the organization 
for example  one of the key metrics is the change in the number of funeral calls 
if funeral calls are below expectations  our program provides various suggestions taken from our best performing locations that the manager can use to help grow funeral calls 
we will also seek to strengthen our performance oriented company culture and to refocus management time and attention on improving field operations 
the goal of our best in class initiative is to generate a higher return on assets and to grow profits and cash flow 
best in class focuses on increasing average revenue per event  improving field labor productivity  leaning initiatives to reduce overhead and looking at locations that are not producing acceptable levels of profitability to determine if changes can be made to achieve best in class results or if divestiture is the more prudent option 
we are also focusing more attention on improving cremation profitability 
we are allocating resources to train funeral directors with regard to cremation offerings and are focusing on improving product offerings and family presentations 
we have restructured our training department to better align our training with our best in class initiative and the use of empirical data for improvement opportunities 
we have established a continuous improvement department to coordinate and facilitate the increased focus on improving processes to eliminate waste and inefficiency 
efforts are presently focused on contract processing  which is our largest single company process  with many other initiatives in the pipeline 
we are analyzing performance at each rooftop and underperforming businesses will be analyzed for training needs  standardization of processes and implementation of best in class to improve results 
any potential future divestitures will be determined based on performance  demographics  and proximity to other locations 
our innovation initiative seeks to generate new tangential growth opportunities not tied to the growth of our base business 
we have begun to lay the ground work for this component of our strategic plan with our investment  along with other industry participants  in an internet start up company called tributes 
com 
the purpose of this initiative is to capture revenue and profit streams from the creation of meaningful  significant and lasting remembrances that either complement or substitute for obituary notices 
currently  stewart field locations incur labor costs for the development of obituary notices but do not receive any compensation from the publications that receive a fee for publishing the notice 
this initiative is intended to allow us to capture market share in the existing obituary revenue stream in each of the communities in which we operate 
while still in start up mode  we believe this initiative will have significant benefit to both stewart and the industry 
additionally  we are beginning other initiatives with the goal of generating new revenue and profit sources from web commerce 
we have modified web pages for all of our locations to further implement this initiative  and aim to expand our customer base beyond our at need or preneed customers to their relatives and friends or anyone who reaches our websites or visits our facilities 

table of contents our acquisition initiative is to acquire businesses and implement our best in class initiatives in these newly acquired businesses 
our acquisition initiative will be ongoing and will proceed as appropriate acquisition opportunities are identified 
we deliberately slowed investigation of businesses to acquire while the best in class initiative was being initially implemented  and plan to focus more attention on this initiative in fiscal year we will evaluate acquisition opportunities that make sense for our business strategy at prices we believe will result in satisfactory returns 
improve key metrics 
we continue to believe that increasing cemetery property sales  funeral calls and preneed funeral sales is important to the growth of our business 
these goals have been a key focus for the last four fiscal years  and we plan to continue to focus on them as we implement our best in class initiative 
we view preneed cemetery property sales as the catalyst for growth in our cemetery segment as they create a customer base for all our businesses 
these sales also result in high margins and produce positive cash flow 
we have transitioned to personalized selling  and in addition to responding to requests generated by our media campaigns  our sales people have been successful in obtaining referrals from their existing customer base  allowing them to assist new customers with their cemetery and funeral needs 
we continue to develop and implement strategies to drive at need and preneed funeral growth throughout our organization 
we are using the most successful tactics of our top performing funeral homes to develop strategies to drive funeral call growth throughout our organization with an increased focus on preneed funeral sales 
we believe that the continuous addition of preneed funeral contracts to our backlog is a primary driver of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes 
continue focus on improving cash flow and controlling costs 
we plan to continue our focus on improving our cash flow and controlling our costs by  among other things  obtaining volume discounts from suppliers and leveraging our operating costs through clustering and combination operations 
additionally  we have been incentivizing local managers to control costs by aligning their compensation more closely to the profitability of the locations they manage 
during  we established a director of purchasing position to leverage our size and negotiate more favorable long term contracts with our supplier base 
in  we completed the sale of million of convertible notes which will significantly decrease our future interest payments and improve cash flow 
in  we formalized a continuous improvement department aimed at creating efficiencies and reducing costs 
continue focus on customer and employee satisfaction 
part of our strategic plan focuses on putting people first customers and employees 
we have conducted market research to obtain a clearer understanding of customer service expectations and are measuring the results through one of our key metrics a customer service rating 
we also seek to enhance employee satisfaction through professional growth  which includes the implementation of a mentoring program and succession plan for all key employee positions 
we continue to invest in the professional growth of our employees through numerous programs 
maintain backlog through preneed marketing 
we consider maintaining our backlog through preneed marketing to be an integral part of our long term business strategy 
our primary objective is to balance our preneed sales levels and our cash investments while maintaining a sustainable and predictable level of growth in our backlog 
the aging of the population represents a significant opportunity for us to expand our customer base through preneed marketing  as persons over years of age are most likely to make these purchases 
deploy cash flow 
in evaluating our cash flow deployment opportunities  we generally intend to conserve cash until we are able to renew or replace our revolving credit facility which matures in november as of october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
while we have nothing drawn on our current facility  as of october   we do have million in letters of credit and a million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations related to funds we withdrew in fiscal year from trusts in florida 
we believe that the use of our cash to pay dividends  repurchase debt and stock  construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties and make acquisitions of or investments in death care or related business are attractive options 
we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions and investments is a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure

table of contents the death care industry industry consolidation 
death care businesses in the united states have traditionally been relatively small  family owned enterprises that have passed through successive generations within the family 
the decade of the s witnessed a trend of family owned firms consolidating with larger organizations  but this trend slowed dramatically in as the number of consolidators participating in the acquisition market declined  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursuing transactions at lower prices 
our industry continues to be characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations  with approximately percent of industry revenue being generated by independently owned operations 
we estimate that our industry  which consists of approximately  funeral homes and  cemeteries in the united states  collectively generates approximately billion in annual revenue 
large public death care companies have also experienced consolidation 
in  the loewen group  inc  at the time the second largest provider and a primary competitor for acquisitions  entered into bankruptcy proceedings 
in addition  equity corporation international  previously the fourth largest public death care company and another of our competitors for acquisitions  merged with service corporation international sci in the loewen group emerged from bankruptcy as alderwoods group  inc and was acquired by sci in november in june  we received an unsolicited proposal from sci to acquire all of our outstanding shares for per share in cash  which we subsequently rejected 
we then received another letter from sci dated july  offering per share in cash for all of our outstanding shares 
in october  sci withdrew its acquisition proposal 
during the s  we grew rapidly primarily through acquisitions of funeral homes and cemeteries both domestically and abroad  financed by new equity and debt capital 
we ceased our acquisition activity in and developed strategies for improving our cash flow and reducing and restructuring debt 
during fiscal year through fiscal year  we completed our transitional strategies of improving our cash flow  restructuring and reducing our debt and selling our foreign assets 
during fiscal years through  we sold underperforming assets  refinanced and further reduced our debt and implemented new strategies to improve operations 
we believe  at the appropriate pricing  that growing our organization through acquisitions can again be a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our existing infrastructure 
importance of tradition  barriers to entry 
we believe it is difficult for new competitors to enter existing markets successfully by opening new cemeteries 
the barriers to entry are lower on the funeral side 
entry into the cemetery market can be difficult due to several factors 
because families tend to return to the same cemetery for multiple generations to bury family members  it is difficult for new cemeteries to attract families 
additionally  mature markets  including many of the metropolitan areas where our cemeteries are located  are often served by an adequate number of existing cemeteries with sufficient land for additional plots  whereas land for new cemetery development is often scarce and expensive 
regulatory complexities and zoning restrictions also make entry into the cemetery market difficult 
finally  development of a new cemetery usually requires a significant capital investment that takes several years to produce a return 
continuing need for products and services  increasing number of deaths 
there is an inevitable need for our products and services 
although the number of deaths in the united states will reflect short term fluctuations  deaths in the united states are expected to increase at a steady  moderate pace over the long term 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase by approximately percent per year  from million in to million in furthermore  the average age of the population in the united states is increasing 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the united states population over years of age is expected to increase by approximately percent per year  from million in to million in we believe the aging of the population is particularly important because it expands our target market for preneed sales  as persons over the age of are the most likely group to make preneed funeral and cemetery arrangements 
growing demand for cremation 
a significant trend in the united states is an increasing preference of consumers for cremations 
the trend toward cremations has been a significant concern for traditional funeral home 
table of contents and cemetery operators because cremations have typically included few  if any  additional products or services other than the cremation itself 
for additional information  including information about our strategies to address this trend  see operations enhanced cremation and alternative service offerings above 
competition our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral home and cemetery firms 
we also compete with monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and crematories  and other non traditional providers of limited services or products 
discount retailers have begun marketing caskets at prices that are sometimes substantially lower than what we offer 
consumers also can now buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet 
market share for funeral services and cemetery property is largely a function of goodwill  family heritage and tradition  although competitive pricing  professional service and attractive  well maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important 
market share for funeral and cemetery merchandise is largely a function of price 
extensive marketing through media advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased in recent years  especially with respect to the sale of preneed funeral services 
traditional cemetery and funeral service operators face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
additional information about the trend toward cremation and our strategies to address that trend can be found under the heading operations enhanced cremation and alternative service offerings above 
regulation our funeral home operations are regulated by the federal trade commission the ftc under the ftc s trade regulation rule on funeral industry practices  cfr part the funeral rule  which went into effect on april   and was revised effective july  the ftc began reviewing the funeral rule in at which time it conducted hearings to receive input from industry and consumer groups 
the ftc has concluded its review and determined that no revisions to the existing regulation are required 
the funeral rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices 
the preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate  itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from misrepresenting legal  crematory and cemetery requirements  embalming for a fee without permission  requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation  and requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services 
our operations are also subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
for example  state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral homes and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities 
our embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
we have a department that monitors compliance  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the funeral rule and all such laws and regulations 
federal  state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations  some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the death care industry in general 
we cannot predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us 
employees as of october   we employed approximately  persons  and we believe that we maintain a good relationship with our employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions or collective bargaining units

risk factors cautionary statements our business is subject to significant risks 
we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements in this report and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business our earnings from our trusts can be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates  which can have a significant adverse effect on our gross profit  net earnings and cash flows 
because of our preneed sales activities and the related state trusting requirements that accompany preneed sales  our business is impacted by changes in financial markets 
we maintain three types of trusts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
our trust assets are generally invested in a mix of equity and fixed income securities  and dividend and interest earnings and investment gains and losses are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
generally  declines in market performance reduce the earnings in our trusts and reduce our earnings and cash flow 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise in the future and result in there being less funds available to defray the costs of cemetery maintenance 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by operating cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  our subsidiary iti earns trust management fees based on the fair market value of the trusts managed  therefore  declines in the value of the assets in the trusts decrease the amount of fees we collect and record for trust management 
in fiscal years  and  cemetery perpetual care trust earnings  funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust earnings and iti trust management fees comprised percent of our revenue and percent  percent and percent of our gross profit  for each respective year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of significant declines in the united states markets associated with a rapidly deteriorating economy  we experienced similar sharp declines in the fair market values of the equity investments in our trust portfolios 
the value of many corporate bonds and other fixed income investments also declined 
in addition  interest rates have declined  negatively affecting yields available to us for short term fixed income investments 
unless market conditions improve and the values of our trust investments increase substantially  we expect to report lower earnings and cash flow from our trusts and trust management in future periods 
based on market conditions and realized losses as of october   we believe the decrease in revenue from trust earnings recognized on delivery of preneed services and merchandise  cemetery perpetual care trust earnings and trust management fees for fiscal year could be as much as million  or approximately percent  of fiscal year revenue and approximately percent of fiscal year gross profit 
the preneed contracts we manage are long term in nature  and we believe the trust investments have the potential over the long term to appreciate in value 
however  whether they will appreciate and over what time period are unknown 
if market conditions deteriorate or we experience additional realized losses  the decrease would be higher 
additional information regarding our trusts and related risks are described in the risk factors that follow 

table of contents earnings in preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts may be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and will be reduced by declines in interest and dividend rates  resulting in lower future revenues and cash flows  and potential contract impairment charges 
declines in earnings in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts can cause a decline in our reported future revenues and cash flows 
with respect to these trusts  we defer recognition and generally withdrawal of dividends  interest income and realized earnings until the underlying product or service is delivered 
realized gains and losses generally have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  except to the extent there are tax consequences as described later in these risk factors 
dividends  interest income and realized gains and losses are allocated to the underlying contracts and will affect the amount of future revenue recognized  and cash withdrawn  at the time the specific contract is performed 
in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts  at october   the fair market value of the investments in the trusts of million was million lower than our original cost basis of million 
unrealized gains and losses are not allocated to contracts  however  over time  gains and losses realized are allocated to the underlying contracts and will affect the amount of earnings we recognize and cash we withdraw at the time the contracts are performed 
as of october   we had million in earnings that have been realized and allocated to contracts that we will recognize when the underlying contracts are performed 
therefore  significant unrealized losses in these trusts  if they do not recover over time  can limit future earnings available to us 
for fiscal year  funeral trust earnings amounted to million  and cemetery trust earnings amounted to million 
if the fair market value of these trusts were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services  we would record a charge to earnings to record a liability for the expected losses on the delivery of the associated contract 
as of october   no such charge was required 
for additional information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of critical accounting policies loss contracts included in item realized capital losses in preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  can cause increases in our current period effective tax rate and a reduction of our current period reported net earnings and a reduction in operating cash flows in future periods 
approximately one half of the october  fair market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts are trusts for which we are the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
in addition  we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes  while for book purposes they are deferred until the contract is performed 
for fiscal year  the trusts for which we are the grantor realized net losses of million  and the trusts for which the customer is the grantor realized net losses of million 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  can require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
during our fourth fiscal quarter of  we recorded a tax valuation allowance of million related to capital losses realized in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts for which we are the grantor for tax purposes 
essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will recognize more income and pay higher taxes for tax purposes than we will for book purposes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purpose until the underlying contract is performed 
as of october   we have approximately million remaining in unrealized losses in trusts for which we are the grantor  hypothetically  if all of these losses were realized at once  this would have resulted in an additional valuation allowance of approximately million  assuming a projected tax rate of percent 
we currently have only a limited amount of embedded capital gains that we can generate in our trusts 
also  we have utilized all previous capital gains recorded in tax year and prior tax years to offset capital losses carried 
table of contents forward from earlier years 
accordingly  if we experience additional realized losses in these trusts and do not have or expect to have future capital gains available within or outside the trusts to offset these losses  we would record additional valuation allowances and related reductions of net income 
earnings in cemetery perpetual care trusts may be reduced by declines in stock and bond prices and will be reduced by declines in interest and dividend rates  resulting in lower current and potentially future revenues and cash flows 
in addition  we may be required to fund realized net capital losses in these trusts  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flow 
pursuant to cemetery perpetual care contracts and laws  a portion  generally percent  of the proceeds from cemetery property sales is deposited into perpetual care trusts 
the income from these trusts  which have been established in most jurisdictions in which the company operates cemeteries  is used for maintenance of those cemeteries  but principal must generally be held by the trust in perpetuity 
the statutory provisions that create and regulate these trusts differ from state to state  as do the regulatory interpretations of the provisions 
the trusts are reviewed regularly by the state regulatory authorities 
we currently recognize and withdraw all dividend and interest income earned and  in states where it is permitted  realized net capital gains generated by cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the cash is used to defray the costs of cemetery maintenance 
therefore  declines in these eligible distributable earnings in cemetery perpetual care trusts would cause a decline in current revenues and cash flows 
likewise  sustained declines in these earnings would reduce future revenues and cash flows 
as a result  we would need to devote more of our cash flow from other sources to continue to maintain our cemeteries at the same level 
for fiscal  earnings in these trusts contributed million to cemetery revenue  including million in capital gains 
unless current market conditions improve substantially  we expect to report lower earnings from the trusts in the future 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  at october   the fair market value of our investments of million was million lower than our original cost basis of million 
if we realize losses in our cemetery perpetual care trusts and the fair market value of the trust assets is less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  some states may require us to make cash deposits to the trust to cover the net realized loss or may require us to stop withdrawing earnings until future earnings cover the net realized loss 
in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past  regulators may seek replenishment of the realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they cover the loss 
as of october   we have recorded a million estimated probable funding obligation as an increase in cemetery costs in fiscal as of october   we had unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states 
because all of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
in those states where realized net capital gains have not been withdrawn  due to the different laws and our practices in those states  we do not believe that we will be required to replenish the realized net capital loss  and have not recorded a funding obligation  however  it is possible that a regulator may disagree with our conclusion  and future funding obligations may exist 
as of october   the realized net capital loss in these trusts was million  and the unrealized capital loss was million 
our distributions from cemetery perpetual care trusts include net realized capital gains on investment sales in states where permitted 
if regulations in these states are changed to no longer permit withdrawal of realized capital gains  our cemetery perpetual care trust eligible distributable earnings may be reduced in the future  which would reduce our earnings 
in states where permitted  we withdraw and recognize as revenue net realized capital gains on investment sales in cemetery perpetual care trusts 
during fiscal year  we recognized and withdrew million of net realized capital gains in cemetery perpetual care trusts 
our portfolio mix in these states is more heavily weighted to investments that potentially generate capital gains  such as equities 
in states where we do not withdraw capital gains  our portfolio mix is more heavily weighted to fixed income type securities 
if states where capital gains are 
table of contents currently permitted to be withdrawn make changes in legislation or regulations to not allow capital gains to be withdrawn  our future revenues and cash flow may be reduced until we are able to replace some or all of the investments that potentially generate capital gains with ones that generate more ordinary income such as fixed income securities 
given current economic conditions and market values  we may not be able to make that shift quickly without triggering capital losses that could require funding obligations 
reduced market values of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts will also reduce our trust management fees 
the fees that our subsidiary  iti  collects for managing the trusts are based on the fair market value of the trusts as determined by quoted market prices 
thus as market values decline  the earnings iti collects and the cash we withdraw for managing the trusts is also reduced 
to the extent market values do not improve  we will earn less in iti fees than we have historically earned 
during fiscal year  iti trust management fees collected were approximately million 
our trust portfolio is invested in various sectors  some of which may be more susceptible to additional adverse impact from the current economic crisis 
as of october   approximately percent of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust portfolios and percent of our cemetery perpetual care trust portfolios are invested in the financials sector 
we also have concentrations in the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors  which includes united states automotive manufacturers 
the current economic crisis may result in greater declines to the fair market value of our investments in these and other sectors as compared to the performance of our overall trust portfolio and or market benchmarks  including the s p index 
each sector has particular risks associated with it  and depending on our asset allocation  sector mix  company specific information and future economic events  our portfolio could be at risk for further decline 
for additional information on the various sectors comprising our trust portfolio and related risks  see the section titled preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item a weakening economy could decrease preneed sales 
a reduction in discretionary spending could also decrease amounts at need customers are willing to pay  and could cause third party insurance providers that fund our insurance funded preneed funeral contracts to experience financial difficulties 
a weakening economy that causes customers to reduce discretionary spending could cause  and we believe has caused in the past  a decline in preneed sales  and could also decrease the amounts at need customers are willing to pay 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales and average revenue per at need event would reduce current revenue 
declines in preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales would reduce our backlog and could reduce our future revenues and market share 
a weakening economy could also impact our customers ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  increased bad debt and decreased finance charge revenue which would reduce future earnings and cash flow 
a weakening economy could also increase costs related to sales force turnover and commissions we are unable to recoup as contract cancellation rates increase 
if a contract is cancelled before collecting a specified amount  the related commission is charged back to the sales counselor 
if the sales counselor is no longer employed by us when the contract is cancelled  we are unable to recoup that commission 
some of the preneed funeral contracts we sell are funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers 
the net amount of these contracts that have not been fulfilled as of october  was million 
these contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  but we include them when we discuss our anticipated backlog or anticipated future revenue from preneed funeral sales 
approximately percent of these contracts have been funded by forethought life insurance company 
if forethought or other insurance companies that have issued policies to our customers experience financial difficulties  our potential future revenue associated with these contracts  and commissions we receive from selling these contracts  could be at risk 
for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies for insurance funded preneed funeral contracts  see note i to our consolidated financial statements included in item 
table of contents continued economic crisis and financial and stock market declines could reduce future potential earnings and cash flows and could result in future goodwill impairments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which eliminated goodwill in our eastern division cemetery segment 
as of october   goodwill amounted to million  consisting of million in the eastern division funeral segment  million in the western division funeral segment and million in the western division cemetery segment 
cemetery segments tend to be more sensitive to goodwill impairments with a heavier reliance on preneed sales which are impacted by changes in customer discretionary income 
if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues and increased costs or if the current economic conditions result in additional companies in which the trust portfolio is invested in filing for bankruptcy  we may have a triggering event which could result in further goodwill impairments 
although we do not have any significant outstanding long term debt maturities until  our senior secured credit facility matures in november servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt depends on our ability to generate cash flow 
this  to a significant extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on our meeting the financial covenants in our debt agreements 
our business may not generate cash flow from operations  and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on favorable terms  or at all 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
although we do not have any significant outstanding long term debt maturities until  our senior secured credit facility matures in november while we have nothing drawn  as of november   we do have million in letters of credit and a million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations related to funds we withdrew in fiscal year from trusts in florida 
we have entered into discussions with various banks to assess commitment levels  pricing and covenant expectations 
given the current credit market conditions  we expect a new revolving credit facility to be more expensive than our existing facility and have tighter covenants  including  potentially  more restrictive conditions on when we can pay dividends and repurchase stock 
while we expect to replace or renew the credit facility with acceptable terms  if we are unable to negotiate a facility at acceptable terms  we would be required to cover the letters of credit and may be required to cover the florida bond with existing cash on hand 
as of october   we had sufficient cash and cash equivalents of million to cover these funding obligations  but if current economic conditions do not improve and we are unable to secure a new facility  we will be required to continue to impose cost and cash savings strategies  which could result in the elimination of the dividend and a reduction in capital expenditures 
we have experienced a decline in funeral call volume for a number of years due to many factors  such as the number of deaths and competition in our markets  our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and various other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we experienced declines in same store funeral call volumes for a number of years due to many factors described elsewhere herein including the number of deaths  intense competition and our ability to identify changing consumer preferences 
from fiscal years to  we experienced same store funeral call volume changes of percent  percent  percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to increase same store funeral call volumes over the long term 
declines in same store funeral calls can adversely affect revenues and profits if not offset by increases in average revenue per call or alternative sources of revenue 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 

table of contents our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products including  in recent years  internet providers 
from time to time  this price competition has caused us to lose market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices  thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and backlog and potentially impact our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
discount retailers sell caskets at prices substantially lower than prices we offer 
consumers also can now buy caskets in funeral supply stores and directly from manufacturers  as well as over the internet 
competition from these sources could reduce our casket sales  which could adversely affect funeral revenues and margins 
increased advertising and better marketing by competitors  as well as increased offering of products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs or to decrease prices in order to retain or recapture market share 
in recent years  the marketing of preneed funeral services through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs necessary to respond to competition by varying the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on current cash flow and earnings 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services  which are generally paid on an installment basis  are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions and other costs to acquire the sale and the fact that a portion of the sales proceeds is required to be placed into trusts or escrow accounts 
we will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow would be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
increased costs may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
we may not be successful in maintaining our margins and may incur additional costs 
for example  we have experienced increased property and casualty insurance costs primarily as a result of hurricanes katrina  wilma and rita 
we have also incurred significant legal costs related to the unanticipated class action litigation  the sec investigation and an unsolicited acquisition proposal from service corporation international  which it later withdrew 
we will incur additional costs in fiscal year in conjunction with improving our business systems 
in addition  the cost of certain commodities  particularly copper  which represents a large component of our bronze markers sold in our cemetery business  increased significantly during our contract with our major casket supplier expires in october  and our ability to negotiate a new contract at favorable terms could impact future costs 
some of the costs impacting our business are largely beyond our control 
to the extent that we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers  they will have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flows 

table of contents our business is subject to the risk of losses due to hurricanes and other natural disasters 
our company is headquartered in the new orleans metropolitan area  and approximately of our funeral homes and of our cemeteries  along with our mausoleum construction and sales business  acme mausoleum  are located near the gulf coast in southern texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama and florida  along the eastern coasts of florida  and north and south carolina and in puerto rico 
these areas are periodically threatened by hurricanes  which can damage our properties  interrupt our business and disrupt the lives of our customers and employees 
we are also at risk for tornadoes at our locations in the midwestern united states and for earthquakes at our locations along the west coast of the united states 
in fiscal year  our business was adversely affected by hurricanes katrina  wilma and rita 
a significant portion of the loss we experienced due to hurricane katrina was covered by insurance  but we cannot predict the long term effects on our operations because of the economic conditions currently existing in the new orleans metropolitan area or the timing and amount of collection of any additional insurance recoveries 
in fiscal year  hurricane ike impacted our houston operations resulting in million of expense primarily for debris removal  clean up and repairs 
we are currently working on our insurance claim related to hurricane ike 
we have a recorded an estimated liability of million primarily related to certain unidentified contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses  and we may become aware of new information that would require us to increase that estimated liability 
from time to time  unidentified contracts are presented to us relating to contracts sold prior to the time we acquired certain businesses 
in addition  from time to time  we have identified in our backlog  certain contracts in which services or merchandise have already been delivered 
using historical trends  and statistical analyses  we have recorded an estimated liability for these items of approximately million as of october  we are in the process of implementing and testing a new contract processing system  which may cause us to become aware of other such contracts 
to the extent we are made aware of contracts that exceed the estimated liability recorded  or cause us to conclude that we should increase the estimated liability recorded  we would have to record a charge to earnings 
our chairman may have a significant and disproportionate influence on the outcome of election of directors and other matters presented for a vote of shareholders and this control may be exercised in a manner that may conflict with the interests of other shareholders 
as of october   our chairman  frank b 
stewart  jr  held  shares or approximately percent of our outstanding class a common stock and all of the  outstanding shares of our class b common stock 
there is no established public trading market for our class b common stock 
because each share of class b common stock is entitled to votes on all matters presented for a vote by our shareholders  mr 
stewart controls approximately percent of our total voting power  while holding approximately percent of our outstanding equity 
accordingly  mr 
stewart may have a significant and disproportionate influence over the election of directors and other matters requiring the affirmative vote of our shareholders and this control may be exercised in a manner that may conflict with the interest of other shareholders 
additionally  because louisiana law and our articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of two thirds of the voting power present to approve certain major transactions such as mergers and any amendments to our articles of incorporation  mr 
stewart may have the ability to prevent the consummation of such actions  even if they are recommended by our board of directors and favored by a substantial majority of our shareholders 
we may be unable to repurchase our percent senior notes and our senior convertible notes when required by the holders  or to pay the cash portion of the conversion value upon conversion of our senior convertible notes 
in addition  we are subject to counterparty risk on the call options relating to our senior convertible notes 
upon a change of control of our company as defined in the relevant indenture  holders of our percent senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their notes for cash at a price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  upon fundamental change events specified in the relevant indenture  holders of our senior convertible notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount 
table of contents of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
also  upon conversion of our senior convertible notes  we will be required to deliver to the holders a cash payment equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes being converted or the conversion value of the notes 
as a result  we may be required to pay significant amounts of cash to holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources to make these payments when due 
any inability to make these payments would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing these notes and would also cause cross defaults under the terms of our other debt agreements 
concurrently with the sale of our senior convertible notes  we purchased call options with respect to our class a common stock from merrill lynch international and sold warrants to merrill lynch financial markets  inc the counterparties obligations to us under the call options and warrants are guaranteed by merrill lynch co  inc by simultaneously purchasing the call options and selling the warrants  we have effectively increased the conversion premium on the senior convertible notes to percent above the market price of the class a common stock at the time of the offering 
the call options are expected to offset our exposure to dilution from conversion of the senior convertible notes because any shares we would be obligated to deliver to holders upon conversion would be delivered to us by the counterparty to the call options 
this obligation is dependent upon the financial viability of the counterparty and guarantor 
with the uncertainty in the united states financial markets  there are risks that the counterparty and guarantor may not remain financially viable or may seek bankruptcy protection 
if the counterparty and guarantor are relieved of or cannot perform this obligation  then at the time of conversion  we may be required to issue additional shares based upon the initial conversion price of the notes and cause further dilution to our shareholders 
the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold contemporaneously with the sale of our senior convertible notes may affect the trading price of our class a common stock and the value of the senior convertible notes 
the counterparties to the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold may engage in hedging activities and modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to the conversion or maturity of our senior convertible notes  and particularly around the time of any conversion of the notes 
these hedging activities may include purchasing and selling shares of our class a common stock  or other of our securities  or other instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments 
the effect  if any  of these activities on the trading price of our class a common stock or the senior convertible notes will depend in part on market conditions at the time and cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock and the value of the senior convertible notes 
for additional information about the call options we purchased and the warrants we sold  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item exercise of the outstanding warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
concurrently with the sale of our senior convertible notes  we sold warrants expiring in to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock at per share and warrants expiring in to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock at per share 
the warrants expiring in may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the senior convertible notes due in  and the warrants expiring in may not be exercised prior to the maturity of the senior convertible notes due in the warrants may be settled in cash at our election 
exercise of the warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the accounting method for our senior convertible notes will change beginning in fiscal year and will substantially increase our reported interest expense relating to the senior convertible notes 
in may  the final version of financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp no 
apb  was issued  and the new accounting rules will be effective for us beginning november  and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
fsp no 
apb clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash 
table of contents settlement  are not considered debt instruments within the scope of apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants apb no 
 and issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of those instruments by allocating the proceeds from issuance of the instrument between the liability component and the embedded conversion option ie  the equity component 
this allocation is done by first determining the carrying amount of the liability component based on the fair value of a similar liability excluding the embedded conversion option  and then allocating to the embedded conversion option the excess of the initial proceeds ascribed to the convertible debt instrument over the amount allocated to the liability component 
that excess is reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized as interest cost over the instrument s expected life using the interest method 
thus  the new accounting rules will substantially increase our reported interest expense relating to the senior convertible notes which are currently accounted for under apb no 
and will have an adverse effect on our reported earnings  which could be material 
however  the new accounting rules will have no impact on cash flows 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
we have no variable rate long term debt agreements besides our senior secured credit facility 
although we have no amounts currently drawn under the credit facility  any amounts borrowed in the future are subject to variable interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt or indebtedness incurred in the future  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share materially 
our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants under our senior secured credit facility and percent senior notes is dependent upon many factors 
covenant restrictions may also limit our ability to operate our business 
our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the percent senior notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries activities 
our senior secured credit facility limits  among other things  our and the guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and create liens on our assets 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility contains specific limits on capital expenditures 
furthermore  our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy periodic financial condition tests 
the indenture governing the percent senior notes restricts our and the guarantors ability to create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with other companies 
our and our subsidiaries future indebtedness may contain similar or even more restrictive covenants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information on our debt covenants 
these covenants may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
in addition  events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
we might not meet those covenants  and the lenders might not waive any failure to meet those covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default under such indebtedness 
if an event of default under our senior secured credit facility occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
any such declaration would also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the percent senior notes 
for additional information  see liquidity and capital resources included in item the payment of dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to uncertainties 
the declaration of dividends on our common stock in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted under our senior credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

table of contents we are a defendant in the litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item and other litigation in the ordinary course of business 
the outcome of litigation and investigations is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages  penalties or injunctive relief against us 
we may not be able to consummate significant acquisitions of or investments in death care or related businesses successfully 
although we have not made any significant acquisitions in recent years  we may in the future 
also  our innovation initiative calls for us to seek to generate new tangential growth opportunities but not tied to the growth of our base business 
any such acquisitions and investments have risks 
we may fail to identify suitable candidates  and even if we do  we may not be able to successfully complete the transaction or integrate the new business into our existing business 
we may not be able to find businesses for sale at prices we are willing to pay 
acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on our ability to enter new markets 
due in part to our lack of experience operating or investing in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than we have  such acquisitions or investments may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business is complex  and we have had significant changes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business 
no assurances can be given that we will not face similar issues in the future 
our industry is unusual because we often sell products and services many years prior to the time they are required to be delivered  and we are required by varying state laws to hold customer funds related to these sales in trust until the products and services are delivered 
the accounting for these unusual features is complex  and in recent years there have been periodic changes in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to our business 
some of these changes have made it difficult to compare results from one period to the next 
such changes have also increased our administrative costs 
we can give no assurances that we will not face similar issues in the future 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term  and reliable statistics on deaths in particular markets can be difficult to obtain 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline and could cause a decline in the number of preneed sales being delivered  both of which could decrease revenues 
although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths 
changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
however  generally the number of deaths fluctuates with the seasons with more deaths occurring during the winter months primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
we have experienced an increase in the proportion of lower priced  non traditional funeral services and direct cremations  which we believe is part of the continuing national trend toward increased cremation 

table of contents our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of deaths in the united states by the year  compared to percent in in fiscal years  and  percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the funeral services we performed in our continuing operations were cremations  and percent of those were direct cremations 
a full service cremation  which includes a funeral service  a casket and memorialization of the remains in a mausoleum or columbarium niche or a burial of the remains  can result in funeral and cemetery revenue and profit margins similar to those of traditional funeral services and burials  although the cemetery property sale revenue would generally be lower 
in contrast  a basic or direct cremation  with no funeral service or casket and no memorialization of the remains  produces no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues and profit margins for funeral operations when delivered through a traditional funeral home 
during fiscal years  and  we experienced a reduction in the proportion of full service traditional funeral services and cremations and an increase in the proportion of lower priced  non traditional funeral services and direct cremations 
a continuation of this trend would adversely affect the revenues and gross profits of our funeral and cemetery businesses 
to address this trend  we have been intensifying our efforts to market full service funerals and cremations 
in addition  the increasing trend towards cremations in the united states could cause us to lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
funeral homes and cemetery businesses must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the ftc  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  puerto rican and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
several jurisdictions and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  impose or increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations  our cash flows and our future prospects

the pro forma data presented for fiscal year is reported as if the fiscal year change in accounting principle had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year the decline in shareholders equity from october  to october  was primarily due to stock repurchases made under our current stock repurchase program which amounted to million during fiscal year  along with a net loss of million for fiscal year our backlog of preneed funerals is comprised of trust funded contracts and insurance funded contracts 
as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item  insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of october   our preneed funeral backlog is comprised of  preneed funeral trust funded contracts and  insurance funded preneed funeral contracts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care industry in the united states 
as of october   we owned and operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and puerto rico 
we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings  finance charges and trust management fees 
we also earn commissions on the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts that will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers when we act as an agent on the sale 

table of contents recent events for the fiscal year ended october   we increased our consolidated revenues million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to a million increase in funeral revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in cemetery revenue 
the increase in funeral revenue is primarily due to a percent increase in same store average revenue per funeral service  including trust earnings  while the number of our same store funeral services remained flat 
the decrease in cemetery revenue is primarily due to a decrease in cemetery property sales  net of discounts  however  we are currently promoting various incentive programs to stimulate cemetery property sales in the future 
our cash flow from operations remained strong at million for the year ended october  we had million in cash on hand at october   and no significant scheduled principal payments on our long term debt until  although our revolving credit facility matures in november  as discussed below 
during our fiscal year  and particularly during our fourth fiscal quarter  the united states and global economies experienced significant declines 
for example  from november  to october   the s p index declined percent from  to  and during our fourth fiscal quarter  the s p index declined percent from  to 
the s p index closed at on december  among other events  during our fourth fiscal quarter of  investment bank lehman brothers holdings  inc declared bankruptcy and several financial institutions failed  including washington mutual  inc  the largest bank failure in american history 
the united states federal government has provided financing to and invested in a number of financial institutions 
our trust accounts held securities issued by some of these companies that have been rendered worthless or practically worthless by these events  and we have treated these losses as realized 
primarily as a result of these developments  the value of our trust assets has declined sharply 
during fiscal year  we realized aggregate net losses of million in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and recorded a million tax valuation allowance 
in addition  we realized aggregate net losses of million in our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
we recorded a related charge for the estimated probable funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of million in certain of our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the magnitude of the market decline in such a short time frame  and the failure of several large financial institutions and the resulting substantial realized losses in our trusts were not anticipated 
in addition  the realized losses came at a time when we have limited unrealized gains against which to offset the losses 
typically  realized losses in our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts have no immediate impact on our reported results  however  in the fourth quarter of  the realized losses had an impact on our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts  as described above 
as a result of significant declines in the united states equity markets during our fiscal year  we experienced similar declines in the fair market value of our trust investment portfolios 
at october   the fair market value of our total trust investments was million less than our original cost basis of million 
as of november   the fair market value of our total trust investments was million 
the preneed contracts we manage are long term in nature  and we believe that the trust investments have the potential over the long term to appreciate in value 
however  whether they will appreciate and over what time period are unknown 
as of october   we had million in earnings that have been realized and allocated to contracts that we will recognize when the underlying contracts are performed 
we anticipate that the decline in the value of our trust investments will have several impacts on our company in the future 
unless the market values of our trusts increase substantially  we expect to report lower earnings from our trusts 
in addition  our trust management fees are based on the fair market value of the assets managed  therefore  we expect to report lower trust management fees 
in fiscal year  cemetery perpetual care trust earnings  funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust earnings and trust management fees comprised percent of our revenue and percent of our gross profit 
based on current market conditions and current realized losses  we believe the decrease in revenue from trust earnings recognized on delivery of preneed services and merchandise  cemetery perpetual care trust earnings and trust management fees for fiscal year could be as much as million  or approximately percent  of fiscal year revenue and approximately percent of fiscal year gross profit 
if market conditions deteriorate or we experience additional realized losses  the decrease in revenue could be significantly higher 
in addition  we expect to report lower cash flow from operations due to our estimated probable funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of million related to our cemetery 
table of contents perpetual care trusts and reduced earnings and realized gains that we can withdraw from our trusts 
we have recorded an estimated probable obligation to restore the net realized losses in our cemetery perpetual care trusts in states where we have previously recognized and withdrawn capital gains 
in addition  we may incur additional realized losses with impacts of the nature of those experienced during our fourth quarter 
our portfolio includes investments in the domestic automotive industry as further described in the section titled supplemental trust portfolio information provided below 
for a more detailed discussion of risks related to our trust investments  see item a 
risk factors 
the further weakened economy in the fourth quarter of fiscal year has negatively impacted cemetery property sales  particularly in our eastern division 
when we performed our evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  particularly taking into account the reduction in trust earnings  the estimated probable funding obligation related to the cemetery perpetual care trusts and the overall market performance  a noncash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the aggregated northern and central regions of the eastern division cemetery operating segment was required  which eliminated the goodwill in our eastern division cemetery segment 
there were no goodwill impairment charges for the years ended october  and as of october   we had million of goodwill  consisting of million of goodwill related to the western division funeral segment  million of goodwill related to the eastern division funeral segment and million of goodwill related to western division cemetery segment 
if current economic conditions worsen  causing decreased revenues and increased costs  or if the current economic conditions result in additional companies in which the trust portfolio is invested in filing for bankruptcy  we may have a triggering event which could result in further goodwill impairment 
cemetery segments tend to be more sensitive to goodwill impairments with heavier reliance on preneed sales which are impacted by changes in customer discretionary income 
accordingly  further economic and market declines would be more likely to result in an impairment of goodwill in our western division cemetery segment 
currently  the fair values of our funeral segments reporting units substantially exceed their book value 
current economic conditions have impacted our ability to timely close preneed sales 
for fiscal year  preneed cemetery property sales  net of discounts  declined percent  which decreases our cemetery revenue 
in addition  preneed funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales decreased percent for the fiscal year which does not impact current revenue  but reduces our backlog and could reduce our future revenues 
current economic conditions could also decrease prices at need customers are willing to pay  but we have not seen this trend occur through fiscal year we have no amounts drawn on our million revolving credit facility and no significant scheduled principal payments on our long term debt until fiscal year we also are not  and do not expect to be  in breach of any of the covenants in our debt agreements 
our current revolving credit facility matures in november while we have nothing drawn  as of november   we do have million in letters of credit and a million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations related to funds we withdrew in fiscal year from trusts in florida 
we have entered into discussions with various banks to assess commitment levels  pricing and covenant expectations 
given current credit market conditions  we expect a new revolving facility to be more expensive than our existing facility and have tighter covenants  including potentially more restrictive conditions on when we can pay dividends and repurchase stock 
while we expect to replace or renew the credit facility with acceptable terms  if we are unable to negotiate a facility at acceptable terms  we would be required to cover the letters of credit and may be required to cover the florida bond with existing cash on hand 
as of october   we had million of cash on hand to cover these funding obligations  but if current economic conditions do not improve and we are unable to secure a new credit facility  we will be required to continue to impose cost and cash savings strategies  which could result in the elimination of the dividend and a reduction in capital expenditures 
for additional discussion  see the liquidity and capital resources section below and item a 
risk factors 
as a result of the realized capital losses on investments in some of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts for which we are the grantor  we recorded a charge to tax expense of million related to a tax valuation allowance  which increased our reported tax expense by million and will reduce future operating cash flow as these contracts mature 
if additional capital losses are realized in trusts for which we are the grantor  we may be required to establish additional valuation allowances unless capital gains are generated in the future  reducing our reported net income and future operating cash flow

table of contents risk factors  overview of critical accounting policies and note to our consolidated financial statements 
general our focus for fiscal year has been our best in class initiative  which aims to improve performance at the individual locations by giving all managers the same key metrics by which they can measure their performance and by providing tools to facilitate the sharing of best practices by key metric across the organization 
we also seek to strengthen our performance oriented company culture and to refocus management s time and attention on improving field operations 
the goal of our best in class initiative is to generate a higher return on assets and to grow profits and cash flow at our existing funeral homes and cemeteries 
for additional information  see item business 
as part of best in class  we are also currently implementing continuous improvement initiatives 
during the third quarter of  we formalized a continuous improvement department which was formed to coordinate and facilitate the increased focus on the strengthening and streamlining of our processes to eliminate waste and inefficiencies 
our results can be affected by the number of deaths in our markets 
the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase at a steady  moderate pace over the long term  however  the number can fluctuate from market to market and period to period 
although we have experienced a decline in funeral service volume for several years  our funeral service volumes have remained flat from fiscal year to fiscal year for additional information  see item business 
we are addressing funeral service volumes through our best in class initiative and enhanced sales and marketing efforts for both at need and preneed sales 
families have been showing an increasing preference for cremation 
this trend has been a significant concern for traditional funeral home and cemetery operators like us because cremations have typically included few  if any  additional products or services other than the cremation itself  and can result in lower revenue and profits than traditional services 
for additional information  see item business 
to address this trend  we have increased our efforts to market full service funerals and cremations 
other efforts to increase our funeral and cemetery revenue include our funeral package pricing and our emphasis on personalization and customization 
for additional information  see item business 
we are also increasing our focus on expanding the types of death care products and services we offer our customers 
for the year ended october   we achieved a percent increase in our average revenue per traditional funeral service and a percent increase in our average revenue per cremation service 
in addition  the cost of certain commodities  particularly copper  which represents a large component of the bronze markers sold in our cemetery business  increased significantly for most of our fiscal year  although commodity prices began declining in september of the current fiscal year 
in the first quarter of  we were impacted by escalating merchandise and energy costs  and we have taken steps to counter this impact 
some of the costs impacting our business are largely beyond our control 
to the extent that we are unable to continue to pass these cost increases on to our customers  they will have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flows 
financial summary of fiscal year for the year ended october   net earnings decreased million to a net loss of million from net earnings of million for fiscal year earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year decreased million to a net loss of million from net earnings of million for the prior year 
revenue from continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended october  funeral revenue from continuing operations increased million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year for the year ended october   our same store funeral operations achieved an increase in average revenue per traditional funeral service of percent and an increase in average revenue per cremation service of percent due primarily to the continued refinement of new funeral packages and pricing 
these increases along with a year over year increase in funeral trust earnings resulted in an overall increase in our same store average revenue per funeral service of percent 
our same store funeral services performed remained flat for fiscal year compared to fiscal year cemetery revenue from continuing operations decreased million from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october  this decrease is due primarily to an million  or percent  decrease in cemetery property 
table of contents sales  net of discounts  due to current economic conditions 
in addition  we experienced a million decrease in construction on various cemetery projects 
these decreases were partially offset by a million  or percent  increase in cemetery merchandise delivered and services performed  a million increase in cemetery commission income related to a new program to manage the cemetery sales at eleven archdiocese of los angeles cemeteries and a million increase related to the leasing of our mineral rights at one of our cemeteries to an outside third party 
consolidated gross profit decreased million to million primarily due to a million decrease in cemetery gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in funeral gross profit 
cemetery gross profit decreased primarily due to the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of for our estimated probable funding obligation to restore the net realized losses in certain of our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal year we incurred million in hurricane related charges in fiscal year compared to million in hurricane related charges for fiscal year interest expense for the period decreased million to million for fiscal year as a result of the million senior convertible note transaction in june  we recorded a million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt during our weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to million shares for the year ended october  compared to million shares for  yielding a positive impact on earnings per share 
for the year ended october   we had a percent decrease in net preneed funeral sales and a percent decrease in cemetery property sales  net of discounts  compared to the same period of last year due to current economic conditions 
goodwill declined million due to an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year income tax expense increased million due in part to a million valuation allowance recorded on the unrealized capital loss carryforward of million  attributable to the write down of investments of certain trusts and due in part to the fact that million of the goodwill impairment charge was not tax deductible 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended october  was million compared to million for fiscal year primarily due to an increase in net tax refunds in the current year 
for the year ended october   we spent million under our current stock repurchase program 
preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 

for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes i  j  k  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery services and merchandise backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this is made up of approximately billion from trust and billion from insurance 
this represents the face value of the backlog taking into account current realized earnings not yet recognized and current unrealized gains and losses plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the estimated build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
in addition  the analysis assumes a weighted annual return of percent projected from our trusts over the expected life of the contracts and a percent build up from the insurance contracts 
actual 
table of contents results could differ from our assumptions used in the calculation 
proceeds of these insurance policies may be used by customers for other purposes and are portable to other funeral service providers or for completely separate purposes 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue  was approximately billion 
supplemental trust portfolio information we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
the size of the trusts depends primarily upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of dividend and interest income and investment gains or losses  and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
as of october   approximately percent of our portfolio was invested in cash  percent in fixed income securities  percent in preferred stocks and percent in common stock 
because approximately percent of our total trust portfolio is currently invested in common stock  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to improve if the performance of the overall stock market improves  but we would also expect its performance to deteriorate if the overall stock market declines 
the following table presents the overall annual realized return in our domestic trusts for the years to the above returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
the table below presents our returns including realized and unrealized gains and losses 
funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts perpetual care trusts for the year ended october  for the last three years ended october  for the last five years ended october  for the last ten years ended october  in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts  at october   the fair market value of the investments in the trusts was million lower than our original cost basis 
for additional detail  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in our cemetery perpetual care trusts  at october   the fair market value of our investments was million lower than our original cost basis 
for additional detail  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the unrealized losses at october  of million  securities representing unrealized losses totaling million were also in a loss position at october   up from million at the end of last year 
the increase in these losses is partly a result of the dramatic declines in the equity markets in the latter part of fiscal for each of these securities  we evaluate consensus analyst recommendations  ratings from established ratings agencies and overall market performance 
most of our common stocks are part of the s p index  and all preferred stocks and corporate bonds had a rating of a or better at the time of purchase 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents within the trusts and from cash deposits of future preneed sales and cash received from ordinary income to fund future services and allow us to hold these investments until they recover in value 
while the unrealized loss has increased  based on review of the individual securities  we do not believe the loss on these securities should be realized 
of the million  approximately percent  or million  were 
table of contents generated by preferred stock investments and percent  or million  were generated by common stock investments 
the market value of these securities represents approximately percent of the market value of the securities in our trust portfolio 
the preferred stocks are primarily in the financial services sector which has experienced a significant decline in market value due to the current economic crisis 
our investment committee  which provides oversight for the trust portfolio management  believed that preferred stocks presented an attractive investment layer in our portfolio as they involved less risk than common equities and often produced returns more similar to and higher than fixed income securities 
the vast majority of these companies were rated a or better at the time of purchase by s p  moody s or fitch  and most continue to pay dividends 
although we cannot predict future stock prices  our management expects that the financial services sector and the s p will recover and that these stocks may recover along with them 
we believe we have the ability and intent to hold these investments for the forecasted recovery period

we generate revenue related to the trusts from investment management fees earned by our subsidiary  iti 
in fiscal year  these fees amounted to million 
these fees are based on the fair market value of the investments in the funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust portfolio and cemetery perpetual care trusts  and significant changes in the fair market value of the portfolio impact the fees earned 
to the extent the fair market values of our trust assets continue to be less than those values prevailing during  we will recognize less revenue from iti fees than we earned in and than we have historically earned 
impact of preneed sales on near term cash the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the timing of the tax payments on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contracts such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover 
table of contents the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially  but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
commissions related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales are expensed as incurred 
cash flows related to earnings in our trusts  deposits and withdrawals and related matters and our cemetery perpetual care funding obligations are described in notes  and of the consolidated financial statements 
overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by preneed funeral trust and preneed cemetery merchandise trust accounts until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered 
unrealized capital gains and losses are not allocated to contracts 
perpetual care funding obligation certain states allow us to withdraw realized capital gains from cemetery perpetual care trusts  and other states prohibit these withdrawals 
these earnings and related funds are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs and are recorded as revenue 
in the event that we have been allowed to withdraw realized gains and there are realized losses in the trust  we may determine we have a funding obligation to restore the net realized losses of the trust 
a charge is recorded in the statement of earnings at the time it is considered probable that we will be required to restore the realized losses 
loss contract analysis each quarter we perform an analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position  which would necessitate a charge to earnings 
for this analysis  we determine which trusts are in a net loss position by comparing the aggregate market value of the trust s investments with the aggregate actual cost basis of the investments 
if the aggregate cost basis exceeds the aggregate market value of the investments  the trust is 
table of contents considered to be in a net loss position 
for trusts in a net loss position  we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and net realized earnings  then subtract net unrealized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for contracts associated with the trusts in question as of that particular balance sheet date 
we look at unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments  but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis 
we compare the amount of proceeds to the estimated direct costs to deliver the contracts  which consist primarily of funeral and cemetery merchandise costs and salaries  supplies and equipment related to the delivery of a preneed funeral contract 
if a deficiency were to exist  we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our backlog 
due to the positive margins of our preneed contracts and the trust portfolio returns we have experienced in prior years  there is currently capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would result 
variable interest entities we consolidate our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies after the implementation of fin r including our policy for determining whether a loss in an investment in our trust portfolio should be considered realized  see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item concurrently with the adoption of fin r  we changed our accounting for insurance funded preneed funeral contracts  which are not recorded on our balance sheet  as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for doubtful accounts and sales cancellations management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of historical collection and write off experience 
in addition  we establish a reserve for sales cancellations for cemetery property sales based on historical cancellations and recent write off activity 
this reserve is recorded as a reduction in cemetery revenue 
we also establish an allowance for cancellations of insurance and third party commissions based on historical experience for cancellations of insurance contracts within the period of refundability 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily using the straight line method 
buildings and building improvement items are generally depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
equipment is generally depreciated over the following ranges light equipment  to years  heavy equipment  years  computer equipment  to years  and crematory equipment  to years 
vehicles are generally depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 
valuation of goodwill in our determination of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes  both qualitative and quantitative characteristics are evaluated 
gross margins are analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not 
table of contents our operating divisions are considered economically similar 
our division presidents also review a variety of metrics when assessing the performance of our regions 
qualitative factors include the nature of our products and services  consistency of products and services and the delivering of those products and services in our funeral homes and cemeteries  the similarity of class of customers across all locations and regulations in different jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation  we have reporting units 
because goodwill impairment tests are applied at the reporting unit level  a change in reporting unit can have a material effect on the outcome of the test 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we first compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying amounts including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value  we then measure the amount of impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination 
that is  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
we determine fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
from time to time  we may obtain assistance from third parties in our evaluation 
the discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
we test our results by comparing them to the trading multiples of companies in our industry and supplier industries calculated as enterprise value divided by ebitda 
we also reviewed multiples used in recent acquisition transactions 
in projecting our cash flows we used growth rates of three to five percent 
we adjusted the results for our estimate of the impact of the realized losses in our trusts on our cash flows 
for the discount rate  we used percent  which reflected our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and our supplier industries and capital structure as adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting units over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years 
the terminal value is calculated as the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period divided by the discount rate minus terminal growth rates ranging from to percent 
we considered sensitivities within the terminal values and used the midpoint enterprise value as our best estimate 
step two of our impairment test involves determining estimates of the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
we may obtain assistance from third parties in assessing the fair value of certain of our assets  primarily real estate  in performing our step two analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  including if we project lower cash flow in the future for a reporting unit than we projected when we performed our fiscal impairment test  we may be required to record an additional impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax 
table of contents assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the following items are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required net operating losses federal  state and united states possessions  capital loss carry forwards and deferred tax assets federal  state and united states possessions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
approximately one half of the october  fair market value of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts are in trusts for which we are the grantor 
for these trusts unlike the remaining trusts for which the customers are the grantors  we retain the income tax characteristics of all earnings as realized in the trust 
for example  capital gains and losses in the trusts are capital gains and losses on our tax returns 
in addition  we must recognize these earnings currently for tax purposes  while for book purposes they are deferred 
realized capital losses in the trusts for which we are the grantor  if we have or expect insufficient offsetting capital gains  can require us to record a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset capital loss carryforward  which increases our current period effective tax rate and reduces our current period reported net earnings 
during our fourth fiscal quarter of  we recorded a tax valuation allowance related to capital losses realized in our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts for which we are the grantor for tax purposes 
essentially  the current period valuation allowance reflects the fact that  if we cannot generate capital gains in the future against which to use the tax benefit of the capital loss which is limited to five years  when we perform the contract  we will recognize more income and pay higher taxes for tax purposes than we will for book purposes 
this tax relationship does not occur with respect to trusts for which the customer is the grantor  because all of their earnings are service revenue and thus ordinary income to us  and we do not recognize the revenue for either tax or book purposes until the underlying contract is performed 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
fin during the first quarter of fiscal year fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions or revenue deferrals that are not certain 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before to the extent tax  interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions in the future  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of tax expense  interest expense or other expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies but below our deductible 
historical insurance industry experience indicates some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with the types of claims covered by the program 
this is especially true due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate the receivables due from our insurance carriers as well as loss estimates associated with claims and losses related to these insurance coverages with information obtained from our primary insurer 
with respect to health insurance that covers substantially all of our employees  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible 
table of contents amount being covered by insurance 
expected claims are based on actuarial estimates  actual claims may differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained from our insurer 
assumptions used in preparing these estimates are based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness 
together these factors will generally affect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these evaluations are used to assess the reasonableness of our insurance loss liability 
the estimated liability on the uninsured litigation and employment related claims are established by management based upon the recommendations of professionals who perform a review of both reported claims and estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims 
these liabilities include the estimated settlement costs 
although management believes estimated liabilities related to uninsured claims are adequately recorded  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded liabilities 
we also have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incurred due to damage caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters 
our policy is to record such amounts when recovery is probable  which generally means we have reached an agreement with the insurance company 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we accrue for legal costs related to loss contingencies as the services are provided 
if a settlement is determined to be probable  then an estimate is recorded for the settlement at that time

as a result of the million senior convertible note transaction in june  we recorded a million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt during fiscal year the effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended october  was percent compared to percent for the same period in the increased rate in was primarily due to the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  of which million was non deductible for tax purposes 
this increase was coupled with a million valuation allowance recorded on the unrealized capital loss carryforward of approximately million  net of capital gains  attributable to the write down of investments of certain trusts which are recognized for tax purposes and deferred for book purposes 
we concluded a valuation allowance for the capital loss carryforward was necessary because it was uncertain whether we could generate any taxable capital gains within the carryforward period 
the reduced rate in was primarily caused by a tax benefit of million attributable to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward  coupled with a tax benefit of million attributable to the completion and settlement of an audit by the commonwealth of puerto rico for tax periods  and as of november   we adopted fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions or revenue deferrals that are not certain

funeral gross profit from continuing operations decreased from million in the year ended october  to million in the year ended october  due primarily to the decreases in revenue discussed above and a million increase in expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance costs  along with a million impairment charge related to funeral licenses in the state of maryland 
prior to october  funeral licenses in the state of maryland were restricted to a specific number that had previously been limited under maryland law 
the law changed in october  and these restrictions are no longer in place  therefore  the value of these assets has been impaired  and an impairment charge was recorded 
segment discussion funeral funeral revenue in the eastern division funeral segment increased primarily due to an increase in the same store average revenue per funeral service of percent 
the increase in average revenue is partially offset by a percent decrease in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses

the increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance costs along with a million impairment charge for funeral licenses in the state of maryland  as described above 
funeral gross profit for the western division funeral segment decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above without a corresponding decrease in expenses 
expenses for the western division funeral segment would have decreased more significantly were it not for an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance

consolidated operations cemetery cemetery revenue from continuing operations increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in  primarily due to an increase in construction during the period on various cemetery projects and an increase in gross cemetery property sales 
the increase is due in part to serving customers interested in large cemetery property purchases such as private estates 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in merchandise delivery revenues due in part to a decrease in interments and an increase in the reserve for cancellations  which was due in part to an improvement in the reserve for cancellations in the prior year following hurricane katrina

the timing of the receipt of insurance proceeds is not in line with the timing of cash spending related to hurricane katrina 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average interest rate during the year 
the decrease in the average rate is primarily due to additional interest incurred in fiscal year on the company s percent senior notes as a result of the company s inability to timely complete a required exchange offer and due in part to the reduction in interest resulting from the issuance of million of senior convertible notes 
the effective tax rate for our continuing operations for the year ended october  was percent compared to percent for the year ended october  the reduced rate in fiscal year was primarily caused by a tax benefit of million attributable to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward  coupled with a tax benefit of million attributable to the completion and settlement of an audit by the commonwealth of puerto rico for tax periods  and for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item as of october   our outstanding debt totaled million 
on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of percent senior convertible notes due and million aggregate principal amount of percent senior convertible notes due as part of this debt transaction  we prepaid the remaining balance of our term loan b for million  sold common stock warrants and purchased call options resulting in a net cash outflow of million and recorded debt issuance costs of million

also  as part of this debt transaction  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for million in negotiated transactions which reduced our shareholder s equity 
preneed sales into and deliveries out of the backlog preneed funeral sales decreased percent for the year ended october  compared to the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a decline in preneed funeral sales in our eastern division due to the selection of a new preneed insurance vendor and increased regulatory requirements for licensing 
the revenues from our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results presented above 
we added million in gross preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog including million related to insurance funded preneed funeral contracts during the year ended october  to be recognized in the future net of cancellations as these prepaid products and services are delivered  compared to gross sales of million including million related to insurance funded preneed funeral contracts for the corresponding period in deliveries out of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog  including accumulated trust earnings related to these preneed deliveries  amounted to million for the year ended october   compared to million for the corresponding period in  resulting in net increases in the backlog of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general we generate cash in our operations primarily from at need sales  preneed sales that turn at need  funds we are able to withdraw from our trusts and escrow accounts when preneed sales turn at need  monies collected on preneed sales that are not required to be trusted and cemetery perpetual care trust earnings 
over the last five years  we have generated more than million each year in cash flow from operations 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements with cash flows from operations 
we believe that our current level of cash on hand  projected cash flows from operations and available capacity under our million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  although we will need to renew or replace our revolving credit facility which matures in november and will need to refinance long term debt becoming due in through  as described below 
as described above in the section overview recent events  during our fiscal year and particularly during our fourth fiscal quarter  the united states and global economies experienced substantial declines 
the anticipated future effect of these events on our cash flow is described in that section and in item a 
risk factors 
we have initiated discussions with members of our bank group regarding the renewal of the million revolving credit facility which matures in november while we have nothing drawn as of october   we do have million in letters of credit and a million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations related to funds we withdrew in fiscal year from trusts in florida 
as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
given current credit market conditions  we expect a new revolving credit facility to be more expensive than our existing facility and have tighter covenants  including  potentially  more restrictive conditions on when we can pay dividends and repurchase stock 
we have entered into discussions to assess commitment levels  pricing and covenant expectations 
while we expect to renew or replace the current credit facility with acceptable terms  if we are unable to negotiate a facility at acceptable terms  we would be required to cover the letters of credit and may be required to cover the florida bond with existing cash on hand 
as of october   we had sufficient cash on hand to cover these funding obligations but if current economic conditions do not improve and we are unable to secure a new credit facility  we will be required to continue to impose cost and cash savings strategies which  for example  could result in the elimination of the dividend  reduced capital expenditures and other cash savings steps 
our availability under the revolving credit facility  after giving consideration to aforementioned outstanding letters of credit and bond  was million as of october  our million senior notes are not redeemable by us until february  and mature on february  we also have million in senior convertible notes  half of which mature in and the other half of which mature in see the table below under contractual obligations and commercial commitments for further information on our long term debt obligations 

table of contents we plan to conserve our cash pending the renewal or replacement of our revolving credit facility 
otherwise  we plan to continue to evaluate our options for deployment of cash flow as opportunities arise 
we believe that the use of our cash to pay dividends  repurchase debt and stock  construct funeral homes on cemeteries of unaffiliated third parties and make acquisitions of or investments in death care or related businesses are attractive options 
we believe that growing our organization through acquisitions and investments is a good business strategy  as it will enable us to enjoy the important synergies and economies of scale from our infrastructure 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require us to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue additional debt or equity financing 
we currently pay quarterly cash dividends of two and one half cents per share on our class a and b common stock  which amounted to million for year ended october  although we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future  the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by the board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
we also have a million stock repurchase program  of which million remains available as of october  repurchases under the program are limited to our class a common stock  and are made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deemed appropriate  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
cash flow comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year our operations provided cash of million for the year ended october   compared to million for the corresponding period in the increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to million in net tax payments made in fiscal year compared to million in net tax refunds received in fiscal year  which included approximately million in tax refunds in compared to million in refunds in we expect to be a cash tax payer in fiscal year the timing of additional refunds cannot be predicted at this time  although we continually review our tax planning strategies looking for opportunities 
these increases are partially offset by million of business interruption insurance proceeds and million of insurance proceeds  net of expenses  related to hurricane katrina  received in fiscal year in addition  in fiscal year  we withdrew million of unusual trust withdrawals related to the deferred revenue project and received million due to the execution of a lease of our mineral rights at one of our cemeteries to an outside third party 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in the change is primarily due to the fact that we purchased several properties in resulting in a net cash outflow of million compared to million in and due to a decline in capital expenditures related to hurricane katrina 
for the year ended october   capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for growth initiatives  million related to hurricane katrina and million related to the implementation of new business systems 
for the year ended october   capital expenditures were million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for growth initiatives  million related to hurricane katrina and million related to the implementation of new business systems 
in the year ended october   there were no insurance proceeds related to hurricane damaged properties compared to million in the same period in our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in this change is primarily due to net debt proceeds of million million in proceeds of long term debt and million in repayments of long term debt in there were million in debt repayments in in june  we issued million in senior convertible notes 
as part of this debt transaction  we prepaid the remaining balance of our term loan b for million  sold common stock warrants and purchased call options resulting in a net cash outflow of million and recorded debt issuance costs of million 
also  as part of this debt transaction  we 
table of contents repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for million  compared to million in cash outflows related to our current stock repurchase program in comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year our operations provided cash of million for the year ended october   compared to providing cash of million for the corresponding period in the change in operating cash flow is due to cash inflows of million of extraordinary trust withdrawals in compared to cash inflows of million for trust withdrawals in related to the deferred revenue project 
also  million of net tax payments were made during the year ended october  compared to million of net tax payments for the comparable period in due to a net operating loss carryforward utilized in fiscal year there were million of net cash inflows recorded related to hurricane katrina in compared to million of cash outflows in the timing of receipt of insurance proceeds does not match the timing of cash spending related to hurricane katrina 
lastly  we received million due to the execution of a lease of our mineral rights at one of our cemeteries to an outside third party 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in for the year ended october   capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for growth initiatives  million related to hurricane katrina and million related to the implementation of two new business systems 
for the year ended october   capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures  million for growth initiatives and million related to hurricane katrina 
we also purchased several properties in fiscal year resulting in a net cash outflow of million 
for the year ended october   there was a net cash inflow of million for insurance proceeds related to hurricane damaged properties compared to million as of october  our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash outflow of million for the comparable period in this change is primarily due to net debt proceeds of million million in proceeds of long term debt and million in repayments of long term debt in fiscal year compared to million of debt repayments in fiscal year a million unscheduled term loan b payment was made during the second quarter of in june  we issued million in senior convertible notes as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item as part of this debt transaction  we prepaid the remaining balance of our term loan b for million  sold common stock warrants and purchased call options resulting in a net cash outflow of million and recorded debt issuance costs of million 
also  as part of this debt transaction  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for million  compared to million in stock repurchases for the same period in under our stock repurchase program in effect at that time 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october   our outstanding debt balance totaled million 
we have contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under existing contractual arrangements

our future minimum lease payments as of october  were million  million  million  million  million and million for the years ending october      and later years  respectively 
we have entered into non competition agreements with prior owners and key employees of acquired subsidiaries that expire at various times through during fiscal year  we decided to relieve some of the prior owners and key employees of their obligations not to compete  however  we will continue to make the payments in accordance with the contract terms 
this category also includes separation pay related to former executive officers 
the following table details our known potential or possible future cash payments related to various contingent obligations as of october  expiration by period fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years contingent obligations total thereafter cemetery perpetual care trust funding obligation long term obligations related to uncertain tax positions in those states where we have withdrawn realized net capital gains in the past from our cemetery perpetual care trusts  regulators may seek replenishment of the realized net capital losses either by requiring a cash deposit to the trust or by prohibiting or restricting withdrawals of future earnings until they cover the loss 
the estimated probable funding obligation in the cemetery perpetual care trusts in these states was million as of october   and we recorded this as an increase in cemetery costs in fiscal year as of october   we had unrealized losses of million in the trusts in these states 
because all of these trusts currently have assets with a fair market value less than the aggregate amounts required to be contributed to the trust  any additional realized net capital losses in these trusts may result in a corresponding funding liability and increase in cemetery costs 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item  we adopted the provisions of fin on november  in accordance with the provisions of fin  we recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties
