koppers arch s results of operations have been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
previously  we had not been recognizing amounts related to asset retirement obligations 
under the new accounting method  we now recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
basic and diluted earnings per share related to the change in accounting principle were per common share 
in connection with our initial public offering in february  costs totaling million were incurred for a related call premium on the senior secured notes million  the write off of deferred financing costs million  the termination of the saratoga partners iii  lp advisory services contract million and payment of bond consent fees million

 after giving effect to the for one stock split 
cash dividends declared per common share  earnings per common share and weighted average common shares outstanding give effect to a for one stock split in january koppers holdings inc annual report item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  rubber and steel industries 
we serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  which includes manufacturing facilities located in the united states  australia  china  the united kingdom and denmark 
we operate two principal businesses carbon materials chemicals cm c and railroad utility products r up 
we believe that our cm c business is the largest distiller of coal tar in north america  australia  the united kingdom and scandinavia 
we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote and phthalic anhydride  which are critical intermediate materials in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
we believe that our r up business is the largest north american supplier of railroad crossties 
our other commercial wood treatment products include the provision of utility poles to the electric and telephone utility industries 
our cm c business has entered into a number of strategic transactions during the last two years to expand and focus on its core business related to coal tar distillation and derived products 
in november  tangshan koppers kailuan carbon chemical company limited tkk was established which will construct and operate a new tar distillation facility in the hebei province near the jintang port with a distillation capacity of  metric tons 
we hold a percent investment in tkk which is expected to commence production in in december  we announced the approval of a project to expand the capacity of our existing percent owned tar distillation plant in tangshan  china from  metric tons to  metric tons 
the expansion is expected to become operational in late in july  we sold our percent interest in koppers arch investments pty limited and its subsidiaries koppers arch to arch chemicals inc for net cash proceeds of million and recognized a gain from the sale  net of tax  of million 
effective as of this date  koppers arch was classified as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations and earnings per share and our financial statements have been accordingly restated 
koppers arch was a manufacturer of timber presentation chemicals 
in april we acquired certain assets of reilly industries  inc s reilly carbon materials business 
the purchased assets consist primarily of inventories  customer sales contracts  raw material supply contracts  rail car leases  pitch melting assets and a non compete agreement 
we have integrated the additional tar distillation production into our existing facilities in the us outlook trend overview our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which could be negatively impacted by the relative increase in the value of coal tar as a fuel source as a result of higher energy prices  ii competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  and iii low margins in the utility pole business 
raw material prices have increased over the past several years  including our primary feedstocks coal tar  coal and lumber 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs  such as those occurring during and  have resulted in margin dilution because only the increased cost is passed on to the customer 
we believe that the global restructuring of the cm c business has stabilized with respect to the north american and european markets  and that future expansion of the aluminum and carbon pitch markets will be primarily in asian and middle eastern countries 
we expect to expand into these markets to the extent that the economics justify such expansion 
utility pole markets are expected to continue to remain competitive with resulting low margins  we will continue to review underperforming assets and rationalize capacity as necessary to remain competitive in this market and to reduce market share if warranted 
conditions in the us economy may have an impact on the demand for certain products  particularly coal tar chemicals  which are used in various applications related to consumer products and the housing industry 
net sales over the past several years have been significantly impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates in australia  denmark  china and the united kingdom 
in the event this trend reverses  net sales could decline if volumes do not increase 
seasonality and effects of weather on operations our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have been halted for short periods of time during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that it may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results can be significantly lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
we expect this seasonality trend to continue in future periods 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  and december  consolidated results net sales for the years ended december  and are summarized by segment in the following table year ended december  net change dollars in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products cm c net sales increased by million or percent due to the following changes in volume  pricing and foreign exchange price volume foreign exchange net change carbon materials a distillates b coal tar chemicals c other d total cm c a includes carbon pitch and refined tar 
b includes creosote and carbon black feedstock 
c includes naphthalene and phthalic anhydride 
d includes carbon black  furnace coke  benzole  freight and other products 
carbon materials prices increased in the us  europe and australasia as customer prices have been renegotiated in response to substantially higher raw material costs 
the increase in carbon materials sales volume is due partially to the acquisition of certain imported carbon pitch supply contracts from reilly industries inc reilly acquisition in april in addition to acquired domestic sales contracts related to the reilly acquisition 
these acquired import and domestic contracts resulted in a total sales volume increase for the year ended december  of four percent 
koppers holdings inc annual report overall  distillate pricing was flat for the year ended december  as increases in creosote prices in the us were largely responsible for the total price increase of one percent 
the increase in distillate sales volume is due primarily to higher european carbon black feedstock sales and higher us creosote sales of two percent in total 
for coal tar chemicals  increases in worldwide naphthalene prices and us phthalic anhydride prices resulted in a sales increase totaling one percent 
volume increases from naphthalene sales contributed to an increase of two percent 
with respect to other products  furnace coke realized higher pricing totaling one percent as compared to the prior year 
changes in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and australian and european currencies resulted in higher sales of five percent across all product lines 
r up net sales increased by million or percent due to the following changes in volume and pricing price volume foreign exchange net change railroad crossties a tso crossties b distribution poles other c total r up a includes treated and untreated railroad crossties 
b includes sales from treatment services only tso 
c includes transmission poles  pilings  creosote  freight and other treated and untreated lumber products 
sales price increases of treated railroad crossties totaled two percent for the year ended december  volume increases in treated railroad crossties of one percent were offset by volume decreases in untreated railroad crossties of the same percentage 
the price increase in other products is due primarily to higher creosote prices totaling four percent 
higher raw material costs contributed to the pricing increases realized in treated railroad crossties and creosote 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the year ended december  overall  cost of sales increased by million when compared to the prior year period due primarily to higher raw material volumes from the reilly acquisition  higher raw material costs and foreign exchange 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million lower when compared to the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to due diligence costs of million related to a potential acquisition which was not consummated 
other increases related to management incentive programs  stock based compensation programs  and investment in sales and administrative functions in china 
partially offsetting this increase was a one time expense totaling million for the termination of the saratoga partners iii  lp saratoga advisory services contract recognized in the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  was million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to costs incurred in the year ended december  related to our initial public offering 
the proceeds from the offering were used to redeem million of the percent senior secured notes due the senior secured notes which resulted in expenses totaling million for call premiums  bond consent fees and the write off of deferred financing costs 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the increase in pretax income of million 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was percent as compared to the prior year period of percent 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the smaller impact in proportion to pretax book income from the non conventional fuel tax credit in the current year period 
this effect was partially offset by a favorable impact from the mix of earnings between the us and australia and the ability to claim the domestic production activities deduction in the current year period 
gain on sale of koppers arch for the year ended december  represents the gain  net of tax expense  from the sale of our percent interest in koppers arch to arch chemicals on july  effective as of this date  koppers arch was classified as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations

these increases were partially offset by lower carbon pitch volumes of million and lower naphthalene volumes of million 
the price increase for carbon pitch was due primarily to higher raw material costs  and the phthalic anhydride and carbon black feedstock prices were favorably impacted by higher oil prices 
the price increase for phthalic anhydride was due primarily to higher costs for orthoxylene  which is a petroleum based feedstock used by all domestic competitors  but which is supplemented in our domestic operations by the use of internally produced naphthalene 
additionally  the impact of foreign exchange rates increased sales by million  freight costs in the us increased by million due primarily to the force majeure declaration in  and the increase in sales from a full year of the lambson acquisition amounted to million 
lambson speciality chemicals limited was acquired in the second quarter of net sales for r up increased four percent due primarily to increases in volumes and prices for railroad crossties of million and million  respectively 
additionally  volumes and prices for crosstie treating services experienced an increase of million and million  respectively 
lower volumes for utility distribution poles of million were largely offset by increased prices of million 
the increase in prices for railroad crossties was due primarily to higher raw material prices  the increase in volumes for crossties and crosstie treating services was due to the exit from the business of a major competitor  and the reduction in volumes for utility poles was the result of targeting higher margin business 
operating profit for cm c increased primarily due to higher sales and synergies derived from the reilly acquisition as operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased by percent 
operating profit for r up decreased primarily due to its share of the saratoga advisory services contract buyout expense of million in addition to the loss on the sale of our specialty trackwork business and other plant closure costs totaling million in depreciation and amortization for increased compared to the prior year due primarily to additional amortization as a result of the reilly acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million as compared to the prior period primarily due to million for the buyout of the saratoga advisory services contract and million of additional charges related to a pension curtailment and a deferred compensation plan in interest expense increased million due primarily to million of call premiums  write off of deferred financing costs and consent fees related to our initial public offering in february  which more than offset a reduction in interest expense related to the repayment of million of the senior secured notes from the proceeds of the initial public offering 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the tax benefit of non conventional fuel tax credits recorded in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was percent as compared to the prior year effective income tax rate of percent 
our effective income tax rate decreased due primarily to the effect of a benefit recorded for non conventional fuel tax credits in the current year period and a non deductible penalty in new zealand in the prior year period  which was partially offset by greater tax expense in china caused by a partial phase out of a tax holiday there in the current year period and greater us tax expense on a larger amount of repatriated earnings in the current year period 
carbon materials chemicals geographic review year ended december  net change dollars in millions net sales north america australasia including china europe operating profit north america australasia including china europe koppers holdings inc annual report north american cm c sales increased by percent due primarily to million of sales from the reilly acquisition  million of higher freight costs  and price increases driven primarily by higher raw material costs of million for carbon pitch and phthalic anhydride  partially offset by volume reductions of million for carbon pitch  refined tar  naphthalene  and roofing products

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  increased as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of term loans used to finance the reilly acquisition 
dividends paid were million in the year ended december  as compared to dividends paid of million for the year ended december  dividends paid in the year ended december  reflect a quarterly dividend rate of cents per common share 
dividends paid in the year ended december  include a special dividend declared prior to our initial public offering of cents per common share 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of cents per common share  payable on april  to shareholders of record as of february  liquidity and capital resources initial public offering we completed an initial public offering on february   resulting in the issuance of  additional common shares at a price of per share 
prior to the initial public offering   shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
of such converted shares   shares were sold by saratoga in connection with the initial public offering and the related over allotment option 
we received approximately million of net proceeds after million of expenses from the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock  which proceeds were principally used to redeem million principal amount of the koppers inc senior secured notes 
restrictions on dividends to koppers holdings koppers holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of koppers inc and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations  including payments of principal  interest and other amounts on the percent senior discount notes due the senior discount notes 
the terms of koppers inc s senior secured credit facility as well as the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes significantly restrict koppers inc from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to koppers holdings 
the amount of permitted dividends under both debt facilities is governed by a formula based on percent of consolidated net income  among other things 
cash equity contributions from the sale of koppers holdings common stock increase the amount available for dividends 
at the time of the payment of the dividend  no event of default shall have occurred or be continuing under the indenture or the senior secured credit facility 
under the indenture relating to the senior secured notes  koppers inc must have an ebitda as defined in the indenture to consolidated interest expense ratio of at least to additionally  the senior secured credit facility requires compliance with all financial covenants and availability of at least million under the revolving credit facility after giving effect to any proposed dividend 
significant reductions in net income  or increases to indebtedness affecting compliance with financial covenants or availability under the senior secured credit facility would restrict koppers inc s ability to pay dividends 
as of december   dividends available to be declared based on covenant restrictions under the senior discount notes amounted to million 
as of december   dividends available to be declared based on covenant restrictions under the senior secured notes amounted to million 
liquidity the koppers inc senior secured credit facility agreement  as amended  provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million and term loans of million at variable rates 
the senior secured credit facility expires in december amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of koppers inc s assets  including the assets of certain significant subsidiaries 
revolving credit availability is calculated based on receivables and inventory as well as the attainment of certain financial ratios 
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that limit capital expenditures by koppers inc and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  enter into leases  pay dividends and make investments or acquisitions 
in addition  such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by koppers inc to meet certain financial ratios 
as of december   we had million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments 
as of december   million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  as of december   we had outstanding term loans of million under the credit facility 
the following table summarizes koppers estimated liquidity as of december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents amount available under senior secured credit facility amount available under other credit facilities total estimated liquidity koppers holdings inc annual report our estimated liquidity was million at december  the increase in estimated liquidity from that date is due primarily to an increase in availability under our senior secured credit facility 
as of december   we had million aggregate amount of common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants or a combination of these securities available to be issued under our registration statement on form s filed in on february   our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program 
this program allows for the repurchase of up to million of common stock from time to time in the open market 
the program is scheduled to expire in february the timing of such purchases will be determined by us based on a number of factors including the market price of our common stock  the availability and pursuit of strategic initiatives including investment and acquisition opportunities  operating cash flow and internal capital requirements  and general economic conditions 
our need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service  purchase commitments and operating leases  as well as for working capital  capital maintenance programs and mandatory defined benefit plan funding 
we may also use cash to pursue potential strategic acquisitions 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that the foregoing sources are not sufficient to fund our expenditures and service our indebtedness  we would be required to raise additional funds 
cash flows from discontinued operations the cash flows related to koppers arch for the three years ended december  have not been restated in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
excluding cash proceeds from the sale of koppers arch  net cash outflows of koppers arch totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in connection with the sale of our percent interest in koppers arch  we have provided an indemnity to the buyer for our share of liabilities  if any  arising from certain litigation and claims existing at july  our financial exposure pursuant to this indemnity is capped at a monetary limit and is subject to time limitations 
schedule of certain contractual obligations the following table details our projected payments for our significant contractual obligations as of december  the table is based upon available information and certain assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt including swap and accretion interest on debt operating leases tkk joint venture capital contribution purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations consists primarily of raw materials purchase contracts 
these are typically not fixed price arrangements  the prices are based on the prevailing market prices 
as a result  we generally expect to be able to hedge the purchases with sales at those future prices 
pension and other employee benefit plan funding obligations for defined benefit plans are not included in the table above 
we expect defined benefit plan contributions to total million in estimated funding obligations are determined by asset performance  workforce and retiree demographics  tax and employment laws and other actuarial assumptions which may change the annual funding obligations 
the funded status of our defined benefit plans is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in  we expect to retire from service one of our owned vessels used to transport carbon material products and raw materials 
in connection with this retirement  we may be liable to fund severance benefits for certain members of the vessel s crew  who are not our employees  under a contractual arrangement with the vessel s operator 
there are a number of uncertainties regarding our obligation to fund such benefits and the extent of the liability  if any  under the contractual arrangement 
in connection with the owned vessel s retirement  we expect to enter into a time charter in to lease a replacement vessel for a term of up to seven years including renewal periods 
the incremental contractual obligation with respect to the replacement vessel is approximately million per year 
schedule of certain other commercial commitments the following table details our projected payments for other significant commercial commitments as of december  the table is based upon available information and certain assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in millions lines of credit unused standby letters of credit total other commercial commitments debt covenants the covenants that affect availability of the revolving credit facility and which may restrict the ability of koppers inc to pay dividends include the following financial ratios the fixed charge coverage ratio  calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  shall not be less than to the fixed charge coverage ratio at december  was to the total leverage ratio  calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  shall not exceed the ratios set forth below for the periods as specified in the table below 
the total leverage ratio at december  was to fiscal quarters ended ratio august  through june  to june  and thereafter to we are currently in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement governing the senior secured revolving credit facility 
at december   koppers inc had million outstanding of senior secured notes excluding adjustment for related interest rate swap and koppers holdings had million outstanding of senior discount notes 
the senior secured notes and senior discount notes include customary covenants that restrict  among other things  the ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  incur liens  merge or sell all or substantially all of the assets or enter into various transactions with affiliates 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants in the indentures governing the senior secured notes and the senior discount notes 
other matters non conventional fuel tax credits we earn non conventional fuel tax credits as a result of the production and sale of coke and coke gas at our facility in monessen  pennsylvania 
until december  federal tax law contained a phase out provision that reduced or eliminated the non conventional fuel tax credit if the reference price of oil was within or exceeded a phase out range 
the application of the phase out provision  however  was revised to no longer apply to facilities producing coke or coke gas otherwise eligible for the credit by the tax relief and health care act of  which was passed by congress and signed into law by the president in december the recognition of non conventional fuel tax credits reduced our income tax expense by million in and million in koppers holdings inc annual report under current tax law  the non conventional fuel tax credit is now part of the general business credit 
as such  to the extent the credits are not used in the tax year they are generated  the credits may be carried back one year and carried forward years 
the non conventional fuel tax credit provisions of the internal revenue code applicable to products produced at our coke facility expire at the end of interest rate swap in january  koppers inc entered into an interest rate swap agreement for million of the senior secured notes in order to protect a portion of the debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the agreement is designed to receive fixed percent and pay floating six month libor rates plus a spread of percent with semiannual settlements through october changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are expected to offset changes in the fair value of the senior secured notes 
the impact on the years ended december   and was to increase decrease interest expense by million  million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the swap agreement at december  was a liability of approximately million 
foreign operations and foreign currency transactions we are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations due to our foreign operations 
for the years ended december   and  exchange rate fluctuations resulted in an increase decrease to comprehensive income of million  million and million  respectively 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency which is different from the currency used by the entity to prepare its financial statements 
foreign currency transaction gains losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
recently issued accounting guidance the information related to recently issued accounting guidance set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements is hereby incorporated by reference 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
our management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or when title passes to the customer 
we recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon transfer of title  which occurs upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer 
service revenue  consisting primarily of wood treating services  is recognized at the time the service is provided 
our recognition of revenue with respect to untreated crossties meets all the recognition criteria of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin topic a  including transfer of title and risk of ownership  the existence of fixed purchase commitments and delivery schedules established by the customer and the completion of all performance obligations by us 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
in the united states  cm c excluding furnace coke and r up inventories are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
inventories outside the united states are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the first in  first out basis fifo  or market 
market represents replacement cost for raw materials and net realizable value for work in process and finished goods 
lifo inventories constituted approximately percent of the fifo inventory value at december  and long lived assets 
our management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  based on a number of factors including operating results  projected future cash flows and business plans 
we record long lived assets at the lower of cost or fair value  with fair value based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of fixed assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
in making this assessment  management relies on various factors  including operating results  estimated future cash flows  and business plans 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
because management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated 
goodwill valuations are performed using an average of actual and projected operating results of the relevant reporting units 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
additionally  disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
at december  our balance sheet included million of deferred tax assets 
we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required for these deferred tax assets  based on future earnings projections 
to the extent that we encounter unexpected difficulties in market conditions  adverse changes in regulations affecting our businesses and operations  adverse outcomes in legal and environmental matters  or any other unfavorable conditions  the projections for future taxable income may be overstated and we may be required to record an increase in the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on income in the future

we are insured for property  casualty and workers compensation insurance up to various stop loss amounts after meeting required retention levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the liability for the related retentions for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience 
in the event we incur a significant number of losses beyond the coverage retention limits  additional expense beyond the actuarial projections would be required 
asset retirement obligations 
we measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance  using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks 
in the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates  we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues 
pension and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided far into the future and allocating that cost over the time period each employee works 
this calculation requires extensive use of assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns  mortality  medical costs  employee turnover and discount rates 
in determining the expected return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate long term actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and estimates of future investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  we take into consideration a number of factors including our actual health care cost increases  the design of our benefit programs  the characteristics of our active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates 
because these items require our management s judgment  the related liabilities currently recorded by us could be lower or higher than amounts ultimately required to be paid 
litigation contingencies 
we record liabilities related to legal matters when an adverse outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent we anticipate favorable outcomes to these matters which ultimately result in adverse outcomes  we could incur material adverse impacts on earnings and cash flows 
because such matters require significant judgments on the part of management  the recorded liabilities could be lower than what is ultimately required 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including  among other things  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  the discharge of effluent into waterways  the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters 
we expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third party claims  or otherwise incur costs  koppers holdings inc annual report relating to cleanup of  or for injuries resulting from  contamination at sites associated with past and present operations 
we accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage the interest rate risks  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
this reduces the impact of short term fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  we enter into foreign currency debt instruments that are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating currencies on net income and equity 
we also use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments up to twelve months and all such contracts are marked to market with the recognition of a gain or loss at each reporting period 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our financial instruments and foreign operations to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  and the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
these forward looking statements are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments and foreign operations 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have both fixed and variable rate debt to manage interest rate risk and to minimize borrowing costs 
in january  we also entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with respect to notional million of the senior secured notes 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million at december  at december  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt  and at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt for both years  including the swap 
our ratio of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at december   including the interest rate swap referred to above  was approximately percent  reflecting a decrease in the ratio from percent in the previous period due to the decrease in variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels and foreign exchange rates  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  and would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the earnings and cash flows for the next year assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease approximately million  holding other variables constant 
with respect to the interest rate swap  a ten percent decrease in interest rates at december  would have decreased the unrealized fair market value of the interest rate swap by approximately million to an asset of million 
a ten percent increase in interest rates at december  would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the interest rate swap by approximately million to a liability of million 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis 
our exchange rate exposures result primarily from our investment and ongoing operations in australia  denmark and the united kingdom 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent reduction in all relevant exchange rates  the effect on our earnings  based on actual earnings from foreign operations for the years ended december  and  would be reductions of approximately million and million  respectively
