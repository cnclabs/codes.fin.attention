item a 
risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
those risk factors are outlined below 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in certain of the product lines and markets in which we compete 
we expect that our competitors will develop and introduce new and enhanced products  which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of certain products we manufacture 
in addition  as a result of price 
table of contents competition  we may be compelled to reduce the prices for some of our products  which could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers 
our inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater financial  technological  and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility than we are able to maintain 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices for raw materials  and changes in general economic conditions 
sudden or sharp raw materials price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  maleic anhydride  olefin copolymers  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest  or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products 
availability of raw materials and transportation systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the chemical industry is experiencing some tightness of supply of certain materials and the transportation industry is in a situation where supply and demand are in balance 
any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials or transportation systems 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our principal customers are major multinational oil companies 
the oil industry is characterized by concentration of a few large participants as a result of consolidation 
the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in purchases by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our customers are concentrated in the lubricant and fuel industries and  as a result  our reliance on that industry is significant 
most of our customers are primarily engaged in the fuel and lubricant industries 
this concentration of customers affects our overall risk profile  since our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic  geopolitical  and industry conditions 
many factors affect the level of our customers spending on our products  including  among others  general business conditions  changes in technology  interest rates  gasoline prices  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
a sudden or protracted downturn in these industries could adversely affect the buying power and purchases by our customers 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
our future business success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our 
table of contents industry is characterized by frequent changes in industry performance standards  which affect the amount and timing of our research and development costs and other technology related costs 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is often hard to predict 
further  technological changes in some or all of our customers products or processes may make our products obsolete 
any inability to anticipate  respond to  or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow in any given period 
we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in completing acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition  or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of the products we sell are produced only in one location 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of those production facilities 
those production facilities are subject to various hazards associated with the manufacture  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unscheduled downtime  and environmental hazards 
some of our products involve the manufacture and handling of a variety of reactive  explosive  and flammable materials 
many of these hazards could cause a disruption in the production of our products 
we cannot assure you that these facilities will not experience these types of hazards and disruptions in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in any given period 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
in  net sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately of total net sales 
we do business in all major regions of the world  some of which do not have stable economies or governments 
in particular  we sell and market products in countries experiencing political and economic instability in the middle east  asia pacific  and latin america 
our international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  increases in royalties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  taxes  government royalties  inflationary economies and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies such as restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these factors may increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we conduct our business in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the 
table of contents relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements  as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  compounds  and other technologies is important to our business 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark  and copyright law  as well as judicial enforcement  to protect such technologies 
we currently own approximately  issued us and foreign patents  with a significant number of additional patents pending 
some of these patents are licensed to others 
in addition  we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses or otherwise 
we have developed and may in the future develop technologies with universities or other academic institutions  or with the use of government funding 
in such cases  the academic institution or the government may retain certain rights to the developed intellectual property 
we also own approximately trademark and service mark registrations throughout the world for our marks  including afton chemical  ethyl  hitec  tecgard  greenburn and mmt  as well as pending trademark and service mark applications  including biotec  axcel  and newmarket sm 
in the event that we are unable to continue using certain of our marks  we may be forced to rebrand our products  which could result in the loss of brand recognition  and could require us to devote resources to advertise and market brands 
in particular  the loss of our hitec mark would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that the measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
the failure of our patents or other measures to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

table of contents our business is subject to government regulation  and could be adversely affected by future governmental regulation 
we are subject to regulation by local  state  federal  and foreign governmental authorities 
in some circumstances  before we may sell certain products  these authorities must approve these products  our manufacturing processes  and facilities 
we are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products  manufacturing processes  and facilities by governmental authorities 
in order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products  we must  among other things  demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations 
the process of seeking approvals can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated and significant delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis  or at all 
any delay in obtaining  or any failure to obtain or maintain  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate net sales from those products 
new laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscation  recall  or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution  and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls or seizures  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our business and our customers are subject to significant new regulations under the european commission s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulation 
reach became effective on june  it imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports  including testing data  on each chemical substance  perform chemical safety assessments  and obtain pre market authorization with respect to certain substances of particularly high concern 
the new regulation imposes significant additional burdens on chemical producers and importers  and  to a lesser extent  downstream users of chemical substances and preparations 
our manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will likely require us to incur significant additional compliance costs 
political  economic  and regulatory factors concerning one of our products  mmt  could adversely affect our sales of mmt 
the epa studied mmt and determined that it does not cause or contribute to the failure of vehicle emission systems 
the canadian government has made similar findings 
however  the epa is requiring additional testing to fill some data gaps  including potential risks to public health  and a change in current determinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  certain industry groups are urging greater regulation of all metal based gasoline additives  including mmt 
in  the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam issued a fleet test report on mmt based on tests conducted by the aam  the association of international automobile manufacturers  and the canadian vehicle manufacturers association 
the report alleges that mmt significantly raises vehicle emissions  increases fuel emissions  increases fuel consumption  and impairs the proper operation of vehicle emission control systems 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt on vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review 
substantially all of our customers in canada have suspended the use of mmt  pending the results of the government of canada sponsored independent third party review 
to date  the government of canada has not initiated the review 
we expect that the european union will also review all metal based petroleum additives  including mmt  for their impact on pollution abatement technology 
increased government regulation of mmt if it occurs or additional studies evaluating mmt  even if government regulation does not occur  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of that product 

table of contents legal proceedings and other claims could impose substantial costs on us 
we are involved in numerous administrative and legal proceedings that result from  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
from time to time  these proceedings involve environmental  product liability  tel  premises asbestos liability  and other matters 
see item  legal proceedings 
we have insurance coverage that we believe would be available to mitigate potential damages in many of these proceedings 
however  there is no assurance that our available insurance will cover these claims  that our insurers will not challenge coverage for certain claims  or that final damage awards will not exceed our available insurance coverage 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations 
as a manufacturer and distributor of chemical products  we are generally subject to extensive local  state  federal  and foreign environmental  safety  and health laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land and water  the generation  handling  treatment  and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials  and remediation of contaminated soil  surface  and ground water 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with laws  regulations  statutes  and ordinances protecting the environment  including those related to the discharge of materials 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and the enforcement or interpretation of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
although we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements  the costs could be material 
non compliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines  damages arising from third party lawsuits  or the suspension and potential cessation of non compliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  and personal injury 
we cannot assure you that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  on site facilities or underground tanks for the storage of chemicals  hazardous materials  and waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or contamination of the environment 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury  product liability  property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances  such as premises asbestos  at or from our facilities 
we may also face liability for personal injury  product liability  property damage  natural resource damage  or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contaminants or hazardous substances from our facilities or for future accidents or spills 
a significant increase in the number or success of these claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
for further discussion of some related claims  see item  business environmental 

table of contents the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
a liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  whether currently or formerly owned or operated regardless of fault  knowledge  timing of the contamination  cause of the contamination  percentage of contribution to the contamination  or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including clean up costs  natural resource damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions  and third party claims  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a prp in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp 
as a prp  we may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up hazardous waste sites  such as a landfill to which we may have sent waste 
in de minimis prp matters and in some minor prp matters  we generally negotiate a consent decree to pay an apportioned settlement 
this relieves us of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
settlement costs for a de minimis participant are less than  settlement costs for a minor participant are less than we are also a prp at superfund sites where our liability may be in excess of de minimis or minor prp levels 
most superfund sites where we are a prp represent environmental issues that are quite mature 
the sites have been investigated  and in many cases  the remediation methodology  as well as the proportionate shares of each prp have been established 
other sites are not as mature  which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of future clean up or remediation costs 
generally  remediation and monitoring will go on for an extended period 
as a result  we may incur substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years  a portion of which may be covered by insurance 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which reduces your ability to gauge our performance 
external factors beyond our control  such as customer orders  product shipment dates  and other factors can cause shifts in net sales and income from quarter to quarter 
these external factors can magnify the impact of industry cycles 
as a result  our income and cash flow may fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis  and your ability to gauge trends in our business may be impaired 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement  senior notes  and construction loan contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production or our transportation systems and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling  and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment  and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of 
table of contents these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations  and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension funds  which may be underfunded due to any future underperformance of the equities markets 
our pension plan asset allocation is predominantly weighted towards equities 
cash contribution requirements to our pension plans are sensitive to changes in our plans actual return on assets 
reductions in our plans expected return on assets due to poor performance of the equities markets could cause our pension plans to be underfunded and require us to make additional cash contributions 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption  and casualty insurance  but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including natural disasters and domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
federal legislation is under consideration that could impose significant new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities that may increase our overhead expenses 
federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive 
development and construction risks associated with foundry park i could adversely affect our financial results 
we own approximately acres of real property available for development in downtown richmond  virginia adjacent to our principal executive offices and are considering development alternatives for this real estate 
in january  foundry park i entered into a deed of lease agreement with meadwestvaco under which meadwestvaco will lease an office building that is being constructed on approximately three acres of this real property 
our development and construction activities may subject us to the following risks we may be unable to obtain  or suffer delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  we may incur development and construction costs that exceed our original estimates  we may be unable to complete a project on schedule  which could result in increased construction costs and penalties  and we may be unable to obtain the permanent financing on favorable terms

operating rates of the plants vary with product mix and normal sales swings 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
item legal proceedings we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund 
some of these legal proceedings relate to environmental matters and involve governmental authorities 
for further information see environmental in part i  item while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  we believe the outcome of any of these proceedings  or all of them combined  will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
asbestos like many other companies  we are also a defendant in personal injury lawsuits involving exposure to asbestos 
these cases involve exposure to asbestos in premises owned or operated  or formerly owned or operated  by subsidiaries of newmarket 
we have never manufactured  sold  or distributed products that contain 
table of contents asbestos 
nearly all of these cases are pending in texas  louisiana  or illinois and involve multiple defendants 
we maintain an accrual for these proceedings  as well as a receivable for expected insurance recoveries 
during  we entered into an agreement with travelers indemnity company travelers resolving certain long standing issues regarding our coverage for certain premises asbestos claims 
in addition  our agreement with travelers provides a procedure for allocating defense and indemnity costs with respect to certain future premises asbestos claims 
the lawsuit we had previously filed against travelers in the southern district of texas was dismissed 
we also settled our outstanding receivable from albemarle corporation albemarle for certain premises asbestos liability obligations 
the accrual for our premises asbestos liability related to currently asserted claims is based on the following assumptions and factors we are often one of many defendants 
this factor influences both the number of claims settled against us and also the indemnity cost associated with such resolutions 
the estimated percent of claimants in each case that will actually  after discovery  make a claim against us  out of the total number of claimants in a case  is based on a level consistent with past experience and current trends 
we utilize average comparable plaintiff cost history as the basis for estimating pending premises asbestos related claims 
these claims are filed by both former contractors employees  and former employees who worked at past and present company locations 
we also include an estimated inflation factor in the calculation 
no estimate is made for unasserted claims 
the estimated recoveries from insurance and albemarle for these cases are based on  and are consistent with  the settlement agreements 
based on the above assumptions  we have provided an undiscounted liability related to premises asbestos claims of million at year end and million at year end the liabilities related to asbestos claims are included in accrued expenses current portion and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet 
certain of these costs are recovered through our insurance coverage and agreement with albemarle 
the receivable for these recoveries related to premises asbestos liabilities was million at both december  and december  these receivables are included in trade and other accounts receivable for the current portion

overview the year was an outstanding one for our business 
we experienced excellent results which have strengthened our financial position 
our balance sheet remains strong at december  with approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
there are many factors which account for the excellent performance in the petroleum additives segment in we continue to support our customers with increasing levels of spending in research and development 
this investment has allowed us to develop new technologies and a high level of technical support to our customers and to global oems 
we launched many new products in these products were focused on the areas that are important to our customers  such as  increasing fuel economy  durability of hardware  reduction in warranty claims  and cleaner combustion systems 
we also introduced new cost effective engine oil formulations that provide both robust field performance and the ability to utilize these formulations to achieve multiple desired product specifications  thus simplifying product supply 
our ability to price our products for their value has facilitated the recovery of raw material increases experienced in both and 
table of contents our supply chain system ran well last year  providing uninterrupted services to our customers despite high production levels at our plants and numerous new product introductions 
our marketing efforts  including licensing and co branding  have helped to build upon our already good relationships with several of our key customers 
during the second quarter  we resolved all of the arbitration actions between ethyl and innospec and terminated the tel marketing agreements with innospec effective april  we received million during the second quarter as compensation for this termination 
we recognized a gain of million before tax on the settlement of the arbitration actions and termination of this business and have reflected the gain  as well as the income from operations of this business  as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
ethyl continues to purchase tel from innospec under a separate agreement for sales to customers in north america 
however  after the termination of the tel marketing agreements  we determined the continuing operations of the tel business no longer represented a significant segment 
as a result  we have reclassified the continuing operations of the tel business in an all other category for segment reporting for all periods presented 
also included in the all other category is contract manufacturing ethyl provides to afton and to third parties 
results of operations net sales net sales in increased over the past two years in essentially all areas of the petroleum additives segment

the increase in operating profit reflects the increase of in net sales when comparing to  as well as a favorable mix of products sold and a favorable foreign currency impact 
total shipments were essentially unchanged between the two years on a unit basis 
we experienced the benefit of a full year of price increases achieved throughout  as our pricing caught up to the rapid rise in raw materials that we experienced last year 
we benefited from improved margins on certain products through the introduction of more cost effective product formulations for our customers and a better mix of sales of higher margin products 
petroleum additives operating profit for increased million  or  when compared to the level of million 
operating profit for included a gain of million associated with a legal settlement 
table of contents related to transportation charges  as well as a gain of million resulting from a class action lawsuit related to raw materials and a loss of million from other legal settlements 
the increase in operating profit was in both lubricant and fuel additives reflecting improved net sales and profit margins 
net sales were approximately higher than reflecting improved pricing and improvements in product mix 
while raw material costs escalated in  we were able to implement certain price increases 
these price increases enabled us to restore our margins that have been under pressure since the significant increase in raw material costs began in our production facilities operated at high rates in and we sold more efficient product formulations  lowering both our cost and our customers costs 
the results also included a small  unfavorable foreign currency impact 
total r d for this segment was million in  million in  and million in the increase in r d between and was across all product lines 
the increase in r d when comparing and is also across all product lines  but mainly in the engine oil additives product line 
while our r d costs are rising  the projects and product lines that are researched can be quite different from year to year 
this is normal for our business and is a function of industry specifications  customers expectations  and competitive forces 
r d related to new products and processes was million in  million in  and million in all of our r d expenses were related to the petroleum additives segment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a in for this segment were substantially unchanged from levels  while was approximately million higher than the increase in from levels primarily resulted from higher professional fees and personnel related expenses 
as a percentage of net segment sales  sg a combined with r d expenses were in  in  and in the improvement in the percentages when comparing each of the years reflects larger increases in net sales as compared to the smaller increases in sg a and r d

no principal reduction payment is due during the construction period 
as a condition of the construction loan and concurrently with the closing of the loan  foundry park i also obtained interest rate risk protection in the form of an interest rate swap swap

we utilize the optional combined mortality tables for males and females based on the rp mortality tables projected with scale aa as published by the irs on february  in determining the impact of the us benefit plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions under sfas and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on pension plan assets 
as part of the review and to develop expected rates of return  we considered a stochastic analysis of expected returns based on the us plans asset allocation as of both january  and january  this forecast reflects our expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
as of january   the expected rates were for us large cap stocks  for us long term corporate bonds  and for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
our asset allocation is predominantly weighted toward equities 
through a review of our investments we have determined that we should maintain the expected long term rate of return for our us plans at at december  an actuarial loss  where the expected return exceeds the actual return  occurred during resulting in the actual investment return being approximately thousand lower than the expected return for all of our us pension plans 
an actuarial gain  where the actual return exceeds the expected return  occurred during resulting in the actual investment return exceeding the assumed return in by approximately million for all of our us pension plans 
an actuarial loss also occurred during resulting in the one year investment return being lower than the long term assumption by approximately million for all of our us pension plans 
investment gains and losses enter earnings on an amortized basis so that the recent years results caused a decrease in expense of approximately thousand in  as well as an expected thousand decrease in expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for equity investments 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase 
table of contents the forecasted expense for our us pension plans by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption under sfas and sfas we utilize the citigroup pension discount curve discount curve and liability index in developing the discount rate assumption 
we apply the expected cash flows of the specific defined benefit retirement plan to the interest rates provided in the discount curve 
the rate is developed based on the discount curve on the last day of december 
the discount rate at december  was 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have increased our rate of projected compensation increase at december  to 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate cash contributions  before income taxes  to the us pension plans will be approximately million in other assumptions under sfas during  we reviewed our assumption for the health care cost trend rate under sfas based on actual cost experience  we revised the healthcare cost trend rate upwards 
consequently  we increased our assumption for the health care cost trend rate to in scaling down to by the health care cost trend rate was at december  at december  and after a review of market conditions  we decreased our expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans by basis points to 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
foreign pension benefit plans as discussed above  our foreign pension plans are quite diverse 
the following information applies only to our uk pension plan  which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from our foreign pension plans 
the average remaining service period for our uk plan is years  while the average remaining life expectancy is years 
we utilize pa mortality tables which allow for future medium cohort projected improvements in life expectancy  in determining the impact of the uk pension plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions under sfas and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on the uk pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return is based on both the asset allocation  as well as yields available in the uk markets 

table of contents the target asset allocation in the uk is to be invested in equities and in a mixture of government and corporate bonds 
based on the target asset allocation and the expect yields available in the uk markets  the expected long term rate of return for the uk pension plan is at december  an actuarial loss occurred during as the expected investment return exceeded the actual return in by approximately thousand for our uk pension plan 
this compares to an actuarial gain of thousand in and million in investment gains and losses enter earnings on an amortized basis resulting in increased expense of approximately million in  as well as an expected million increased expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for the target asset allocation 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plan by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption under sfas we utilize a yield curve based on aa rated corporate bond yields provided by lehman in developing a discount rate assumption extrapolated at terms above years based on government bond yields and the spread between these and corporate bond yields 
the yield appropriate to the duration of the uk plan liabilities is then used 
the discount rate at december  was 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have increased our rate of projected compensation increase at december  to 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the uk pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate uk cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in outlook the year was an outstanding one for our business  which has strengthened our financial position 
as we have communicated in the past  we intend to leverage our financial strength to increase shareholder value by growing the business  with acquisitions being an area of primary interest 
our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry 
it is our view that this industry will provide the greatest opportunity for a good return on our investment while minimizing risk 
in the past  we have grown the business through strategic acquisitions such as amoco petroleum additives company and texaco additives company 
we remain focused on this strategy and will evaluate any future opportunities 
nonetheless  we are patient in this pursuit and intend to make the right acquisition for our company when the opportunity arises 

table of contents meanwhile  we believe we have many internal opportunities for growth in the near term  from both geographical and product line extensions 
until an acquisition materializes  we will build cash on our balance sheet and will continue to evaluate all alternative uses for that cash to enhance shareholder value  including stock repurchases and dividends 
in  we announced our intention to develop some of the downtown richmond property that we own by constructing a multi story office building for meadwestvaco 
the project is progressing on schedule 
our development and construction team is in place  and our financing has been secured 
our construction loan allows us to borrow up to million of the project cost 
we will be capitalizing the cost and interest throughout the building project 
total expenditures on this project for are projected to be approximately million 
we anticipate the project will be completed by the end of  at which time we expect this business to begin to be accretive to our earnings 
in the petroleum additives segment  we are beginning with good momentum and expect to be able to benefit from the many gains we made during we have a solid business base  a good technical product offering  and an excellent team who is dedicated to our customers and our business 
nonetheless  like many industries  the petroleum additives market continues to face many challenges 
raw material prices are once again rising and there is uncertainty in product demand should a recession in the united states  or other parts of our marketplace  become a reality 
we continue to monitor the raw material situation closely and are committed to attempting to recover any gross margin erosion caused by increasing raw material prices 
except for the possible impacts from an economic slowdown  we expect that the petroleum additives segment will perform better in than in critical accounting policies and estimates it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows  as well as our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the sec  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 
our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in reported financial results 
intangibles  net of amortization we have certain identifiable intangibles amounting to million at year end that are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and are being amortized over periods with up to approximately nine years of remaining life 
we continue to assess the market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the amortization periods and values are appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when significant events or circumstances occur that might impair the value of these assets 
these evaluations continue to support the value at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in this market  it could possibly cause a reduction in the periods of this amortization charge or result in a noncash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no effect on cash flows 
we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions 
environmental and legal proceedings we have made disclosure of our environmental matters in item of this annual report on form k  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate 
table of contents for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k  while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  it is our opinion  based on our current knowledge  that we will not experience any material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we use assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could result in different results for the plans 
we develop these assumptions after considering available information that we deem relevant 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item income taxes we file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns  as well as individual foreign income tax returns  under which assumptions may be made to determine the deductibility of certain costs 
we make estimates related to the impact of tax positions taken on our financial statements when we believe the tax position is likely to be upheld on audit 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in the determination of the estimated future recovery of deferred tax assets

additionally  costs incurred to effect the acquisition are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are evaluating any potential impact of the adoption of sfas r on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials and marketable security prices 
these risk factors may affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives 
as of december   based on our review  we had no contracts with material embedded derivatives 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at year end we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million 
of the total debt  million is at fixed rates 
there is no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the fixed rate debt 
the remaining amount of debt represents the outstanding balance of the construction loan 
during the third quarter  foundry park i entered into the construction loan to borrow up to million 
the loan bears interest at libor plus basis points 
if interest rates were to increase  we would incur additional interest costs 
as this loan is related to a capital project  all interest costs are being capitalized and will not have an impact on earnings until the completion of the project when the capitalized interest is amortized 
concurrently with entering into the construction loan  foundry park i entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of of the projected draws on the construction loan 
the fixed rate on the interest rate swap is  while the variable rate is based on libor 
as libor fluctuates and the notional amount of the interest rate swap increases  the settlement amount  or the difference between the fixed rate and libor  will also fluctuate 
the settlement amount is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will not have an impact on earnings until the completion of the project when the balance will be amortized into earnings over the depreciable life of the building 
if we were to borrow under our senior credit facility in the future  we would experience interest rate risk based on the interest rates available to us at that time 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value of our debt at year end 
table of contents foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into million of euro denominated forward contracts to minimize currency exposure from expected cash flows from foreign operations 
the contracts all had maturity dates in and at december   all of these contracts had matured 
during  we entered into million of euro denominated forward contracts to minimize currency exposure from expected cash flows from foreign operations 
the contracts have maturity dates in and at december   there were million remaining of these euro denominated contracts 
with other variables held constant  a hypothetical adverse change in the december  forward euro rates would have resulted in a decrease of about million in the value of the contracts 
raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  olefin copolymers  maleic anhydride  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand  or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit
