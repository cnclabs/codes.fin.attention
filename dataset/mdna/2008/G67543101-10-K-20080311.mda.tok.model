segment information appearing below in this discussion and analysis  and in note of our consolidated financial statements  is presented in accordance with sfas no  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  sfas 
overview of our business we are one of the world s leading providers of software solutions for the delivery of digital and interactive television 
our software enables cable  satellite  telecommunications  and digital terrestrial operators  which we refer to as network operators  to offer enhanced television experiences to their viewers 
the majority of our revenue typically comes from one time royalty fees paid by network operators or manufacturers of set top boxes  once a set top box  which incorporates our software  has been shipped to  or activated by  the network operator 
we also derive revenue from the licensing of related software and interactive content and applications associated with the delivery of digital and interactive television  as well as from licensing products that enable advanced advertising solutions 
in addition  we receive professional services fees from consulting  systems integration and training engagements  fees for the maintenance and support of our products and fees from revenue sharing arrangements related to the use of our interactive content and applications 
our revenue model may change over time 
for example  we have signed subscription based licensing agreements under which we receive monthly payments for each set top box that includes our software that our customers deploy  for so long as those set top boxes remain active 
in addition  we expect in the future to supplement this business model by licensing our technology and services indirectly through distribution arrangements with key partners other than network operators and set top box manufacturers  such as conditional access vendors 
kudelski sa  directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries  beneficially owns class a and class b ordinary shares of our company collectively representing an economic interest of approximately and a voting interest of approximately in our company  based on the number of our ordinary shares outstanding as of december  recent events in september  we signed a letter of intent to sell static holdings ltd  which operated our playjam games business 
the transaction closed on december  in accordance with sfas  the business unit has been reclassified as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been revised for all periods presented to reflect this business as a discontinued operation 
unless noted otherwise  discussions in this annual report on form k pertain only to continuing activities 
in february  we received million in cash from liberty 
this represents the remaining capital contribution due to us pursuant to an agreement we entered into with liberty in february  which provided for us to receive a portion of any premium received by liberty in any sale of its stake in opentv 
in the aggregate  we received million from liberty in connection with the january stock sale transaction between liberty and kudelski sa  which represents of the premium received by liberty in that transaction

bennett assumed this role after having served as acting chief executive officer and chief operating officer since august 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting polices and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  restructuring costs and share based compensation 
all of these accounting policies and estimates  together with their underlying assumptions  and their impact on our financial statements  have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap as has been prescribed for the software industry  the principal policies of which are reflected in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
the application of sop requires judgment about a number of matters  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements of the arrangement exists 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue to recognize currently and which portions to defer and recognize in later periods 
in some cases  we may  therefore  record the costs associated with a licensing transaction before we are able to recognize the revenue related to that license  even if we have actually invoiced the customer or received a cash payment from that customer 
in other cases  we may accumulate costs in the same manner as inventory costs  and charge those costs to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate valuation for those products and services 
our judgments and estimates regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
because the terms of our licensing arrangements may differ for various customers  including subscription based or one time royalty arrangements  we may apply different recognition policies to different customer contracts depending upon those particular terms 
for fixed bid contracts under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the actual results could differ from the percentage estimates by the time a project is complete 
the recognition of revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognized may have been different if other assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 

table of contents valuation allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance 
currently  we maintain a partial valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
adjustments may be required in the future if our estimate of the realizable amount of deferred tax assets changes 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  property and equipment  other assets and other intangible assets  which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and in the case of goodwill  at least annually 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the most significant assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is revenue 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments that can be significantly impacted by changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  competition and demographic trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
restructuring costs we continuously monitor our organizational structure and associated operating expenses 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken periodically to restructure the business 
restructuring activities may include terminating employees  abandoning excess office space and incurring other exit costs 
any resulting restructuring costs depend on numerous estimates made by us based on our knowledge of the activity being affected  the cost to exit existing commitments and fair value estimates 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
while we believe that these assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that actual experience may not differ materially from these assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and binomial lattice models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments 
table of contents in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire without any value having been realized by the employee  notwithstanding the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no widely accepted market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas r and sab no 
 interaction between fasb statement no 
r  and certain sec rules and regulations regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangement for public companies  sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may materially affect the fair value estimates of future share based payments  which may result in a lack of consistency 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report on form k for further information regarding the impact of sfas r on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the intent to mitigate volatility in financial reporting that can occur when related assets and liabilities are recorded on different bases 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we have prepared a report  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  which evaluates our internal control over financial reporting as of december  that complete report  as well as our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and our remediation efforts  if any  are included under item a of this annual report on form k  which investors should read in its entirety 

table of contents we are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
those controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
while those controls may be expected to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of our financial reporting  we do not expect that such controls will prevent all errors and fraud 
we monitor our controls and maintain those controls as dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 
as we assessed our internal control over financial reporting  we sought to identify various deficiencies or weaknesses that we may have and  if any were identified  to correct those deficiencies or weaknesses as promptly as practicable 
we are required to disclose any material weaknesses that we have identified 
the public company accounting oversight board  which was established under the sarbanes oxley act  defines a material weakness as a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
we also maintain a system of disclosure controls that have been designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the securities exchange act of  as amended  including this annual report on form k  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec 
as more fully described in item a of this annual report on form k  based on our assessment  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our system of disclosure controls were effective as of december  and  respectively 
years ended december   and revenues we have entered into commercial arrangements involving both product licenses and service elements that are bundled together 
revenues from such bundled offerings under gaap have been allocated to the royalties and licenses and services and other revenue line items based on the relative fair values of the product and service elements in each of the contracts 
our determination of the relative fair values of these elements is based on the relative amounts of the fees we charge our customers for the product licenses and service elements  as set forth in each of the applicable contracts 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in revenues by line item were as follows in millions  except percentages year ended december  change versus versus royalties and licenses services and other total revenues royalties and licenses we generally derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software 
royalties are paid by either the network operator or the set top box manufacturer depending upon our 
table of contents payment arrangements with those customers 
we recognize royalties upon receipt of royalty reports reflecting unit shipments or activation of our software by network operators or manufacturers 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenues upon initial delivery of the software to our customers 
we have historically realized revenues through one time royalty payments and ongoing license fees 
in the future  we expect to license our technology and services indirectly through distribution arrangements with key partners other than network operators and set top box manufacturers  such as conditional access vendors  who will pay the applicable license and royalty fees directly to us 
we have also entered into license agreements with network operators that will pay us under a subscription based model  pursuant to which we are paid a monthly fee for each set top box that is shipped or deployed by the network operator for so long as that box remains in use by the network operator 
our royalties usually result from several different types of arrangements 
in the case of our set top box software  these may include initial deployments by new customers  the activation of new subscribers by existing customers  the shipment of additional set top boxes as replacements for older or defective set top boxes or for purposes of simply upgrading existing set top boxes  or sales of new products or services by the network operators that require new or updated set top boxes 
we have historically provided various types of prospective volume discounts on optional future deployments of our licensed middleware products  based on the volume of the customer s previous deployments of the particular licensed products  and expect that we will continue to do so in the future 
unless we are able to offset anticipated discounts through a change in product mix  upgrades to our software or other methods which enable us to charge higher fees  we may experience slower royalty growth as discounting is triggered 
a significant portion of our revenues is dependent upon our customers subscriber base  the growth in their subscriber base  and the related quantities of set top boxes deployed with our software 
specific royalty trends associated with set top box deployments by our customers are difficult to discern in many cases  as we do not control or directly influence actual deployment schedules of our customers 
however  our general experience in the past suggests that set top box deployments by our customers tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
because we receive most of our royalty reports one quarter in arrears  our royalty revenues in the past have generally been higher in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
we also derive fees from the licensing of other software products  such as opentv streamer  opentv eclipse and opentv participate 
these license fees can be in the form of one time  upfront payments by our customers  the total of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  or  in the case of our advanced advertising products  can be in the form of a recurring license fee  the total of which is less likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter

europe  middle east and africa accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenue in  an increase of million  or  compared to during the fourth quarter of  we amended some of the commercial and other terms of our license agreement with ugc and  in addition  delivered the final remaining licensed products  which resulted 
table of contents in the recognition of million in royalties and licenses revenue from ugc 
this included million of deferred revenue  which had been deferred since and was recognized as a result of the amendment and final delivery of all remaining licensed products during the fourth quarter of ugc revenues accounted for of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenue for bskyb directly and indirectly  primarily through three of our customers who sell set top boxes to bskyb  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenue for bskyb royalties and licenses revenue increased by million compared to primarily as a result of increased shipments of our software  particularly our pvr software 
we typically generate higher royalty rates from set top boxes that include our pvr software  such as the set top boxes shipped to bskyb  and we expect the number of pvr shipments to increase as network operators seek to deploy more pvr functionality in the future 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in royalties and licenses revenue from other customers of million  resulting from lower volumes of deployments by such customers 
the americas region accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenue in  a decrease of million  or  compared to echostar  including dish network and echostar technologies corporation  accounted for million  or  of our total worldwide royalties and licenses revenue for echostar royalties and licenses revenue declined million as compared to  due to reduced set top box shipments and to a reduction in amortization of deferred royalties as compared to our revenues had included the amortization of historic royalty payments we had received from echostar  which were being amortized over the original seven year term of the applicable middleware license agreement 
the middleware license agreement is currently renewable on an annual basis  and we now amortize revenues from echostar over the applicable one year renewal term 
royalties and licenses revenue from bell expressvu in canada declined million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to an amendment to our license agreement with bell expressvu entered into during the first quarter of that converted the pricing model from an upfront royalty to a recurring subscription fee per set top box  payable over the term of the customer s use of the set top box incorporating our middleware 
we expect the cumulative per set top box subscription fees paid by bell expressvu over the expected period of use of the set top box to more than compensate for the relative difference between the amount of the prior upfront royalty and the recurring subscription fee 
these reductions in royalties and licenses revenue were partially offset by increased royalties and licenses revenue from net in brazil of million  as compared to  reflecting increased deployments of our products  and an increase of million from licenses to our opentv eclipse product due to additional deployments by our customers 
royalties and licenses revenue from other customers in the region accounted for a net decrease of million compared to due to lower deployments of our products 
the asia pacific region accounted for million in royalties and licenses revenue in  an increase of million  or  compared to royalties and licenses revenue from jcom increased million due to additional deployments of our video on demand products by jcom beginning in the second quarter of sales of our opentv integrated browser product increased million in  as compared to  reflecting increased device sales by our customers 
increased royalty revenue from foxtel  for whom we first started recognizing revenues from middleware shipments during the second quarter of  accounted for an increase of million in these increases were partially offset by the one time recognition of million in license revenue from partitv during  pursuant to a contract that was terminated in the third quarter of royalties and licenses revenues from other customers accounted for a net decrease of million due to fewer deployments

in addition  royalties and licenses revenue from other customers in the region accounted for a net increase of million  resulting from higher volumes of deployments from such customers 
services and other services and other revenues consist primarily of professional services  maintenance and support  training  service usage fees  revenue sharing arrangements  and programming fees 
professional services revenues are generally derived from deployment and integration consulting engagements for network operators  set top box manufacturers  and system integrators 
service usage fees and revenue sharing arrangements were historically derived from our playmontecarlo gaming channel  which was sold in the fourth quarter of  and from revenue sharing arrangements for our advertising and other interactive services 
we also derived programming fees in from our nascar service agreement  which was not renewed for the season  and from other programmers 
maintenance  support and training revenues are generally realized as services are provided to network operators and set top box manufacturers 
a set top box manufacturer s decision to purchase maintenance and support from us depends largely on whether such manufacturer is actively shipping set top boxes with our software or reasonably expects to do so in quantities large enough to justify payment of these amounts  which  in both cases  is dependent upon such manufacturer s supply contracts with network operators and set top box demand by the network operator

we estimate that we had net united states federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at the end of  although our ability to make use of those tax loss carryforwards may be limited under applicable tax regulations 
the calculation of those tax loss carryforwards is a complex matter and may require a reassessment from time to time  which could result in changes to that estimate 
for all periods presented  substantially all federal tax benefits related to our losses have been offset by an increase in the valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax assets 
notwithstanding those federal tax loss carryforwards  we are subject to income taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and we have foreign taxes withheld from certain royalty payments

business segment results in august  ben bennett was appointed chief operating officer and acting chief executive officer and was subsequently appointed as chief executive officer in march accordingly  mr 
bennett is our chief operating decision maker  or codm 
as part of the management change in august  we reorganized our reporting units in an effort to provide management with better information for allocating the company s resources and assessing performance in accordance with the new management team s strategic focus 
our codm currently assesses our results and financial performance and reviews our internal budgeting reports on the basis of two segments middleware solutions and advertising solutions 
we have prepared this segment analysis in accordance with sfas  and accordingly  we have restated the segment information for all earlier periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
middleware solutions includes set top box middleware and embedded browser technologies  such as opentv spyglass  as well as software components that are deployed at the network operator s headend

table of contents our management reviews and assesses the contribution margin of each of these segments  which is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
we define contribution margin for these purposes as segment revenues less related  direct or indirect  allocable costs  including personnel and personnel related support costs  communications  facilities  maintenance support  consulting and subcontractor costs  travel  marketing and network infrastructure and bandwidth costs 
there are significant judgments management makes with respect to the direct and indirect allocation of costs that may affect the calculation of contribution margins 
while management believes these and other related judgments are reasonable and appropriate  others could assess such matters in ways different than our company s management 
contribution margin is a non gaap financial measure which excludes unallocated corporate support  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  share based compensation  impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangibles  other income  minority interest  restructuring provisions  and unusual items such as contract amendments that mitigated potential loss positions 
these exclusions reflect costs not considered directly allocable to individual business segments and result in a definition of contribution margin that does not take into account the substantial cost of doing business 
management believes that segment contribution margin is a helpful measure in evaluating the performance of our business segments 
while our management may consider contribution margin to be an important measure of comparative operating performance  this measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  loss from operations  net loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap that are otherwise presented in our financial statements 
in addition  our calculation of contribution margin may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be affected 
because these segments reflect the manner in which management reviews our business  they necessarily involve judgments that management believes are reasonable in light of the circumstances under which they are made 
these judgments may change over time or may be modified to reflect new facts or circumstances 
segments may also be changed or modified to reflect technologies and applications that are newly created  or that change over time  or other business conditions that evolve  each of which may result in reassessing specific segments and the elements included within each of those segments 
recent events  including changes in senior management  may affect the manner in which we present segments in the future

we have entered into multiple element arrangements for products and services with customers including most notably essel group which operates the dishtv network in india echostar s dish network foxtel innovative systems austar comcast 
table of contents portions of the amounts that we have invoiced to essel group  echostar  foxtel and austar under those arrangements have been deferred and will be recognized as revenue over time in our middleware solutions segment 
portions of those amounts that we have invoiced to comcast under our agreement with comcast will be recognized as revenue over time in our advertising solutions segment 
the arrangements with these customers include maintenance and support  for which vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value did not exist at the time the respective agreement was signed with each customer 
in addition  several of these arrangements provide for the delivery of specified future products  for which such evidence of fair value also did not exist 
all revenues under arrangements for which we are obligated to provide specified future products and for which we do not have vsoe  are initially deferred 
upon final delivery of all specified products under each arrangement  recognition will then depend on whether or not vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support exists 
in instances where vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support still does not exist  we will generally recognize all revenues from the arrangement either over the remaining contractual period of support or over the remaining period during which maintenance and support is expected to be provided 
in instances where vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support exists  we will generally recognize the maintenance and support revenues over the remaining period and all other deferred revenues upon the final delivery of the specified products 
as of december   we recorded million in deferred revenue compared with million at the end of of that total deferred amount at december   million  or  was deferred as a result of the arrangements with essel group  echostar  foxtel  innovative systems  austar  and comcast described in the preceding paragraphs 
the remaining million  or  of our deferred revenue as of december  was principally attributable to maintenance and support and professional services arrangements with other customers  which are typically short term in nature 
based on our current estimates of final delivery for all specified products  we expect the following recognition of the million of deferred revenue at december  resulting from the six customers listed in the preceding paragraph in millions year ending december  expected recognition of deferred revenue thereafter in order to determine the expected recognition of deferred revenue set forth in the foregoing table  we make judgments and estimates regarding  among other things  future product and services deliverables  the appropriate valuation of those products and services and expected changes in customer requirements 
these judgments and estimates could differ from actual events  particularly those that involve factors outside of our control 
as a result  the actual revenue recognized from these arrangements  and the timing of that recognition may differ from the amounts identified in this table 
while management believes that this information is a helpful measure in evaluating the company s performance  investors should understand that unless  and until  the company is actually able to recognize these amounts as revenue in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that the conditions to recognizing that revenue will be satisfied 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to be able to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities  if our assumptions about our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
because we cannot be certain that our assumptions about our business or the interactive television market in general will prove to be accurate  our funding requirements may differ from our current expectations 

table of contents our primary source of cash from operations is royalty payments from customers 
the primary uses of cash are personnel and personnel related costs  subcontractor and consulting costs  facilities costs  and capital expenditures 
in february  we received an additional million in cash from liberty after the expiration of the indemnity period specified in the stock purchase agreement between liberty and kudelski 
the mix of cash and short term and long term investments may change in the future as we make decisions regarding the composition of our investment portfolio 
we use professional investment management firms to manage a significant portion of our invested cash 
the portfolio consists of highly liquid  high quality investment grade securities of the united states government and agencies  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit that predominantly have maturities of less than three years 
all investments are made in accordance with our written investment policy  which has been approved by our board of directors

commitments and contractual obligations information as of december  concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations is summarized below in millions total due in due in due in due in or after operating leases obligations noncancellable purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have the right to terminate  without penalty  one of our operating leases prior to its scheduled expiration 
if we exercise this early termination right in  our future minimum lease commitments would be reduced by an aggregate of million over the current remaining life of that lease 
we have not yet made any determination as to whether we intend to exercise such right 
if we did exercise such right  while our commitments under this specific lease would be reduced  we might also be required to lease additional space to conduct our business and we cannot be certain  at this time  whether any such actions would possibly result in a net increase in our future minimum lease commitments 
in the ordinary course of business we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for marketing and other services 
future minimum purchase commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million for the year ending december  as of december   we had three standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million  two of which were issued to landlords of our leased properties  and one of which was issued to a sublessee at our new york facility  which we had vacated in the second quarter of we pledged two certificates of deposit aggregating approximately million  million of which was included under short term marketable debt securities  and million of which was included under long term marketable debt securities  as collateral in respect of these standby letters of credit 
indemnification in the normal course of our business  we provide indemnification to customers  subject to limitations  against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 

table of contents costs related to these indemnification provisions are sometimes difficult to estimate 
while we have not historically experienced significant costs for these matters  there may be occasions in the ordinary course of our business where we assume litigation and other costs on behalf of our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial position depending upon the outcome of any specific matter 
we ordinarily seek to limit our liabilities in those arrangements in various respects  including monetarily  but the costs associated with any type of intellectual property indemnification arrangement continue to escalate in general  and especially in the technology sector 
as permitted under the laws of the british virgin islands  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands fair value as of december  valuation of securities if interest rates decrease valuation of securities if interest rates increase valuation of securities if interest rates decrease valuation of securities if interest rates increase marketable debt securities 
table of contents the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuers of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars 
although a majority of our worldwide customers are invoiced and make payments in united states dollars  some of our customer contracts provide for payments to be remitted in local currency 
as of december   we held approximately million of various foreign currencies as a result of our worldwide operations 
we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management policy 
the policy permits the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts and the use of other hedging procedures in connection with hedging foreign currency exposures 
the policy requires that the use of derivatives and other procedures qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during  we did not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  options in hedging foreign currency exposures  or other hedging procedures 
however  we regularly assess our foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations  and we may in the future elect to make use of appropriate hedging strategies
