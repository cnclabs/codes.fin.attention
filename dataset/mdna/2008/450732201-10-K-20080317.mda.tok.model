item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations transaction with kpn bv on october   ibasis  inc and kpn completed transactions kpn transaction pursuant to which ibasis issued  shares of its common stock to kpn and acquired the outstanding shares of two subsidiaries of kpn  which encompassed kpn s international wholesale voice business 
the company also received million in cash from kpn  subject to post closing adjustments based on the working capital and debt of ibasis and kpn gcs 
immediately after issuance on october   the shares of ibasis common stock issued to kpn represented of the issued and outstanding shares of ibasis common stock on a fully diluted basis which includes all of the issued and outstanding common stock and the common stock underlying outstanding in the money stock options  as adjusted  and warrants to purchase common stock 
on october   ibasis paid a dividend in the amount of million at a rate of per share to each of its shareholders on the record date of september   the trading date immediately prior to the closing date of the kpn transaction 
in addition  holders of outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment upon the future exercise of these warrants in an amount equal to the dividend amount that would have been payable if the warrants had been exercised immediately prior to the record date of the dividend 
as of december   ibasis had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of its common stock 
in connection with the payment of the dividend to shareholders  we also increased the number of shares subject to unexercised stock options and decreased the exercise price of these stock option grants to preserve their value 
the officers of ibasis immediately prior to the closing of the kpn transaction have continued to serve as the officers of the combined company and one executive of kpn gcs  mr 
edwin van ierland  was appointed as the company s senior vice president worldwide sales 
upon closing of the kpn transaction  messrs 
charles skibo and david lee  two independent members of ibasis board of directors  resigned as members of the board of directors and the board of directors of ibasis appointed messrs 
eelco blok and joost farwerck  two executives of royal kpn nv  as directors to fill the vacancies created by the resignations of messrs 
skibo and lee 
although ibasis acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of kpn gcs  after the closing of the transaction  kpn holds a majority of the outstanding common stock of ibasis and kpn s designees are expected to represent  at a future date  a majority of the company s board of directors 
accordingly  for accounting and financial statement purposes  the kpn transaction has been treated as a reverse acquisition of ibasis by kpn gcs under the purchase method of accounting and the financial results of kpn gcs have become the historical financial results of the combined company and replace the historical financial results of ibasis as a stand alone company 
thus  the financial results reported for the full year include the results of kpn gcs alone for the first nine months of and the financial results of the combined company for the fourth quarter of only 
the presentation of the statement of stockholders equity reflects the historical stockholders equity of kpn gcs through september  the effect of the issuance of shares of ibasis common stock to kpn and the inclusion of ibasis s stockholders equity as a result of the closing of the kpn transaction on october  are reflected in the year ended december  prior to october   kpn gcs operated as an integrated part of kpn since inception and the historical financial statements of kpn gcs have been derived from the accounting records of kpn using the historical bases of assets and liabilities 
because kpn gcs did not operate as a stand alone business the historical financial statements may not necessarily be representative of amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements presented had kpn gcs operated independently of kpn 
kpn gcs benefited from certain related party revenue and purchase agreements with kpn that included sales prices per minute and costs per minute 
kpn gcs also relied on kpn for a substantial part of its operational and administrative support  for which it was allocated costs primarily consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  such as costs for centralized research  legal  human resources  payroll  accounting  employee benefits  real estate  insurance  information technology  telecommunications  treasury and other corporate and infrastructure costs 
in anticipation of the closing of the transaction with ibasis  kpn gcs entered into a framework services agreement with kpn in  which replaced the related party revenue and purchase agreements and operational and administrative support arrangements described above 
purchase accounting kpn gcs has been designated as the accounting acquirer because immediately following the completion of the transaction  the former shareholder of kpn gcs  kpn  held of the common stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and kpn s designees are expected to represent  at a future date  a majority of the combined company s board of directors 
as a result  the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
under this accounting  kpn gcs is considered the acquiring entity and ibasis is considered the acquired entity for financial reporting purposes 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of ibasis on the basis of their fair values on october   the closing date of the transaction 
as kpn gcs was not a publicly traded entity  the purchase price for this transaction was based  in part  on the fair market value of ibasis common stock 
the market price used to value ibasis shares of was the closing price of the stock on september   the business day immediately prior to the closing of the kpn transaction 
the total purchase price for this transaction consisted of the following in thousands ibasis outstanding shares on october  of  at per share  fair value of outstanding vested and unvested stock options  less unearned compensation  fair value of outstanding warrants to purchase common shares  direct acquisition costs  dividend to ibasis shareholders paid from existing ibasis cash and short term marketable securities  accrued dividend payable for outstanding warrants to purchase common shares  amount payable to kpn for ibasis working capital adjustment  accrued severance total purchase price  in determining the fair value of ibasis identifiable assets and liabilities as of october   we recorded million of amortizing intangible assets  including trade names and trademarks  customer relationships  termination partner relationships  and technology 
the estimated useful life of trade name and trademarks is years and is being amortized on a straight line basis 
the estimated useful life of customer relationships is years for wholesale customers and years for retail distributor relationships and these intangible assets are being amortized using an economic consumption method to reflect diminishing cash flows from these relationships in the future 
the estimated useful life of termination partner relationships is is years and is being amortized using an economic consumption method 
the estimated useful life of technology is years and is being amortized on a straight line basis 
the allocation of the purchase to the fair values of ibasis s assets and liabilities on october   which resulted in the recording of million in goodwill  is as follows in thousands current assets  property and equipment  other assets trade names and trademarks  customer relationships  termination partner relationships  technology  total assets  deferred revenue  dividend payable  other current liabilities  deferred tax liabilities  long term  other non current liabilities  total liabilities  net assets  goodwill  total purchase price  the total million of goodwill has been assigned to the company s wholesale trading reporting unit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  this goodwill will not be amortized 
working capital and debt adjustments in accordance with the share purchase agreement for the kpn transaction  a post closing adjustment was required if i ibasis working capital was lower than or exceeded  ii ibasis debt exceeded or was lower than  iii the combined working capital of kpn gcs was lower than or exceeded  and or iv the combined debt of kpn gcs exceeded  as of the date of the closing of the kpn transaction 
based on ibasis s balance sheet position on the date of the closing of the kpn transaction  working capital was  less than the specified level of  and debt was  less than the specified level of  as a result  a payment of  is due to kpn from ibasis 
based on kpn gcs s balance sheet position on the date of the closing of the kpn transaction  working capital exceeded the specified level of  by  and debt was at the specified level of as a result  payment of  is due to kpn from ibasis 
the total post closing adjustment of  due to kpn will be paid by ibasis in three successive quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of company overview we are a leading wholesale carrier of international long distance telephone calls and a provider of retail prepaid calling services and enhanced services for mobile operators 
our operations consist of our wholesale tading business trading  revenue from traffic we terminate for kpn and its affiliates outsourced from kpn  and our retail services business retail 
in the wholesale trading business we receive voice traffic from buyers originating carriers who are interconnected to our network via voice over internet protocol voip or traditional time division multiplexing tdm connections  and we route that traffic over our network to sellers local service providers and carriers in the destination countries with whom we have established agreements to manage the completion or termination of calls 
following the closing of the kpn transaction  approximately half of our traffic utilizes tdm connections  while the balance of traffic is carried over our global voip network 
we use proprietary  patent pending technology in our global voip network to automate the selection of routes and termination partners based on a variety of performance  quality  and business metrics 
we offer our wholesale trading service on a wholesale basis to carriers  mobile operators  consumer voip companies  telephony resellers and other service providers worldwide 
we have call termination agreements with local service providers in more than countries in north america  europe  asia  the middle east  latin america  africa and australia 
we seek to expand our market share in our wholesale trading business by expanding our customer base and by introducing cost effective international voice solutions for our customers  including complete outsourcing of international operations 
our outsourced from kpn business consists of traffic we terminate for kpn and its affiliates for international wholesale voice services and international direct dialing for calls originating or terminating in the netherlands 
our retail business consists of retail prepaid calling cards  which are marketed through distributors primarily to ethnic communities within major metropolitan markets in the united states  and pingo  a prepaid calling service that we offer and sell directly to consumers via an ecommerce model 
both can be private labeled for other service providers 
the prepaid calling card business and pingo leverage our existing international network and have the potential to deliver higher margins than are typically achieved in the wholesale trading business 
in addition  the retail prepaid calling card business typically has a faster cash collection cycle than the wholesale trading business 
in we launched pingobusiness  enhancements that enable businesses to manage multiple pingo accounts through a single administrative account 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to i make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and ii disclose contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used or a change in the estimates is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors that we consider reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future financial condition and results of operations will be affected 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition 
for our wholesale trading business and our outsourced from kpn business  revenue is derived from the sale of minutes of calling time 
we recognize revenue in the period the service is provided  net of estimates for incentive rebates and other allowances 
these estimates are based upon contracted terms  historical experience and information currently available to management with respect to business and economic trends 
revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in cases where we have to estimate the monthly revenues related to traffic terminated in that month  we record a receivable that is based upon internal traffic reporting which will then be billed and collected in the subsequent months 
for our retail business  revenue is deferred upon activation of the cards  or purchase of our web based calling services  and is only recognized as the prepaid balances are reduced based upon minute usage and service charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon their payment history and current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and record a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover estimated losses in customer accounts receivable balances under current conditions 
however  changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts may be necessary in the event that the financial condition of our customers improves or deteriorates 
in addition  changes may be necessary if we adjust credit limits for new customers or change our collection practices 
either of these situations may result in write off patterns that differ from our experience 
we have been able to mitigate our credit risk  in part  by using reciprocal arrangements with customers  who are also our suppliers  to offset our outstanding receivables 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of goodwill  which has an indefinite life and is not being amortized  and identifiable intangible assets  consisting of trade name and trade marks  customer relationships  termination partner relationships and technology 
the estimated useful life of trade name and trademarks is years and is being amortized on a straight line basis 
the estimated useful life of customer relationships is years for wholesale customers and years for retail distributor relationships  and these intangible assets are being amortized using an economic consumption method to reflect diminishing cash flows from these relationships in the future 
the estimated useful life of termination partner relationships is years and is being amortized using an economic consumption method 
the estimated useful life of technology is years and is being amortized on a straight line basis 
valuation of long lived assets 
valuation of certain long lived assets including property and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill requires significant judgment 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in the kpn transaction was assigned to intangible assets and goodwill 
assigning value to intangible assets requires that we use significant judgment in determining i the fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible assets will be amortized 
we utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques  such as the income approach and the cost approach  as appropriate  in establishing the fair value of long lived assets 
typically  key assumptions include projected revenue and expense levels used in establishing the fair value of business acquisitions as well as discount rates based on an analysis of our weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets 
changes in the initial assumptions could lead to changes in amortization expense recorded in our future financial statements 
for intangible assets and property and equipment  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant changes or developments in strategy or operations which affect our intellectual or tangible properties 
should we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows  including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets 
we perform annual reviews for impairment of goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and cash earnings multiples  and compare the values to our estimated overall market capitalization 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in such jurisdictions 
in addition  we have a valuation allowance related to tax benefits from stock option exercises which will increase equity when recognized  and loss carry forwards acquired in the acquisition of kpn gcs a reverse acquisition  the recognition of which will reduce goodwill 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we may record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
prior to we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
judgment is required in determining our income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties  transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries  and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe our judgments are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact  unfavorable or favorable  on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of a liability will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that an assessment is greater than the recorded liability 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as percentages of net revenue 
year ended december  net revenue from external parties net revenue from related parties total net revenue costs and operating expenses data communications and telecommunications costs external parties data communications and telecommunications costs related parties engineering and network operations expenses selling  general and administrative expenses merger related expenses depreciation and amortization total costs and operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense foreign exchange loss income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations for the year ended december  includes the results of operations of kpn gcs only for the first nine months of and the results of the combined company following the closing of kpn transaction on october   for the fourth quarter of results of operations for the year ended december  are the results of operations of kpn gcs only 
as a result  revenue and operating expenses for the year ended december  increased substantially 
net revenue 
our primary source of revenue from external parties are the fees that we charge customers for completing voice and fax calls over our network 
we charge our customers fees  per minute of traffic  that are dependent on the length and destination of the call and recognize this revenue in the period in which the call is completed 
revenue from related parties consists of fees that we charge kpn and its affiliates for the traffic they send to us to complete over our network 
the fees that we charge kpn and its affiliates are based on the pricing in established service level agreements 
our average revenue per minute arpm is based upon our total net revenue divided by the number of minutes of traffic over our network for the applicable period 
arpm is a key telecommunications industry financial measurement 
we believe this measurement is useful in understanding our financial performance  as well as industry trends 
although the long distance telecommunications industry has been experiencing declining prices in recent years due to the effects of deregulation and increased competition  our average revenue per minute can fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in traffic over our network to higher priced  or lower priced  destinations 
total revenue was million for compared to million for revenue from external parties was million in compared to million in the increase in revenue from external parties reflects a combination of the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and the inclusion of ibasis revenue of million for the fourth quarter of as the revenue of kpn gcs is primarily denominated in euros  the stronger euro in resulted in an increase in revenue from external parties of approximately in us dollars in excluding the effect of the stronger euro in and the inclusion of ibasis revenue for the fourth quarter of  revenue from external parties declined approximately from the decrease was primarily due to the focus on maximizing margins in  which resulted in a decrease in revenue and minutes from lower margin traffic 
revenue from related parties in was million  compared to million in the lower revenue primarily reflects the pricing in service level agreements established between kpn gcs and kpn in mid  in anticipation of the completion of the kpn transaction 
prior to these new service level agreements  kpn gcs had more favorable pricing arrangements with kpn 
minutes of traffic in were billion minutes compared to billion minutes for excluding the effect of the inclusion of ibasis traffic for the fourth quarter of  minutes of traffic increased by billion minutes  or  in over average revenue per minute was cents per minute in compared to cents per minute in data communications and telecommunications costs 
data communications and telecommunications costs are composed primarily of termination and circuit costs 
termination costs are paid to local service providers  or to kpn and its affiliates  to terminate voice and fax calls received from our network 
termination costs are negotiated with the local service providers and termination costs for traffic we send to kpn and its affiliates are based primarily on pricing in service level agreements 
circuit costs primarily include fees for connections between our network and our customers and or service provider partners and charges for internet access at our internet central offices 
total data communications and telecommunications costs were million in  compared to million in data communications and telecommunications costs from external parties were million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the effect of the stronger euro  compared to the us dollar  in on kpn gcs s euro denominated costs and the inclusion of ibasis costs of million for the fourth quarter of data communications and telecommunications costs from related parties were million in  compared to million in the lower costs from related parties were primarily due to the closing of an interconnection with a kpn affiliate and lower pricing associated with the service level agreements established with kpn for as a percentage of total net revenue  total data communications and telecommunications costs were in compared to in engineering and network operations expenses 
engineering and network operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating and supporting our network and expenses for operating our network operations centers 
also included in this category are engineering expenses incurred in developing  enhancing and supporting our network and our proprietary software applications 
engineering and network operations support of the kpn gcs network are provided by kpn and charged to kpn gcs under a service level agreement 
engineering and network operations expenses were million for compared to million for the higher expenses in relate to the costs of ibasis engineering and network operations expenses of million for the fourth quarter of  partially offset by lower charges under the service level agreement between kpn and kgcs in  compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  payroll tax and benefit expenses  and other costs for sales and marketing functions and general corporate functions  including executive management  finance  legal  facilities  information technology and human resources 
kpn has historically provided certain corporate functions  including finance  information technology and human resources  and charged kpn gcs for this support under a service level agreement 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase in primarily reflects the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative costs of ibasis of million for the fourth quarter of in addition  the stronger euro compared to the us dollar resulted in an increase in the euro denominated expenses of kpn gcs 
these increases were partially offset by lower costs in the service level agreement for support from kpn 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we took a charge of million related to retroactive universal service fund and other regulatory fees  relating to our prepaid calling service revenue prior to july this charge resulted from a decision by the us court of appeals  in early december  which denied our appeal of the retroactive aspect of a federal communications commission order issued in june merger related expenses 
merger related expenses of million in primarily relate to costs incurred for the preparation and review of the historical financial statements of kpn gcs in anticipation of the merger with ibasis 
these costs have been paid by kpn but are reflected in our results of operations for depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million in  compared to million in amortization expense in includes million in amortization of indentified intangible assets 
these identified intangible assets resulted from the allocation of the purchase price of ibasis to the fair value of ibasis net assets as of october  depreciation and amortization expense in also included a million charge in the fourth quarter of for the write off of certain costs previously capitalized by kpn gcs 
interest income 
interest income was million for  compared to million in the increase in interest income primarily relates higher average cash balances in interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to  in interest expense in includes interest of million on bank borrowings of million early in the fourth quarter of under the our line of credit with silicon valley bank 
foreign exchange loss  net 
foreign exchange loss  net was million in  compared to million in these foreign exchange losses are primarily a result of the change in exchange rates between the euro and us dollar on foreign currency contracts 
income taxes 
the income tax provision of million in and million in primarily relates to income taxes on the taxable income of the netherlands operations of kpn gcs 
the effective tax rate in and was and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in is due to us operating losses for which there is no current tax benefit 
the effective tax rate in approximates the statutory rate in the netherlands 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue 
total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in traffic carried over the kpn gcs network increased by from approximately billion minutes in to approximately billion minutes in as a result of continued worldwide growth of kpn gcs market share in the international voice market 
the increase in traffic was offset by a decrease in average revenue per minute of from cents in to cents in the decrease was mainly the result of a decrease in mobile termination rates imposed by local regulators in many countries  partially offset by a proportionately higher mix of higher priced mobile terminating minutes compared to lower priced fixed terminating minutes  and also the termination of minutes in exotic destinations where regulated tariffs are not yet effective 
in  kpn gcs implemented a twofold strategy to increase its market share in the international voice market 
in conjunction with this strategy  kpn gcs opened new sales offices in emerging markets such as africa  asia and the middle east and was therefore able to obtain new wholesale customers and suppliers 
this strategy was called the regional approach 
in addition kpn gcs developed a new product portfolio for the mobile market  called the mobile matrix  which consisted of a comprehensive set of value added services such as sms interworking  mms interworking and g video gateway 
net revenue external parties increased by from million in to million in in  kpn gcs continued the regional approach strategy it implemented in  and also established additional direct interconnection with mobile networks in europe which created a competitive advantage as it eliminated its use of third party operators for call termination 
in addition  kpn gcs also expanded its sales force to increase the focus on its main markets in the united states and western europe 
as a result of these efforts  kpn gcs terminated more minutes at mobile networks during  which is higher priced traffic  and less at fixed networks 
the increase of mobile volume more than offset the decrease in mobile termination rates imposed by local regulators in many countries 
due to this strategy  kpn gcs was able to maintain its top line revenue growth from external parties 
net revenue related parties decreased by from million in to million in the decrease of net revenue related parties in compared to was caused by a change in the service level agreement with kpn regarding the kpn fixed retail traffic partly offset by substantial growth of mobile traffic coming from internal mobile operators 
in  the market share of traffic coming from the kpn mobile group kpn mobile  e plus and base increased significantly due to the internal decision of routing nearly all international calls through kpn gcs 
data communications and telecommunications costs 
the total increase in data communications and telecommunications costs was primarily driven by the growth in external revenue 
total costs increased by from million in to million in the main driver of the increase in total costs was the increase in mobile volume due to kpn gcs increased market share in premium mobile minutes and overall mobile market growth  partially offset by lower mobile termination rates imposed by local regulators in many countries 
data communications and telecommunication costs external parties increased by from million in to million in  primarily due to a increase in volume both fixed and mobile from external parties and the termination of relatively more mobile minutes which have higher associated costs 
data communications and telecommunication costs related parties decreased by from million in to million in the decrease in these costs was mainly caused by lower mobile termination rates imposed by local regulators in the netherlands and germany as well as a service level agreement adjustment in between kpn gcs and kpn which lowered prices for national and international transmission 
engineering and network operations expenses 
engineering and network operations expenses were million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the new service level agreements between kpn gcs and kpn becomining effective from june  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the new service level agreements between kpn gcs and kpn becoming effective from june  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased from million in to million in as a result of a lower asset base due to retirements that occurred during interest income 
interest income in was  compared to  in the increase is due to the fact that from april   kpn gcs entered into a financial current account with royal kpn  which was utilized as a clearing account to settle inter company balances and bore interest at a rate of 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in the decrease relates to the payment of the last installment of a note payable to an affiliate in early which yielded interest at libor plus 
foreign exchange loss 
foreign exchange loss on foreign currency contracts decreased from million in to million in the loss was primarily due to the changes in exchange rates us dollar versus euro during these periods 
income tax expense 
the income tax expense was million compared to million in  with the effective tax rate being in compared to in  which does not materially differ from the dutch statutory tax rate for such years 
liquidity and capital resources prior to october   kpn gcs operated from inception as an integrated part of kpn and within the kpn infrastructure 
kpn uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations 
historically  cash was remitted to kpn on a regular basis and cash disbursements were funded from kpn cash accounts on behalf of kpn gcs 
cash remittances to kpn  net of disbursements by kpn on behalf of kpn gcs  are reflected as net distributions to related parties in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
cash flows from operating activities of million in was primarily the result of net income of million  non cash charges of million  primarily depreciation and amortization  and changes in other assets and liabilities of million 
changes in other assets and liabilities included a decline in accounts receivable external parties of million and in accounts receivable related parties of million  partially offset by a decline in accounts payable of million 
cash flows from operating activities in of million was the result of net income of million  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  and changes in other assets and liabilities of million 
changes in other assets and liabilities in included an increase in accounts receivable related parties of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable external parties of million 
cash flows from operating activities in of million was the result of net income of million  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  and changes in other assets and liabilities of million 
changes in other assets and liabilities include a decrease in accounts receivable external parties of million and a decrease in accounts receivable related parties of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
cash flows from investing activities in of million included the acquisition of million of existing cash and cash equivalents of ibasis on the date of the closing of the kpn transaction 
additions to property and equipment were million in and an increase of million in other assets relates to other investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in of million and in of million relate to additions to property and equipment 
cash used in financing activities in was million and included million paid by kpn as partial consideration for the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of ibasis on october  in early october  following the completion of the kpn transaction  we paid a million dividend to ibasis shareholders of record immediately preceding the closing of the kpn transaction 
in addition  we paid million in dividends to warrant holders who exercised their warrants during the fourth quarter of net distributions to kpn in were million 
in the fourth quarter of  we borrowed million under our second amended and restated loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
proceeds from exerices of stock options and warrants were million in and payments of capital lease obligations were million 
cash used in financing activities in was million and consisted of net distributions to kpn of million and payment of a note payable to a kpn affiliate of million 
cash used in financing activities in was million and consisted of net distributions to kpn of million and payment of a note payable to a kpn affiliate of million 
in accordance with the share purchase agreement for the kpn transaction  a post closing adjustment was required if i ibasis working capital was lower than or exceeded  ii ibasis debt exceeded or was lower than  iii the combined working capital of kpn gcs was lower than or exceeded  and or iv the combined debt of kpn gcs exceeded  as of the date of the closing of the kpn transaction

the total post closing adjustment of  due to kpn will be paid by ibasis in three successive quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of and is included in accounts payable related parties as of december  on october   we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank  which amended and restated a certain amended and restated loan and security agreement dated as of december  we entered into the loan agreement to obtain funding for working capital purposes and in support of the kpn transaction 
pursuant to the loan agreement  we may borrow up to million from time to time under a secured revolving credit facility for a two year period 
borrowings under the line of credit will be on a formula basis  based on eligible domestic and foreign accounts receivable 
the line of credit contains quarterly financial covenants  consisting primarily of minimum profitability and minimum liquidity requirements 
interest on borrowings under the line of credit will be based  in part  on our quarterly profitability  with the maximum interest rate being the bank s prime rate  plus  or libor  plus 
the line of credit has a quarterly commitment fee of on any unused portion of the line of credit and an up front  one time facility fee of  or  the revolving credit facility is also guaranteed by all our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first priority lien and security interest on the assets of ibasis and such guarantors 
in addition  ibasis has pledged of all its ownership in kpn global carrier services bv  a wholly owned subsidiary based in the netherlands  as collateral for the revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement  we may use the proceeds solely as i working capital  ii to fund its general business requirements  and iii to fund the dividend paid by us in connection with the kpn transaction 
subsequent to december   we signed a non binding term sheet with silicon valley bank to initate the process of amending the loan agreement to expand our borrowing capability from million to million 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding and had issued outstanding standby letters of credit of million under the loan agreement 
we anticipate that the december  balance of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with expected net cash flow generated from operations and bank borrowing availability  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital asset expenditures for the next twelve months 
we expect capital asset expenditures to be between million and million in off balance sheet arrangements under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement  if any  will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolution of those examinations is uncertain

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk which can create volatility in earnings and cash flows from period to period 
historically  kpn gcs sought to economically hedge a portion of its foreign currency risk arising from foreign exchange receivables and foreign currency denominated forecasted transactions 
foreign exchange contracts were used to fix or protect the exchange rate to be used for foreign currency denominated transactions 
hedge accounting was not applied in the historical financial statements of kpn gcs 
we do not currently engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk and have not purchased options or entered into swaps or forward or futures contracts 
our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars or euros 
thus  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our foreign entities are translated into us dollars 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  if the dollar weakens relative to the euro  our euro denominated revenues and expenses would increase when stated in us dollars 
conversely  if the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro  our euro denominated revenues and expenses would decrease 
our short term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk  but due to the short term nature of these investments  interest rates would not have a material impact on their value at december  our primary interest rate risk is the risk on borrowings under our bank line of credit  which is subject to interest rates based on the bank s prime rate or libor  plus margin 
we had million in borrowings under our bank line of credit at december  a change in the applicable interest rates would also affect the rate at which we could borrow funds or finance equipment purchases 
our capital lease obligations are fixed rate debt
