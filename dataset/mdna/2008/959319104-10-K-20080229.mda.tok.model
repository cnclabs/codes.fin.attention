table of contents refining segment our refining group operates four refineries one in el paso  texas el paso refinery  two in the four corners region of northern new mexico  one near gallup and one in bloomfield  four corners refineries  and one near yorktown  virginia yorktown refinery 
each of these refineries has its own product distribution terminal 
it also operates a crude oil transportation and gathering pipeline system in the four corners region of new mexico  an asphalt plant in el paso  two finished stand alone products distribution terminals  four asphalt distribution terminals  and a fleet of crude oil and finished product transportation trucks 
principal products 
the four refineries make various grades of gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel and other products from crude oil  other feedstocks  and blending components 
we also acquire finished products through exchange agreements and from various third party suppliers 
we sell these products through our own service stations and wholesale group  independent wholesalers and retailers  commercial accounts  and sales and exchanges with major oil companies 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for detail on production by refinery 
the following table summarizes sales percentage by product for  and year ended december  gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel asphalt other total customers 
we sell a variety of refined products to our diverse customer base 
chevron products company  or chevron  was the only external customer accounting for more than of consolidated net sales for we have a five year offtake agreement with chevron that expires in august with certain renewal rights 
all sales were domestic sales in the united states  except for sales of gasoline and diesel fuel for export into mexico 
the sales for export were to pmi trading limited  an affiliate of petroleos mexicanos  the mexican state owned oil company  and accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
we also purchase additional refined products from other refiners to supplement supply to our customers 
these products are similar to the products that we currently manufacture 
competition 
we operate in the us southwest  rocky mountain and mid continent regions  which include the areas of west texas  arizona  new mexico  utah  colorado  and the mid atlantic region 
refined products are supplied to these regions from our refineries  from other refineries in these regions and from refineries located in other regions via interstate pipelines 
these areas have substantial refining capacity 
petroleum refining and marketing is highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors affecting us are costs of crude oil and other feedstocks  refinery efficiency  refinery product mix  and costs of product distribution and transportation 
because of their geographic diversity  larger and more complex refineries  integrated operations  and greater resources  some of our competitors may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions  to compete on the basis of price  to obtain crude oil in times of shortage  and to bear the economic risk inherent in all phases of the refining industry 
in the southwest  the el paso and the four corners refineries primarily compete with valero energy corp  conocophillips company  alon usa energy  inc  holly corporation  flying j  inc  tesoro corporation  chevron and suncor energy  inc as well as refineries in other regions of the country that serve the regions we serve through pipelines 
the longhorn refined products pipeline runs approximately miles from the houston area of the gulf coast to el paso and has an estimated maximum capacity of  bpd 
this pipeline provides gulf coast refiners and other shippers with improved access to west texas and new mexico 
any additional supply provided by this pipeline or by the kinder morgan energy partners  lp  or kinder morgan  pipeline expansion could lower prices and increase price volatility in areas that we serve and could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
in the northeast  our yorktown refinery primarily competes with sunoco  inc  valero energy corp  conocophillips company  hess corporation and other refineries in the gulf coast via the colonial pipeline  which runs from the gulf coast area to new jersey 
we also compete with offshore refiners that deliver product by water transport 

table of contents southwest el paso refinery our el paso refinery consists of a  bpd south refinery  with approximately million barrels of storage capacity and a  bpd north refinery  with approximately million barrels of storage capacity  a product terminal and asphalt plant and terminal 
this refinery is well situated to serve two separate geographic areas  which allows us to diversify our market pricing exposure 
tucson and phoenix reflect a west coast  market pricing structure  while el paso  albuquerque and juarez typically reflect a gulf coast market pricing structure 
process summary 
our el paso refinery is a nominal  bpd crude oil throughput cracking facility that has historically run wti crude oil to optimize the yields of higher value refined products  which currently account for over of our production output 
the existing metallurgy at the el paso refinery  combined with various refinery initiatives we are currently pursuing  will give us the flexibility to process significantly more west texas sour  or wts  crude oil  which typically is less expensive than wti crude oil 
power supply 
electricity is supplied to our refinery by a regional electric company via two separate feeders to both the north and south sides of our refinery 
we have an electrical power curtailment plan to conserve power in the event of a partial outage 
in addition  we have multiple small  automatic starting emergency generators to supply electricity for essential lighting and controls in the event of a power outage 
natural gas is supplied to our refinery via two pipelines 
one transportation agreement is on an interruptible basis while the other is on an uninterruptible basis 
we purchase our natural gas at market rates 
raw material supply 
the primary inputs for our refinery consist of crude oil  iso butane and alkylate 
we currently have the capacity to process approximately  bpd of crude oil  of which approximately is wti crude oil 
we currently are pursuing various refinery initiatives that  once completed  will give us the flexibility to process significantly more wts crude oil 
the following table describes the historical feedstocks for our el paso refinery percentage for year ended refinery feedstocks year ended december  december  bpd crude oils sweet crude oil sour crude oil total crude oils other feedstocks blendstocks intermediates and other blendstocks total other feedstocks blendstocks total crude oil other feedstocks blendstocks crude oil is delivered to our el paso refinery via a mile crude oil pipeline owned and operated by kinder morgan 
the system handles both sweet wti and sour wts crude oil 
the main trunkline into el paso is used solely for the supply of crude oil to us  on a published tariff 
we acquired the crude oil pipeline in from chevron 
in  we sold the crude oil pipeline to kinder morgan  and we simultaneously entered into a year crude oil transportation agreement with kinder morgan 
the crude oil pipeline has access to the majority of the producing fields in the permian basin  which gives us access to a plentiful supply of wti and wts crude oil from fields with long reserve lives 
we generally buy our crude oil under contracts with various crude oil providers  including a contract with kinder morgan that expires in and shorter term contracts with other suppliers  at market based rates 
we also have access to blendstocks and refined products from the gulf coast through the magellan south system pipeline that runs from the gulf coast to our refinery 
refined products transportation 
outside of the el paso area  which is supplied via our el paso refinery product terminal  we provide refined products to other areas  including tucson  phoenix  albuquerque and juarez  mexico 
supply to these areas is achieved through pipeline systems that are linked to our refinery 
our refined products are delivered to tucson and phoenix through the kinder morgan east line  which was expanded to over  bpd in the fourth quarter of  and to albuquerque and juarez  mexico through pipelines owned by plains all american pipeline 
table of contents lp  or plains 
we also sell our refined products at our product marketing terminal and rail loading facilities in el paso 
another pipeline owned by kinder morgan provides diesel fuel to the union pacific railway in el paso 
both kinder morgan s east line and the plains pipeline to albuquerque are interstate pipelines regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  and have historically operated near capacity year round 
the tariff provisions for these pipelines include prorating policies that grant historical shippers line space that is consistent with their prior activities as well as a prorated portion of any expansions 
four corners refineries our refining group operates two refineries in the four corners region of northern new mexico 
we operate the two refineries in an integrated fashion 
our gallup refinery has a crude oil throughput capacity of  barrels per day 
it is located on approximately acres near gallup  new mexico 
our bloomfield refinery has a crude oil throughput capacity of  barrels per day 
it is located on acres near farmington  new mexico 
we typically have not operated these refineries at these capacity levels 
arizona  colorado  new mexico and utah are the primary areas for the refined products and also are the primary source of crude oil and natural gas liquids supplies for both refineries 
process summary 
the four corners refineries produce a high percentage of high value products

our pipeline system reaches into the san juan basin  located in the four corners area  and connects with local common carrier pipelines 
we currently own approximately miles of pipeline for gathering and delivering crude oil to the refineries 
our gallup refinery receives natural gas liquids primarily through a mile pipeline we own that is connected to a natural gas liquids processing plant 
the west texas sweet comes from the permian basin region of west texas and southeast new mexico and is delivered on a pipeline system operated as a common carrier line with ferc tariffs by our wholly owned subsidiary  western refining pipeline company 
this pipeline runs from lynch to bisti  new mexico and began delivering crude oil to our four corners refineries in august this incremental supply of crude oil in the four corners region provides enough feedstock for our two four corners refineries to run at full capacity rates  bpd 
see item a 
risk factors we may not be able to run our four corners refineries at increased rates 
we supplement the crude oil used at our refineries with other feedstocks 
these other feedstocks currently include locally produced natural gas liquids and condensate as well as other feedstocks produced outside of the four corners area 
the following table describes the historical feedstocks for our four corners refineries percentage for june june through through refinery feedstocks december  december  bpd crude oil sweet crude oil total crude oil other feedstocks blendstocks intermediates blendstocks slop oil total other feedstocks blendstocks total crude oil other feedstocks and blendstocks 
table of contents our gallup refinery is capable of processing approximately  barrels per day of natural gas liquids 
an adequate supply of natural gas liquids is available for delivery to our gallup refinery primarily through a pipeline we own that connects the refinery to a natural gas liquids processing plant 
we purchase crude oil from a number of sources  including major oil companies and independent producers  under arrangements that contain market responsive pricing provisions 
many of these arrangements are subject to cancellation by either party or have terms of one year or less 
in addition  these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation  which could result in our paying higher or lower relative prices for crude oil 
terminal operations

our refining group or wholesale group supply substantially all the gasoline and diesel fuel that the retail group sells 
we purchase general merchandise and food products from various suppliers 
at february   our retail group operated service stations with convenience stores or kiosks located in arizona  new mexico and colorado 
the main competitive factors affecting our retail segment are the location of the stores  brand identification  and product price and quality 
our service stations compete with valero energy corp  chevron  alon energy usa  shell oil company and conocophillips 
large chains of retailers like costco wholesale corp  wal mart stores inc  and albertson s inc are entering the motor fuel retail business 
many of these competitors are substantially larger than us and because of their integrated operations  may be better able to withstand volatile conditions in the fuel market and lower profitability in merchandise sales 
on february   our retail group had units branded conoco pursuant to a strategic branding licensing agreement 
in addition  units were branded mustang  units were branded giant  units were branded shell  eight units were branded phillips  two units were branded thriftway  one unit was branded mobil  and one unit was branded sundial

the wholesale group purchases petroleum fuels and lubricants from the refining group and from third party suppliers 
our principal customers are the mining  construction  utility  manufacturing  transportation  aviation and agricultural industries 
no single external customer accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales 
we compete with other wholesale petroleum products distributors in the areas we serve like flying j  inc  pro petroleum  inc  southern counties fuels  union distributing  brown evans distributing co  and maxum petroleum  inc governmental regulation all of our operations and properties are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental and health and safety regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of petroleum and hazardous substances  the emission and discharge of materials into the environment  waste management  and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels 
our operations also require numerous permits and authorizations under various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws generally could result in fines  penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits 
we have made  and will continue to make  significant capital and other expenditures related to environmental and health and safety compliance  including with respect to our air permits and the low sulfur gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel regulations 
furthermore  we expect to make significant environmental capital expenditures in connection with the planned capacity expansion and upgrade of our refinery 
for additional details on capital expenditures related to regulatory requirements and our refinery capacity expansion and upgrade  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending 
periodically  we receive communications from various federal  state and local governmental authorities asserting violation s of environmental laws and or regulations 
these governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective action for these asserted violations 
we intend to respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action 
we do not anticipate that any such matters currently asserted will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
el paso refinery in may  we entered into an agreed order with the texas natural resources conservation commission for remediation of the south side of the el paso refinery property 
on august   we purchased a pollution and legal liability and clean up cost cap insurance policy at a cost of million  which we expensed in fiscal the policy is non cancelable and covers environmental clean up costs related to contamination that occurred prior to december   including the costs of the agreed order activities 
the insurance provider assumes responsibility for all environmental clean up costs related to the agreed order up to million 
under the policy  environmental costs outside the scope of the agreed order require payment by us of a deductible as well as any costs that exceed the covered limits of the insurance policy 
we are not aware of any other environmental costs that may be necessary  and therefore  cannot reasonably estimate a liability  if any  for any other deductibles 
in addition  under a settlement agreement with us  a subsidiary of chevron is obligated to pay of any agreed order environmental clean up costs that would otherwise have been covered under the policy but that exceed the million threshold 
pursuant to the purchase agreement relating to the purchase of the north side of the el paso refinery  chevron retained responsibility for  and control of  certain remediation activities 
we are not presently aware of any additional environmental costs that it would be responsible for relating to the assets acquired  and therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate a liability  if any 
the us environmental protection agency  or epa has embarked on a petroleum refinery enforcement initiative epa initiative whereby it is investigating industry wide noncompliance with certain clean air act rules 
the epa initiative has resulted in many refiners entering into consent decrees typically requiring substantial capital expenditures for additional air pollution control equipment and penalties 
since december  we have been voluntarily discussing a settlement pursuant to the epa initiative related to the el paso refinery 
negotiations with the epa regarding this initiative have focused exclusively on air emission programs 
we do not expect these negotiations to result in any soil or groundwater remediation or clean up requirements 
while at this time it is not known precisely how the epa initiative or any resulting settlement may affect us  we expect to be required to pay penalties and to install additional pollution controls  and  as a result  our operating costs and capital expenditures may increase 
based on current negotiations and information  we have revised and estimated the total capital expenditures that may be required for the el paso refinery pursuant to the epa initiative would be approximately million of which million remains to be spent 
these capital expenditures would primarily be for installation of a flare gas recovery system on the south side of the el paso refinery and installation of nitrogen oxides  nox  emission controls at the refinery 
as of december   we completed a flare gas recovery system at a cost of million 
the remaining expenditures for the nox emission controls project of million will occur from through these amounts have been included in our estimated capital expenditures 
table of contents for regulatory projects 
these estimates could change as a result of a final settlement with epa regarding the el paso refinery under the epa initiative if the epa requires additional nox controls beyond those already planned for  or requires other additional air pollution controls 
based on current information  we do not expect any settlement pursuant to the epa initiative to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations or that any penalties or increased operating costs related to the epa initiative will be material 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  capital spending  elsewhere in this annual report 
in april  we received a payment of reparations in the amount of million from a pipeline company as ordered by the ferc 
while we and the pipeline company have sought judicial review of the ferc order  as well as a series of other orders  the pipeline company made a compliance filing in which it asserts it overpaid reparations to us in a total amount of  including accrued interest through april   and that interest should continue to accrue 
yorktown refinery giant assumed certain liabilities and obligations in connection with the purchase of the yorktown refinery from bp corporation north america inc and bp products north america inc  or collectively bp 
bp  however  agreed to reimburse giant for all losses that are caused by or relate to property damage caused by  or any environmental remediation required due to  a violation of environmental  health  and safety laws during bp s operation of the refinery  subject to certain limitations bp s liability for reimbursement is limited to million 
yorktown and orders 
in connection with the yorktown acquisition  giant assumed certain of bp s obligations under an administrative order issued in by the epa under the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  for which giant maintains it has an indemnity right against bp 
in august  giant agreed to the terms of the final administrative consent order pursuant to which giant will implement a clean up plan for the refinery 
following the acquisition of giant  we are in the process of finalizing the details of the clean up plan with the epa 
we currently estimate that expenditures associated with the epa order are approximately million up to million of which we believe is subject to reimbursement by bp 
the discounted value of this liability assumed from giant on may   was million 
we incurred million in related to the epa order and believe that approximately million will be incurred between and the remainder will be spent over a year period following construction 
these estimates assume that epa will agree with the design and specifications of our clean up plan 
these estimates also could change as a result of factors such as changes in costs of labor and materials 
during  in response to the first claim requesting reimbursement from bp  we received a letter from bp disputing indemnification for these costs 
we are pursuing indemnification from bp 
to reflect the uncertainty of the outcome  however  we have accrued a reserve of million for this project as of december  as part of the consent order clean up plan  a portion of the facility s underground sewer system will be cleaned  inspected  and repaired as needed 
this sewer work is scheduled to begin during the construction of the corrective action management unit and related remediation work and is included in the associated cost estimate 
we anticipate that construction of the corrective action management unit and related remediation work  which includes rerouting a section of the sewer system to allow construction  as well as sewer system inspection and repair  will be completed approximately four to five years after the epa approves the clean up plan and authorizes its implementation 
yorktown amended consent decree 
in may  a giant subsidiary company acquired the yorktown refinery and assumed certain environmental obligations including responsibilities under a consent decree among various parties covering many locations  or the consent decree  entered in august under the epa initiative 
parties to the consent decree include the united states  bp exploration and oil co  amoco oil company  and atlantic richfield company 
as applicable to the yorktown refinery  the consent decree required  among other things  a reduction of nitrous oxides  sulfur dioxide  and particulate matter emissions and upgrades to the refinery s leak detection and repair program 
we do not expect implementation of the consent decree requirements will result in any soil or groundwater remediation or clean up requirements 
pursuant to the consent decree and prior to may   giant had installed a new sour water stripper and sulfur recovery unit with a tail gas treating unit and an electrostatic precipitator  or esp  on the fluid catalytic cracking unit  or fccu  and had begun using sulfur dioxide emissions reducing catalyst additives in the fccu 
as of december   we had expended million controlling nox emissions from one heater 
we estimate additional capital expenditures of approximately million to complete implementation of the capital expenditures required by the consent decree 
this amount has been included in our estimated capital expenditures for regulatory projects 
we do not expect completing the requirements of the consent decree to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations or that any penalties or increased operating costs related to the epa initiative will be material 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  capital spending  elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents four corners refineries four corners consent agreements 
in july  as part of the epa initiative  giant reached an administrative settlement with new mexico environmental department  or nmed  and the epa in the form of consent agreements that resolved certain alleged violations of air quality regulations at the gallup and bloomfield refineries in the four corners area of new mexico 
the nmed agreement requires that both four corners refineries implement air pollution controls between and to reduce air emissions including emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides 
we do not expect implementation of the nmed agreement requirements will result in any soil or groundwater remediation or clean up requirements 
based on current information  we have estimated the total capital expenditures that may be required pursuant to the nmed agreement would be approximately to million and will occur from to these capital expenditures would primarily be for installation of emission controls on the fccus and heaters and boilers  and for reducing sulfur in fuel gas to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the refineries 
prior to may   giant had completed a sulfur recovery system at the gallup refinery 
modifications to the sulfur recovery systems at the gallup refinery will be installed in early to improve performance of the units at a cost of approximately million 
total capital expenditures could increase if modifications to the sulfur recovery units are unsuccessful 
based on current information  we do not expect the implementation of the nmed settlements to have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  or results of operations or that any penalties or increased operating costs related to the epa initiative will be material 
bloomfield nmed remediation order 
in july  we received a final administrative compliance order from nmed alleging that releases of contaminants and hazardous substances that have occurred at the bloomfield refinery over the course of its operation prior to june   have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination 
among other things  the final order requires us to investigate and determine the nature and extent of such releases of contaminants and hazardous substances  perform interim remediation measures  or continue interim measures already begun  to mitigate any potential threats to human health or the environment from such releases  identify and evaluate alternatives for corrective measures to clean up any contaminants and hazardous substances released at the refinery and prevent or mitigate their migration at or from the site  implement any corrective measures that may be approved by nmed  develop investigation work plans over a period of approximately four years  and implement corrective measures pursuant to the investigation 
the final order recognizes that prior work satisfactorily completed may fulfill some of the foregoing requirements 
in that regard  we have already put in place some remediation measures with the approval of nmed or new mexico oil conservation division  or ocd 
based on current information  we have prepared an initial cost estimate of million for implementing the final order 
accordingly  we have recorded the liability relating to the final order implementation costs 
bloomfield epa compliance order 
in october  giant received an administrative compliance order from the epa in connection with a compliance evaluation inspection at the bloomfield refinery in and a follow up inspection in early giant sent waste water from the refinery s process units through an oil water separator  a series of aeration ponds that continue the treatment and processing of oily water  and a series of evaporation ponds  before the water was injected into a permitted deep well 
the epa alleged that benzene levels in the aeration ponds exceed permissible rcra levels 
the epa also alleged that giant failed to make a rcra hazardous waste determination in connection with waste water going into the aeration ponds 
in may  giant reached a settlement with epa in the form of a consent agreement and paid a civil penalty 
the settlement requires that giant make equipment modifications to reduce benzene levels in the waste water coming from the refinery s process units 
the project was completed in october and we incurred capital expenditures of million on this project 
since the settlement does not require any cleanup activities  we have not recorded an environmental liability for this matter 
reduction of sulfur content in light fuels the epa has adopted regulations under the clean air act that requires significant reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline and diesel fuel 
these regulations required most refineries to begin reducing sulfur content in gasoline to parts per million  or ppm  in january   with full compliance by january   and require reductions in sulfur content in diesel to ppm beginning in june   with full compliance by january  
table of contents however  we applied for and received small refiner status under the epa low sulfur gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel programs 
a small refiner is one having less than  employees and an average crude oil capacity of less than  bpd 
as a small refiner  we would not have had to meet the ppm gasoline standard until january since we had fully implemented the new on road diesel sulfur content standard of ppm by june  as a result of the giant acquisition  we no longer qualify as a small refiner 
the rules provide for a period of at least months to comply with the ppm gasoline standard after losing small refiner status due to a merger or acquisition 
we anticipate meeting the standard in the required time 
our compliance with the new reduced sulfur standards in gasoline will require additional capital expenditures of approximately million through our capital cost estimate for gasoline sulfur compliance has increased significantly from previous estimate due to additional work required for the fluid catalytic cracker  or fcc  gasoline hydrotreater  development and inclusion of costs related to the lsr hydrotreating unit  additional work required for offsites and infrastructure modifications needed to support gasoline sulfur compliance  project cost escalation and related cost contingencies 
for additional details  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital spending 
in addition to the benefits described above for being classified as a small refiner under the epa rules  we qualify for designation as a small refiner under tax legislation 
this legislation allows us to immediately deduct up to of the ultra low sulfur diesel compliance costs when incurred for tax purposes 
furthermore  the law allows the remaining of ultra low sulfur diesel compliance costs to be recovered as tax credits with the commencement of ultra low sulfur diesel manufacturing 
the loss of our small refiner status upon the completion of the giant acquisition did not impact this accelerated deduction tax treatment 
environmental remediation certain environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up spills  releases and discharge of petroleum or hazardous substances  even if these owners or operators did not know of and were not responsible for such spills  releases and discharges 
these environmental laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances  regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person 
the groundwater and certain solid waste management units and other areas at and adjacent to our refinery have been impacted by prior spills  releases and discharges of petroleum or hazardous substances and are currently undergoing remediation by us and chevron pursuant to certain agreed administrative orders with the texas commission on environmental quality  or tceq 
chevron retained liability for  and control of  certain environmental liabilities and remediation activities that existed  or arise out of events occurring  prior to our acquisition of the north refinery assets 
for example  chevron retained responsibility to remediate their solid waste management units in accordance with its resource conservation recovery act permit and retained liability for  and control of  certain groundwater remediation responsibilities 
we currently believe that we have adequate insurance to cover the costs of the remaining activities  however  to the extent that these indemnity and insurance obligations are not fulfilled  we may incur significant costs in connection with these clean ups 
furthermore  in the future we may be required to remediate pollution conditions at the refinery not addressed by the agreed administrative orders or to remediate newly discovered pollution conditions 
in addition to clean up costs  we may face liability for personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances that we may have manufactured  used  handled or disposed of or that are located at or released from our refinery or otherwise related to our current or former operations 
we may also face liability for personal injury  property damage  natural resource damage or for clean up costs for the alleged migration of petroleum or hazardous substances from our refinery to adjacent and other nearby properties 
employees as of february   we employed  people  of whom at the el paso refinery and at the yorktown refinery were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the collective bargaining agreements both expire in in addition  employees at the bloomfield refinery and the gallup refinery recently voted to form unions during we have not yet finalized negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements with these employees 
we may not be able to negotiate these agreements or renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms  or at all 
a failure to do so may increase our costs 
in addition  our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage in the future  and any such work stoppage could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

risk factors an investment in our common shares involves risk 
the acquisition of giant has significantly changed the nature and scope of our operations 
as a result  the risks we face have changed as well 
in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec  you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business 
the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks that are not yet known to us or that we currently think are immaterial also could impair our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
if any of the risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common shares could decline 
the price volatility of crude oil  other feedstocks  refined products  and fuel and utility services has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 
our earnings and cash flows from operations depend on the margin above fixed and variable expenses including the cost of refinery feedstocks  such as crude oil at which we are able to sell refined products 
refining margins historically have been volatile  and are likely to continue to be volatile  as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  other feedstocks  refined products  and fuel and utility services 
in particular  our refining margins were substantially lower in the fourth quarter of as compared to the first three quarters of the year due to substantial increases in feedstock costs and lower increases in gasoline prices 
in recent years  the prices of crude oil  other feedstocks and refined products have fluctuated substantially 
our average cost per barrel of crude oil for was  compared to for  and for prices of crude oil  other feedstocks and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the supply of and demand for crude oil  other feedstocks  gasoline and other refined products 
such supply and demand are affected by  among other things changes in global and local economic conditions  demand for crude oil and refined products  especially in the us  china and india  worldwide political conditions  particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the middle east  west africa and latin america  the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products and the level of crude oil  feedstocks and refined products imported into the us  which can be impacted by accidents  interruptions in transportation  inclement weather or other events affecting producers and suppliers  us government regulations  utilization rates of us refineries  
table of contents changes in fuel specifications required by environmental and other laws  particularly with respect to oxygenates and sulfur content  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to maintain oil price and production controls  development and marketing of alternative and competing fuels  pricing and other actions taken by competitors that impact the market  product pipeline capacity  including the longhorn pipeline  as well as kinder morgan s expansion completed in of its east line  both of which could increase supply in certain of our service areas and therefore reduce our margins  accidents  interruptions in transportation  inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our plants  machinery or equipment  or those of our suppliers or customers  and local factors  including market conditions  weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our service areas 
volatility has had  and may continue to further have  a negative effect on our results of operations to the extent that the margin between refined product prices and feedstock prices narrows further  as was the case at the end of the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories 
crude oil and refined products are commodities 
as a result  we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories 
because our inventory of crude oil and refined product is valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation methodology  if the market value of our inventory were to decline to an amount less than our lifo cost  we would record a write down of inventory and a non cash charge to cost of products sold 
the valuing of the giant inventory required to be done as a result of the acquisition of giant may make this more likely to occur in the future 
in addition  the volatility in costs of fuel  principally natural gas  and other utility services  principally electricity  used by our refineries affects operating costs 
fuel and utility prices have been  and will continue to be  affected by factors outside our control  such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
typically  electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices 
future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of giant industries  inc giant suffered three fires at its refineries in the year prior to the acquisition  and as a result  the insurance costs for these refineries increased and the terms of the insurance coverage have been adversely affected 
these refineries also suffered increased costs associated with several major capital projects 
in addition to the risks ordinarily associated with a significant acquisition  we are exposed to risks arising from these events and other operational risks that may affect these legacy giant assets differently than they currently affect us 
although we expect to realize strategic  operational and financial benefits as a result of the giant acquisition  we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved 
in particular  the success of the giant acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated refinery efficiencies and cost savings from assuming control of giant s businesses 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and cost savings 
in addition  we will face certain challenges as we integrate giant s operations into our business 
in particular  the giant acquisition has significantly expanded our geographic scope  the types of business in which we are engaged  the number of our employees and the number of refineries we operate  thereby presenting us with significant challenges as we work to manage the substantial increases in scale resulting from the acquisition 
we must integrate a large number of systems  both operational and administrative 
delays in this process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  expenses  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  events outside of our control  including changes in state and federal regulation and laws as well as economic trends  also could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the giant acquisition 
we can give no assurance that our acquisition of giant will perform in accordance with our expectations 
we can give no assurance that our expectations with regards to integration and synergies will materialize 
our failure to successfully integrate and operate these legacy giant assets  or to resolve any issues arising from the declaration of force majeure under the statoil contract  and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  could adversely affect our operating  performing and financial results 
see item business refining segment yorktown refinery raw material supply 

table of contents we have a limited operating history as a stand alone company  and our previous financial statements may not be indicative of future performance 
fiscal year was the first full year in which we owned and operated our integrated refinery in el paso 
in addition  we acquired giant on may  in light of our acquisition of the other half of the el paso refinery in august and giant in may  our financial statements only reflect the impact of the acquisitions since those dates and therefore make comparisons with prior periods difficult 
as a result  our limited historical financial performance makes it difficult for shareholders to evaluate our business and results of operations to date and to assess our future prospects and viability 
furthermore  our brief operating history has resulted in revenue and profitability growth rates that may not be indicative of our future results of operations 
as a result  the price of our common stock may be volatile 
if the price of crude oil increases significantly or our credit profile changes  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and limit our ability to purchase enough crude oil to operate our refineries at full capacity 
we rely in part on borrowings and letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility  increased from million in february  to purchase crude oil for our refineries 
changes in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices with us or require additional support such as letters of credit 
due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases  any imposition by our creditors of more burdensome payment terms on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers  which could hinder our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at planned rates 
in addition  if the price of crude oil increases significantly  we may not have sufficient capacity under our revolving credit facility  or sufficient cash on hand  to purchase enough crude oil to operate our refineries at planned rates 
a failure to operate our refineries at planned rates could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
the dangers inherent in our operations could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses  costs or liabilities 
any significant interruptions in the operations of any of our refineries could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in refining operations and in transporting and storing crude oil  intermediate products  and refined products 
these hazards and risks include  but are not limited to  the following natural disasters  fires  explosions  pipeline ruptures and spills  third party interference  disruption of natural gas deliveries under our interruptible natural gas delivery contract for the el paso refinery  disruptions of electricity deliveries  and mechanical failure of equipment at our refineries or third party facilities 
any of the foregoing could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions  environmental pollution  personal injury or wrongful death claims  and other damage to our properties and the properties of others 
there is also risk of mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns both in general and following unforeseen events 
furthermore  in such situations  undamaged refinery processing units may be dependent on or interact with damaged process units and  accordingly  are also subject to being shut down 
our refineries consist of many processing units  several of which have been in operation for a long time 
one or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs  or our planned turnarounds may last longer than anticipated 
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues and increase our costs during the period of time that our units are not operating 
our refining activities are conducted at our el paso refinery in texas  the yorktown refinery in virginia  and our two refineries in new mexico 
the refineries constitute a significant portion of our operating assets  and our refineries supply a significant portion of our fuel to our retail operations 
prior to our acquisition of giant  there was one fire incident at the yorktown refinery and two fire incidents at the gallup refinery in late because of the significance to us of our refining operations  the occurrence of any of the events described above could significantly disrupt our production and 
table of contents distribution of refined products  and any sustained disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to run our four corners refineries at increased rates 
in  giant purchased an inactive pipeline running from southwest new mexico to northwest new mexico 
the pipeline has been upgraded to transport crude oil from southeast new mexico to the four corners region 
while this additional supply of crude oil was intended to allow us to run our four corners refineries at increased rates  we may not be able to do so 
these refineries had been running at less than full capacity for a number of years and there is no assurance that the refinery units will be able to run at increased rates 
we could experience business interruptions caused by pipeline shutdown 
our el paso refinery  which is our largest refinery  is dependent on a mile pipeline owned by kinder morgan  for the delivery of all of its crude oil 
because our crude oil refining capacity at the el paso refinery is approaching the delivery capacity of the pipeline  our ability to offset lost production due to disruptions in supply with increased future production is limited due to this crude oil supply constraint 
in addition  we will be unable to take advantage of further expansion of the el paso refinery s production without securing additional crude oil supplies or pipeline expansion 
we also deliver a substantial percentage of the refined products produced at the el paso refinery through three principal product pipelines 
any extended  non excused downtime of our el paso refinery could cause us to lose line space on these refined products pipelines if we cannot otherwise utilize our pipeline allocations 
we could experience an interruption of supply or delivery  or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market  if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents  governmental regulation  terrorism  other third party action  or any other events beyond our control 
a prolonged inability to receive crude oil or transport refined products on pipelines that we currently utilize could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also have a pipeline system that delivers crude oil to our four corners refineries and a pipeline that delivers natural gas liquids to our gallup refinery 
the four corners refineries are dependent on the crude oil pipeline system for the delivery of the crude oil necessary to run the refineries at increased rates 
if the operation of the pipeline is disrupted because of accidents  governmental regulation  terrorism  other third party action  or any other events beyond our control  we would not receive the crude oil necessary to run the refineries at increased rates 
a prolonged inability to transport crude oil on the pipeline system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain rights of way for our crude oil pipeline system must be renewed periodically  including some that have expired  which are in the process of renewal  and others that expire in the next few years 
we expect that substantial lead time will be required to negotiate and complete renewal of these rights of way and that the costs of renewal for certain of the rights of way may be significant 
our inability to successfully renew these rights of way would negatively impact our ability to use the crude oil pipeline systems  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  including hurricanes  could interrupt the supply of some of our feedstocks 
crude oil supplies for the el paso refinery come from the permian basin in texas and new mexico and therefore are generally not subject to interruption from severe weather  such as hurricanes 
we  however  obtain certain of our feedstocks for the el paso refinery  such as alkylate  and some refined products we purchase for resale  by pipeline from gulf coast refineries 
we also rely on transported feedstocks to produce a portion of our phoenix clean burning gasoline  or cbg  and other refined products 
in addition  we currently depend on rail shipments of sulfuric acid to and from acid regeneration facilities in louisiana to conduct our el paso refining operations 
these gulf coast refineries and acid regeneration facilities are subject to damage or production interruption from hurricanes or other severe weather 
if our supply of feedstocks or sulfuric acid is interrupted for the el paso refinery  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
our yorktown refinery is located on land that lies along the york river in york county  virginia 
it is situated adjacent to its own deep water port on the york river 
all of the crude oil used by the refinery is delivered by crude oil tankers and most of the finished products sold by the refinery are shipped out by barge  with the remaining amount shipped out by truck or rail 
as a result of its location  the refinery is subject to damage or interruption of operations and deliveries of both crude oil and finished products from hurricanes or other severe weather 
a prolonged interruption of operations or deliveries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents competition in the refining and marketing industry is intense  and an increase in competition in the areas in which we sell our refined products could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies  including certain multinational oil companies 
because of their geographic diversity  larger and more complex refineries  integrated operations and greater resources  some of our competitors may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions  to compete on the basis of price  to obtain crude oil in times of shortage and to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of the refining industry 
in addition  based on the strong fundamentals for the global refining industry  capital investments for refinery expansions and new refineries in international markets have increased  which may result in greater us imports of refined products 
we are not engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks 
certain of our competitors  however  obtain a portion of their feedstocks from company owned production 
competitors that have their own production are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing  and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages 
in addition  we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors  both within and outside of our industry  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the longhorn refined products pipeline  which was completed in late  runs approximately miles from the houston area of the gulf coast to el paso and has an estimated maximum capacity of  bpd 
this pipeline provides gulf coast refiners and other shippers with improved access to west texas and new mexico 
in addition  kinder morgan completed and placed into service its east line expansion that increases pipeline capacity from el paso to tucson and phoenix  arizona 
the expansion increases capacity on the east line to over  bpd 
any additional or modified supply provided by these pipelines could lower prices and increase price volatility in areas that we serve and could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
portions of our operations in the areas we operate may be impacted by competitors plans  as well as plans of our own  for expansion projects and refinery improvements that could increase the production of refined products in the southwest region 
in addition  we anticipate that lower quality crude oils  which are typically less expensive to acquire  can and will be processed by our competitors as a result of refinery improvements 
these developments could result in increased competition in the areas in which we operate 
we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental and health and safety regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of petroleum and hazardous substances  the emission and discharge of materials into the environment  waste management  characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may be subject to administrative  civil and criminal proceedings by governmental authorities  as well as civil proceedings by environmental groups and other entities and individuals 
a failure to comply  and any related proceedings  including lawsuits  could result in significant costs and liabilities  penalties  judgments against us or governmental or court orders that could alter  limit or stop our operations 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations  including new regulations relating to alternative energy sources and the risk of global climate change  new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  increased governmental enforcement or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures 
there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level in the united states with respect to greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide and such regulation could result in the creation of substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances 
many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent  and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time 
we are not able to predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations or changes in the ways that such laws or regulations are administered  interpreted or enforced 
the requirements to be met  as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements  continue to develop and change 
to the extent that the costs associated with meeting any of these requirements are substantial and not adequately provided for  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  has issued rules pursuant to the clean air act that require refiners to reduce the sulfur content of gasoline and highway diesel fuel by various specified dates 
we are incurring substantial costs to comply with the epa s low sulfur rules 
the yorktown refinery is subject to a compliance plan agreed to by the epa that modified the timetable for the yorktown and el paso refineries to comply with the rules and requires the yorktown refinery to produce specified volumes of compliant product by various dates 
failure to produce these specified volumes 
table of contents required by the yorktown compliance plan has resulted  and could result in the future  in us having to purchase credits and or sell more high sulfur heating oil than otherwise would be the case 
at most times  high sulfur heating oil sells for a lower margin than ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 
failure to comply with the yorktown compliance plan could also result in the epa modifying or revoking the compliance plans or assessing penalties 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate 
if we cannot generate cash flow or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and long term capital requirements  we may not be able to comply with certain environmental standards by the current epa mandated deadlines or pursue our business strategies  in which case our operations may not perform as well as we currently expect 
we have substantial short term and long term capital needs  including those for capital expenditures that we will make to comply with the low sulfur content specifications of the tier ii gasoline standards and on and off road diesel laws and regulations 
our short term working capital needs are primarily crude oil purchase requirements  which fluctuate with the pricing and sourcing of crude oil 
we also have significant long term needs for cash  including those to support our expansion and upgrade plans  as well as for regulatory compliance 
our operations involve environmental risks that could give rise to material liabilities 
our operations  and those of prior owners or operators of our properties  have previously resulted in spills  discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances into the environment  and such spills  discharges or releases could also happen in the future 
past or future spills related to any of our operations  including our refineries  product terminals or transportation of refined products or hazardous substances from those facilities  may give rise to liability including strict liability  or liability without fault  and cleanup responsibility to governmental entities or private parties under federal  state or local environmental laws  as well as under common law 
for example  we could be held strictly liable under the comprehensive environmental responsibility  compensation and liability act  or cercla  for contamination of properties that we currently own or operate and facilities to which we transported or arranged for the transportation of wastes or by products for use  treatment  storage or disposal  without regard to fault or whether our actions were in compliance with law at the time 
our liability could also increase if other responsible parties  including prior owners or operators of our facilities  fail to complete their clean up obligations 
based on current information  we do not believe these liabilities are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  but in the event that new spills  discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances occur or are discovered or there are other changes in facts or in the level of contributions being made by other responsible parties  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances located at or released from our refineries or otherwise related to our current or former operations 
we may also face liability for personal injury  property damage  natural resource damage or for clean up costs for the alleged migration of contamination or other hazardous substances from our refineries to adjacent and other nearby properties 
we are involved in a number of mtbe lawsuits and in a hot fuel lawsuit 
lawsuits have been filed in numerous states alleging that mtbe  a blendstock used by many refiners in producing specially formulated gasoline  has contaminated water supplies 
mtbe contamination primarily results from leaking underground or aboveground storage tanks 
the suits allege mtbe contamination of water supplies owned and operated by the plaintiffs  who are generally water providers or governmental entities 
the plaintiffs assert that numerous refiners  distributors  or sellers of mtbe and or gasoline containing mtbe are responsible for the contamination 
the plaintiffs also claim that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for compensatory and punitive damages  costs  and interest 
joint and several liability means that each defendant may be liable for all of the damages even though that party was responsible for only a small part of the damages 
as a result of the acquisition of giant  certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in approximately of these mtbe lawsuits pending in virginia  connecticut  massachusetts  new hampshire  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  and new mexico 
due to giant s historical operations in new mexico  including retail sites  there is potentially greater risk in connection with the new mexico litigation than in the litigation in the eastern states where giant has only operated since and has no retail operations 
in addition  western has been named as a defendant in the lawsuit filed in new mexico 
western understands that the case has been transferred to the southern district of new york by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation and that an 
table of contents amended complaint has been filed 
western has not been served with a summons and complaint  nor has western made an appearance in this litigation 
western also has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the state of new jersey related to mtbe 
western has never done business in new jersey and has never sold any products in that state or that could have reached that state 
because potentially applicable factual and legal issues have not been resolved  we have yet to determine if a liability is probable and we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any loss associated with these matters 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability for these lawsuits 
in march  a class action lawsuit was filed in new mexico naming numerous retail suppliers of motor fuel as defendants  including certain of our subsidiaries 
among other things  the lawsuit alleges that  by consciously selling gasoline at a temperature greater than fahrenheit  the defendants are depriving consumers of the full amount of energy that should be delivered when gasoline is delivered at a cooler temperature 
plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages and also seek to require the defendants to install temperature adjustment devices at the pumps 
similar class action lawsuits have been filed in several other jurisdictions  and have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in a single multi district litigation 
because potentially applicable factual and legal issues have not been resolved  we have yet to determine if a liability is probable and if it can be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability for this lawsuit 
we could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations 
our operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations  including environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
these authorizations and permits are subject to revocation  renewal or modification and can require operational changes  which may involve significant costs  to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and or health and safety 
a violation of these authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines  criminal sanctions  permit revocations  injunctions and or refinery shutdowns 
in addition  major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or expensive upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was  million and our stockholders equity was million 
we currently have an million revolving credit facility increased from million in february 
as of december   we had net availability under this facility of million due to million in outstanding letters of credit and direct borrowings of million 
if the increase of our revolving line of credit had been in place at december   our availability would have been increased to million 
our level of debt may have important consequences to you 
among other things  it may limit our ability to use our cash flow  or obtain additional financing  for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  restrict our ability to pay dividends  require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and  to the extent of our outstanding debt under our floating rate debt facilities  the impact of increases in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if we cannot do so  due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise  we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets  or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  our ability to incur additional debt will be restricted under the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility and term loan facility 

table of contents covenants and events of default in our debt instruments could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity 
our revolving credit facility and term loan facility contain covenants and events of default that may limit our financial flexibility and ability to undertake certain types of transactions 
for instance  we are subject to negative covenants that restrict our activities  including restrictions on creating liens  engaging in mergers  consolidations and sales of assets  incurring additional indebtedness  providing guarantees  engaging in different businesses  making investments  making certain dividend  debt and other restricted payments  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  and entering into certain contractual obligations 
we are also subject to financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy other financial tests 
if we fail to satisfy the covenants set forth in either facility or another event of default occurs under either facility  the maturity of the loans could be accelerated or we could be prohibited from borrowing for our working capital needs and issuing letters of credit 
if the loans are accelerated and we do not have sufficient cash on hand to pay all amounts due  we could be required to sell assets  to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  or to obtain additional financing 
refinancing may not be possible and additional financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot borrow or issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  we would need to seek additional financing  if available  or curtail our operations 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is limited by contractual restrictions and cash generated by operations 
we currently pay a quarterly dividend 
we are a holding company  however  and all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
consequently  we will rely on dividends or advances from our subsidiaries to fund our dividends 
the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and our ability to receive distributions from those entities are subject to applicable local law and other restrictions including  but not limited to  restrictions in our revolving credit facility and term loan facility  including minimum operating cash and net worth requirements 
such laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to us  which would restrict our ability to pay dividends 
in addition  our payment of dividends will depend upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows 
our board of directors will review our dividend policy periodically in light of the factors referred to above  and we cannot assure you of the amount of dividends  if any  that may be paid in the future 
changes to the current tax laws could result in the imposition of entity level state taxation on one of our operating subsidiaries  which would result in a reduction in our anticipated cash flow 
one of our operating subsidiaries is organized as a partnership 
a partnership generally is not subject to entity level state franchise tax in the jurisdictions in which it is organized or operates 
current laws may change  however  subjecting our partnership operating subsidiary to entity level state taxation 
for example  in may  the state of texas enacted the texas margins tax  or tmt  a new business tax that is imposed on our gross margin to replace the state s current franchise tax 
our insurance policies do not cover all losses  costs or liabilities that we may experience 
our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses  costs or liabilities 
due to the fires experienced at the giant refineries in and  the cost of insurance coverage in for the yorktown and four corners refineries will be higher than the cost of insurance for the el paso refinery 
in addition to the higher costs  the deductibles for such coverage are higher and the waiting periods for business interruption coverage are longer 
we could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of our existing insurance coverage 
our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control 
in addition  if we experience any more insurable events  our annual premiums could increase further 
table of contents or insurance may not be available at all 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or the loss of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies 
our business strategies include the implementation of several capital expenditure projects designed to increase the productivity and profitability of our refineries 
many factors beyond our control may prevent or hinder our implementation of some or all of our planned capital expenditure projects or lead to cost overruns  including new or more expensive obligations to comply with environmental regulations  a downturn in refining margins  technical or mechanical problems  lack of available capital and other factors 
failure to successfully implement these profit enhancing strategies on a timely basis or at all may adversely affect our business prospects and competitive position in the industry 
in addition  a component of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary assets in order to increase earnings and cash flow 
our ability to do so will be dependent upon several factors  including our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates  consummate acquisitions on favorable terms  successfully integrate acquired assets  obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth  and many other factors beyond our control 
risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to diversion of management time and attention from our existing business  challenges in managing the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of operations  difficulties in integrating the financial  technological and management standards  processes  procedures and controls of an acquired business with those of our existing operations  liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance  greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results  difficulties in achieving anticipated operational improvements  incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets  and issuance of additional equity  which could result in further dilution of the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
we may not be successful in acquiring additional assets  and any acquisitions that we do consummate may not produce the anticipated benefits or may have adverse effects on our business and operating results 
if we lose any of our key personnel  our ability to manage our business and continue our growth could be negatively impacted 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  executive vice president  executive vice president refining  chief financial officer  senior vice president legal  chief accounting officer and treasurer 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any member of our senior management team 
the loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us 
we face competition for these professionals from our competitors  our customers  and other companies operating in our industry 
to the extent that the services of members of our senior management team would be unavailable to us for any reason  we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company 
we may not be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms  or at all 
a substantial portion of our refining workforce is unionized  and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations 
as of february   we employed  people  of whom at the el paso refinery and at the yorktown refinery were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the collective bargaining agreements both expire in in addition  employees at the bloomfield refinery and the gallup refinery recently voted to form unions during we have not yet finalized negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements with these employees 
we may not be able to negotiate these agreements or renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms  or at all 
a failure to do so may increase our costs 
in addition  our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage in the future  and any such work stoppage could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents terrorist attacks  threats of war or actual war may negatively affect our operations  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
terrorist attacks in the us and the war in iraq  as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them  may adversely affect our operations  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
energy related assets which could include refineries and terminals such as ours or pipelines such as the ones on which we depend for our crude oil supply and refined product distribution may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets 
a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in addition  any terrorist attack could have an adverse impact on energy prices  including prices for our crude oil and refined products  and an adverse impact on the margins from our refining and marketing operations 
in addition  disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls 
while we currently maintain some insurance that provides coverage against terrorist attacks  such insurance has become increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain 
as a result  insurance providers may not continue to offer this coverage to us on terms that we consider affordable  or at all 
our operating results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months 
in addition  oxygenate is added to the gasoline in our service areas during the winter months  thereby increasing the supply of gasoline 
this combination of decreased demand and increased supply during the winter months can lower gasoline prices 
as a result  our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
the effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by seasonality in demand for diesel fuel  which in the southwest region of the united states is generally higher in winter months as east west trucking traffic moves south to avoid winter conditions on northern routes  and heating oil in the northeast 
we will be exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we evaluated our internal controls systems excluding giant to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to audit  our internal controls over financial reporting excluding giant as of december  we performed the system and process evaluation and testing along with any necessary remediation required to comply with the management assessment requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of in addition  we are in the process of analyzing the internal controls of giant  a wholly owned subsidiary we acquired on may  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions relating to giant s internal controls or the impact of the same on our operations 
furthermore  upon completion of this process  we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable sec and public company accounting oversight board rules and regulations that remain unremediated 
we are required to report  among other things  control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal controls that  or that are reasonably likely to  materially affect internal controls over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements  and our stock price may be adversely affected as a result 
if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate  we may face restricted access to the capital markets  and our stock price may be adversely affected 
our controlling stockholders may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders in the future 
mr

jeff stevens our executive vice president and a current director  ralph schmidt our former chief operating officer and a current director and scott weaver our vice president  assistant secretary and a current director own approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
foster and the other members of this group will be able to control the election of our directors  determine our corporate and management policies and determine  without the consent of our other stockholders  the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales  and other significant corporate transactions 
so long as this group continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock  they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions  including whether to pursue or consummate potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales  and other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of mr

table of contents we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nyse rules and  as a result  will qualify for  and may rely on  exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements

mtbe litigation lawsuits have been filed in numerous states alleging that mtbe  a blendstock used by many refiners in producing specially formulated gasoline  has contaminated water supplies 
mtbe contamination primarily results from leaking underground or aboveground storage tanks 
the suits allege mtbe contamination of water supplies owned and operated by the plaintiffs  who are generally water providers or governmental entities 
the plaintiffs assert that numerous refiners  distributors  or sellers of mtbe and or gasoline containing mtbe are responsible for the contamination 
the plaintiffs also claim that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for compensatory and punitive damages  costs  and interest 
joint and several liability means that each defendant may be liable for all of the damages even though that party was responsible for only a small part of the damages 
as a result of the acquisition of giant  certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in approximately of these mtbe lawsuits pending in virginia  connecticut  massachusetts  new hampshire  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  florida  and new mexico 
due to giant s historical operations in new mexico  including retail sites  there is potentially greater risk in connection with the new mexico litigation than in the litigation in the eastern states where giant has only operated since and has no retail operations 
in addition  western has been named as a defendant in the lawsuit filed in new mexico 
western understands that the case has been transferred to the southern district of new york by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation and that an amended complaint has been filed 
western has not been served with a summons and complaint  nor has western made an appearance in this litigation 
if western is served with a summons and made an active defendant in this matter  western will vigorously defend itself 

table of contents western also has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the state of new jersey related to mtbe 
western has never done business in new jersey and has never sold any products in that state or that could have reached that state 
accordingly  western intends to vigorously defend itself 
we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits 
because potentially applicable factual and legal issues have not been resolved  we have yet to determine if a liability is probable and we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any loss associated with these matters
