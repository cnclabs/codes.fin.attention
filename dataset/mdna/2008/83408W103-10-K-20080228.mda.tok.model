critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe accounting for brand advertising and sponsored search revenues  accounting for online game revenues  accounting for wireless revenues and cost of revenues  gross versus net basis of revenue recognition  determination of functional currencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of impairment for goodwill  intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets  determination of share based compensation expense  and valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues advertising revenues include revenue from brand advertising and sponsored search services  after deducting agent rebates and applicable business tax 
no revenues from advertising for advertising barter transactions were recognized 
brand advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to brand advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements on various website channels and in different formats  including but not limited to banners  
table of contents links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectibility is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectibility is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon payment from the customers 
sponsorship contracts may include services similar to those in our brand advertising contracts  are generally for larger dollar amounts and for a longer period of time  may allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our websites  may include brand affiliation services and or a larger volume of services  and may require some exclusivity or premiere placements 
sponsorship advertisement revenues are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  provided we are meeting our obligations under the contract 
pursuant to sponsored search contracts  which are normally for relatively small dollar amounts and are with small and medium sized enterprises  sponsored search services mainly include priority placements in our search directory and pay for click services consisting of displaying the text based links of our advertisers on our websites and our website alliance network 
we normally provide priority placements services for a fixed fee over the service period of the contracts 
revenues on priority placements are normally recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period provided we are meeting our obligation under the contract 
pay for click services of displaying the text based links to our advertisers websites are charged on a cost per click basis  so that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on the displayed link 
the priority of the display of text based links is based on the bidding price of different advertisers 
revenues from the pay for click services are recognized as the users click on the links 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our advertising revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
non advertising revenues non advertising revenues include revenues principally from online game and wireless services 
online game revenues are collected through sale of our prepaid cards  which we sell in both virtual and physical form  to third party distributors and retailers 
prior to december  we operated our mmorpg games under a time based model 
under this model  the proceeds from sale of prepaid cards from distributors or retailers are deferred when received and revenue is recognized based upon the actual usage of time units by the end users 
in december  we changed the revenue model from time based to item based 
under the new item based model  players play a game on a free of charge basis and with the ability to purchase in game premium features 
proceeds from sale of prepaid cards are deferred when received and revenue is recognized over the estimated lives of the premium features purchased or as the premium features are consumed 
while we have adopted the new item based model for our online games for a relatively short operation history  we considered the average period that players typically play our games and other player behavior patterns to arrive at our best estimates for the lives of these in game features 
however  if different assumptions were used and resulted in a different estimate of the average period  it may impact the timing that we record our revenues 
wireless revenues are derived from providing sms  rbt  wap  mms and ivr  mainly consisting of news  weather forecast  chatting  entertainment information  ring tones  and logo downloads and various other mobile related products provided to mobile phone users 
wireless service fees are charged on a monthly or per message download basis 
wireless revenues and cost of revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided no significant obligations remain 
we rely on mobile network operators in china to bill mobile phone users for wireless service fees 
in order to meet ownership requirements under prc law which restrict or prohibit wholly foreign owned enterprises from providing internet information and value added telecommunication services such as wireless  we rely on sohu internet and goodfeel to contract with the mobile network operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  sohu internet or goodfeel receives statements from each of the operators confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering monthly statements  each operator remits the wireless service fees  net of its service fees  for the month to sohu internet or goodfeel 
in order to recognize revenue and be paid for services provided  we rely on billing confirmations from the mobile network operators as to the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
we are unable to collect certain wireless services fees from an operator in certain circumstances due to technical issues with the operator s network 
this is referred to as the failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
recently  the time lag in receiving monthly statements from one of the mobile network operators has increased 
at the end of each reporting period  where an operator has not provided sohu internet or goodfeel with the monthly statements for any month confirming the amount of wireless service charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users for the month  we  using information generated from our own internal system and historical data  make estimates of the failure rate and collectable wireless service fees and accrues revenue accordingly 
the quarterly historical differences in our estimated revenue which was recorded in the financial statements compared to the actual revenue have ranged from an underestimation of  gross margin underestimate of  to an overestimation of  gross margin overestimate of  since when wireless revenues began representing a significant portion of our total revenues 
we believe we have the ability to make a reasonable 
table of contents estimate 
however  differences between the actual failure rate and bad debt rate per an operator s statement and our internal estimates could result in material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue and cost of non advertising revenue for any period 
for the three months ended december   of our estimated wireless revenues were confirmed by the monthly statements received from the mobile network operators 
our management must determine whether to record our wireless revenues using the gross or net method of reporting 
determining whether revenue should be reported gross or net is based on an assessment of various factors  principally whether we are acting as the principal in offering services to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent in the transaction 
to the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction  we report as revenue the payments received on a gross basis  and reports as costs of revenue the amounts attributable to services provided by mobile network operators and other vendors 
to the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction  we report on a net basis reporting as revenue the payments received less commission and other payments to third parties 
the determination of whether we are serving as principal or agent in a transaction is judgmental in nature and based on an evaluation of the terms of an arrangement 
based on our assessment  the majority of our wireless revenues are recorded on a gross basis 
we have primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the wireless services 
the content and nature of the wireless services are designed and developed by us either independently or with third parties and originate from our websites  our links located on third parties websites  or one of our dedicated phone numbers 
the mobile network operators that we contract with to deliver these services to the end customers are not involved in the design or development of the services that are provided by us 
the end customer purchases the wireless content  community access or value added services  such as news  weather forecast  chatting  entertainment information  ring tones  and logo downloads and various other mobile related products provided to mobile phone users 
the end customer receives identical services from us regardless of which mobile network operator is used to deliver the message 
in addition  we provide customer services to the end customers directly and we could be requested by the mobile network operators to assume the credit risk if the operators are not able to collect fees from the end customers 
we have determined that in addition to the indicators of gross reporting  there are also certain indicators of net reporting  including the fact that the mobile network operators set maximum prices that we can charge and that the mobile network operators also have the right to set requirements and procedures associated with using their platform 
however  we have determined that the gross revenue reporting indicators are stronger  because we are the primary obligor  adds value to the products  has inventory risk related to content and products  and has reasonable pricing latitude 
to the extent revenues are recorded gross  any commissions or other payments to third parties are recorded as costs or expenses so that the net amount gross revenues  less costs and expenses flows through to operating income 
accordingly  the impact on operating income is the same whether we record the revenue on a gross or net basis 
functional currency our functional currency is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries and vies in china is rmb 
an entity s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates  normally  that is the currency of the environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash 
management s judgment is essential in determination of the functional currency by assessing various indicators  such as cash flows  sales price and market  expenses  financing and inter company transactions and arrangements 
assets and liabilities of the china subsidiaries and vies are translated into us dollar  our reporting currency  at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
foreign currency translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period but are accumulated in a separate component of consolidated equity on the balance sheet 
the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment as of december  and december  was a gain of million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of sohu s customers or mobile network operators were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  or the mobile network operators requested that we assume additional bad debts as a result of the operators inability to collect fees from end customers  additional allowance might be required 
impairment on long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying value 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill 
table of contents to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we did not believe that any event or change of circumstances had occurred that would result in material impairment losses in goodwill 
in respect of our intangible assets  which mainly comprise domain names  trademarks  customer lists and computer software purchased from unrelated third parties  we amortize the costs over their expected future economic lives 
fixed assets comprise office buildings  investment properties  computer equipment and hardware  office furniture  vehicles and leasehold improvements  and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets on a straight line basis 
other assets mainly include prepaid content fees and rental deposits 
we amortize the content fees over the terms of the contracts 
management s judgment is required in the assessment of the economic lives of intangible assets and useful lives of the fixed assets and other assets 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management which is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
an impairment charge would be recorded if we determined that the carrying value of intangible assets  fixed assets or other assets may not be recoverable 
our estimates of future cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
as of december   we were not aware of any indication of impairment of our intangible assets  fixed assets and other assets 
share based compensation effective from january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options and restricted stock units  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values 
as of january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
the fair value of the options granted before january  is determined based on the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with the valuation techniques utilized when we prepared pro forma information under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation or sfas 
restricted stock units are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
fair value of the share based awards is recognized as share based compensation cost over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures on an accelerated basis under sfas r 
the determination of the fair value of share based awards and related share based compensation expense requires input of subjective assumptions  including but not limited to the valuation model adopted  risk free interest rates  expected life of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and expected forfeiture rate 
the selection of an appropriate valuation technique or model depends on the substantive characteristics of the instrument being valued 
risk free interest rates are decided based on the yield to maturity of us government bonds as at respective dates of grant of options 
expected life is the number of years that we estimate  based primarily on the history  using plain vanilla method  that options will be outstanding prior to settlement 
volatility is measured using historical daily price changes of our stock over the respective expected life of the option 
forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture pattern and adjusted in accordance with our expectation for the future 
our input assumptions were based on historical experience  with consideration to developing expectations about the future 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards and related share based compensation represent management s best estimations  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change or we utilize different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different for any period 
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets we estimate income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate for each period presented  including estimating current tax exposure as well as assessing realizable deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
as of december   the majority of our deferred tax assets are related to net operating losses that would apply to united states income taxes 
as substantially all of our income is earned in china  and we do not intend in the foreseeable future to repatriate this income to the united states where it would be taxable  it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating losses will not be realized 
the remaining deferred tax assets are related to china based subsidiaries and vies  resulting from net operating losses and temporary differences between accounting and tax bases 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if events were to occur in the future that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net 
table of contents amount  an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax assets that would increase income for the period when those events occurred 
if events were to occur in the future that would require us to realize less of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment would be made to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that would decrease income for the period when those events occurred 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  in order to focus on our core business of online advertising  on june   we discontinued our unprofitable e commerce business 
as a result of the discontinuation of this business  the e commerce business is accounted for as a discontinued operation

the corporate income tax law provides a five year transitional period for those entities established before march   which enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than under the previous income tax laws and rules  to gradually change their rates to 
in addition  the corporate income tax law provides grandfather treatment for companies qualified as new technology enterprises under the previous income tax laws and rules and established before march  if they continue in the period after january  to meet the criteria for new technology enterprises under the previous income tax laws and rules 
the grandfather provision allows these enterprises to continue to enjoy their unexpired tax holiday under the previous income tax laws and rules 
the corporate income tax law also imposes a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside china  which were exempted under the previous income tax laws and rules 
a lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland china and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company 
holding companies in hong kong  for example  will be subject to a rate 
most of our china based subsidiaries  sohu era  sohu media  sohu software  sogou technology  gomap software and amazgame age are invested by immediate foreign holding companies in hong kong  except for sogou technology 
all of these foreign invested enterprises will be subject to the withholding tax on january  since we intend to reinvest our earnings to further expand our businesses in mainland china  our foreign invested enterprises do not intend to declare dividends to their immediate foreign holding companies in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  as of december   we have not recorded any withholding tax on the retained earnings of our foreign invested enterprises in china 
currently  there are divergent views on how the corporate income tax law will be implemented 
the company s ultimate applicable effective tax rate in and beyond will depend on many factors  including but not limited to whether certain of its legal entities will obtain an approval of their new technology enterprise status under the corporate income tax law  whether they can continue to enjoy the unexpired tax holidays and how the withholding tax on dividends will be applied 
if any of sohu era  sohu media  sogou technology  amazgame age  sohu internet  sogou information and gamease age cannot obtain an approval on their new technology enterprise status under the corporate income tax law and or cannot continue to enjoy the unexpired tax holidays or if the withholding tax on dividends is applied in a manner different from our understanding  our effective tax rate will be increased significantly 
income earned in the united states  where sohu 
com inc is incorporated  is subject to taxation at or 
for the foreseeable future  we anticipate the major source of income earned in the united states and subject to united states taxation to be interest income 
if dividends are paid by our china or other non us subsidiaries to sohu 
com inc  the dividends would be taxed at sohu 
com inc 
s rate of taxation  which is or as reduced by any applicable deemed paid foreign tax credits for foreign income taxes paid by such subsidiaries 
for the foreseeable future  we do not intend for the china or other non us subsidiaries to pay dividends to sohu

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in rmb and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollar and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk

the rmb is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
in addition  commencing on july   china reformed its exchange rate regime by changing to a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies

on may   the people s bank of china announced a policy to expand the maximum daily floating range of rmb trading prices against the us dollar in the inter bank spot foreign exchange market from to 
while the international reactions to the rmb revaluation and widening of the rmb s daily trading band have generally been positive  with the increased floating range of the rmb s value against foreign currencies  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or other foreign currencies in the long term  depending on the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

zhang and by an employee  sohu entertainment  which is owned by two of our employees  goodfeel  which is owned by two of our employees  huohu  which is owned by sohu era and by an employee  sogou information  which is owned by two of our employees  and gamease age  which is owned by two of our employees 
high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information and gamease age are used to facilitate our participation in telecommunications  internet content and certain other businesses in china where foreign ownership is either prohibited or restricted 
the agreements contain provisions that  subject to prc law  i the loans can only be repaid to us by transferring the shares of high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information or gamease age to us  ii the shares of high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information or gamease age cannot be transferred without our approval  and iii we have the right to appoint all directors and senior management personnel of high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information and gamease age 
dr 
zhang and the other employee borrowers have pledged all of their shares in high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information and gamease age as collateral for the loans and the loans bear no interest and are due on demand after november in the case of high century  after november in the case of huohu  after august  in the case of sogou information  after october in the case of goodfeel  after november  in the case of sohu entertainment  after september in the case of gamease age  or  in any case  at such time as dr 
zhang or the other employee borrowers  as the case may be  is not an employee of sohu 
sohu does not intend to request repayment of the loans as long as prc regulations prohibit it from directly investing in businesses being undertaken by the vies 
because these loans can only be repaid by the borrowers transferring the shares of the various entities  our ability to ultimately realize the effective return of the amounts advanced under these loans will depend on the profitability of high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information and gamease age which is uncertain 

table of contents furthermore  because of uncertainties associated with the prc law  ultimate enforcement of the loan agreements is uncertain 
accordingly  we may never be able to collect these loans or exercise influence over high century  sohu entertainment  goodfeel  huohu  sogou information and gamease age 
in addition  under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  issuers subject to the act are prohibited from making personal loans to their directors and executive officers 
under section  issuers are permitted to maintain the loans they made to directors and executive officers prior to the effective date of the sarbanes oxley act 
they are not permitted  however  to renew or materially modify such loans 
we believe that there is a strong argument that the loans to dr 
zhang described above are not personal loans  in view of our underlying business purpose for making the loans and the lack of a personal benefit to dr 
zhang from the loans 
in the absence of judicial interpretation  an sec rule  or an sec staff interpretation confirming our conclusion  however  we intend to treat these loans as if they were personal loans under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
accordingly  we expect that if we enter into arrangements similar to those described above in the future  any loans made under such arrangements will be made to individuals who are not our directors or executive officers 
in addition  should the existing loans to dr 
zhang  or to the entities in which he is the primary shareholder  need to be renewed or materially modified  such as if we need to advance additional funds to any of these entities  we expect that the entities  the ownership of the entities and or the loans to the entities will be restructured so that we could not be deemed to be making a loan to dr 
zhang 
the prohibitions set forth in section have not had any adverse effect on our operations to date  and we do not expect them to have any adverse effect in the future
