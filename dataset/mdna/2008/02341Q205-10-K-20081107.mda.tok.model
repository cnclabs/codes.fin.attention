strategic initiatives the company has set out a number of key initiatives in conjunction with its long term strategic plan 
the primary elements of this strategic plan include continuing growth in our two core businesses wholesale distribution and retail health food  reducing debt and maximizing the company s liquidity position  aggressively managing the company s cost structure  and capitalizing on strategic acquisition opportunities

results of operations continuing operations sales changes in sales are driven by two primary components i changes to selling prices  which are largely controlled by our product suppliers  and excise taxes imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products by various states  and ii changes in the volume of products sold to our customers  either due to a change in purchasing patterns resulting from consumer preferences or the fluctuation in the comparable number of business days in our reporting period

fiscal year versus fiscal year continuing operations sales are reported net of costs associated with sales incentives provided to retailers  totaling million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales in our wholesale distribution segment wholesale increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this change included a million decrease in cigarette sales and a net million sales increase in our tobacco  beverages  snacks  candy  grocery  health beauty products  food service  and store supplies categories other products 
significant items impacting our wholesale segment sales during fiscal included million increase in cigarette sales over fiscal due to price increases implemented by major manufacturers 
million increase in cigarette sales over fiscal due to higher excise taxes in certain states 
million decrease in cigarette sales over fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in cigarette shipment volumes 
million net increase in our other product sales category over fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher tobacco  confectionary  and food service sales  partially offset by lower sales in our beverage category 
as these increases are passed on to our customers  they resulted in a correlating increase in the cost of sales 
sales from our retail health food segment increased approximately million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal a significant portion of this sales growth was attributable to higher sales in our grocery and vitamin supplement categories  driven in part by the popularity of natural food products and more health conscious consumption patterns among consumers 
on a long term basis  we believe these trends will continue and that our retail health food segment is well positioned to capitalize on such trends 
in the near term  however  our sales growth in this segment may flatten or decrease due to deterorating economic conditions as previously discussed 
gross profit our gross profit does not include fulfillment costs and costs related to the distribution network which are included in selling  general and administrative costs  and may not be comparable to the gross profit of other entities which do include such costs 
some entities may classify such costs as a component of cost of sales 
cost of sales  a component used in determining gross profit  for our wholesale and retail segments includes the cost of products purchased from manufacturers  less incentives that we receive which are netted against such costs 
gross profit by business segment for the fiscal and september are as follows dollars in millions caption gross profit

the remaining change in gross profit is primarily attributable to lower cigarette shipment volumes  fluctuations in product mix  and lower promotional spending 
gross profit in our retail health segment increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal of this increase  approximately million related to higher sales volume and million was attributable to improved sales mix and higher overall gross profit margins 
operating expense operating expense includes selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include costs related to our sales  warehouse  delivery and administrative departments for all segments 
specifically  purchasing and receiving costs  warehousing costs and costs of picking and loading customer orders are all classified as selling  general and administrative expenses

operating expenses for fiscal increased approximately million as compared to fiscal significant items impacting operating expenses during fiscal included a million increase in fuel costs  a million increase in bad debt expense  and a million increase in compensation and employee related costs 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in professional and legal costs  a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million decrease in other operating expenses 
interest expense fiscal interest expense decreased approximately million as compared to fiscal this decrease was principally related to lower prime interest rates and lower average borrowings 
the company primarily borrows at the prime interest rate

liquidity and capital resources overview operating activities 
the company requires cash to pay operating expenses  purchase inventory  and make capital investments 
in general  the company finances its cash flow requirements with cash generated from operating activities and credit facility borrowings 
during fiscal  the company generated cash of approximately million from operating activities 
the cash generated primarily resulted from higher overall earnings and a reduction in deferred income taxes and prepaid asset balances  partially offset by higher inventory balances 
our variability in cash flows from operating activities is dependent on the timing of inventory purchases and seasonal fluctuations 
for example  periodically we have inventory buy in opportunities which offer more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we may have to hold inventory for a period longer than the payment terms 
this generates a cash outflow from operating activities which we expect to reverse in later periods 
additionally  during the warm weather months  which is our peak time of operations  we generally carry higher amounts of inventory to ensure high fill rates and maintain customer satisfaction 
investing activities 
the company used approximately million of cash during fiscal for investing activities  primarily related to capital expenditures for property and equipment 
financing activities 
the company used cash of million for financing activities during fiscal of this amount  million related to net payments on the company s credit facility  million related to principal payments on long term debt  and million related dividends on the company s common and preferred stock 
this was partially offset by million in cash received on the exercise of stock options 
cash on hand working capital 
as of september  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million 
this compares to cash on hand of million and working capital of million as of september credit agreement in july  the company amended and executed an early renewal of its million credit agreement with bank of america the facility  which was originally scheduled to mature in april the significant terms of the new facility agreement include extended maturity date through june a million revolving credit limit  plus the outstanding balance on term note a 
term note a had an outstanding balance of million at september  credit agreement continued the facility bears interest at either the bank s prime rate or at a libor based rate based on the election made by the company 
the facility provides for an additional million of credit available for inventory purchases 
these advances bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus one quarter of one percent per annum and are payable within days of each advance 
lending limits subject to accounts receivable and inventory limitations  and an unused commitment fee equal to one quarter of one percent per annum on the difference between the maximum loan limit and average monthly borrowings 
collateral including all of the company s equipment  intangibles  inventories  and accounts receivable 
provides that the company may not pay dividends on its common stock in excess of per share on an annual basis 
the facility includes a prepayment penalty equal to a predetermined percentage of the original maximum loan limit of million if the company prepays the entire facility and terminates the credit agreement before specified dates 
the prepayment penalty percentages are as follows one percent if prepayment occurs on or before june   and one half of one percent if prepayment occurs subsequent to june  but on or before june  the facility also includes quarterly debt service and cumulative earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda financial covenants 
a minimum debt service ratio of to must be maintained  as measured by the twelve month period then ended 
the cumulative minimum ebitda requirements are as follows a  for the twelve months ending september  and  b  for the three months ending december  and  c  for the six months ending march  the company was in compliance with the required debt service and minimum ebitda covenants at september the company s maximum available credit limit for the revolving portion of the facility was million at september  however  the amount available for use at any given time is subject to many factors including eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances which are evaluated on a daily basis 
at september  the outstanding balance on the revolving portion of the facility was million 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to the bank s prime rate  which was at september based on our collateral and loan limits as defined by the facility agreement  the company s excess availability under the facility at september was approximately million 
during fiscal  our peak borrowings under the facility were million and our average borrowings and average availability were and million  respectively 
our availability to borrow under the facility generally decreases as inventory and accounts receivable levels go up because of the borrowing limitations that are placed on collateralized assets 
in july  the company refinanced a real estate note payable which was collateralized by two of the company s distribution facilities bismarck  nd and quincy  il 
the note payable was originally due in april the terms of the new note payable include a fixed interest rate of with monthly principal and interest installments of  due through june the remaining principal is due at maturity in june as part of the july television events marketing  inc team litigation settlement  the company became obligated to pay  in quarterly installments through october and  in quarterly installments through october mr 
wright has personally guaranteed these payment obligations  which totaled approximately million at september amcon pays mr 
wright an annual fee equal to of the guaranteed principal in return for his personal guarantee 
this guarantee is secured by a pledge of the company s shares of chamberlin s  akin s  hnwc  and tsi 
tsi financing as previously disclosed  tsi has approximately million in related party debt obligations  which were in default during both fiscal and fiscal tsi has not obtained associated debt default waivers for these related party obligations 
at this time  the company does not anticipate the defaults will materially impact its future liquidity position 
cross default and co terminus provisions the company s owned real estate in bismarck  nd  quincy  il  and rapid city  sd  and certain warehouse equipment in the rapid city  sd warehouse is financed through term loans with marshall and ilsley bank m i  which is also a participant lender on the company s revolving line of credit 
the m i loans contain cross default provisions which cause all loans with m i to be considered in default if any one of the loans where m i is a lender  including the revolving credit facility  is in default 
in addition  the m i loans contain co terminus provisions which require all loans with m i to be paid in full if any of the loans are paid in full prior to the end of their specified terms

other the company has several capital leases for office and warehouse equipment 
at september  the outstanding balances on the capital leases totaled approximately million 
amcon has issued a letter of credit for million to its workers compensation insurance carrier as part of its self insured loss control program 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity risk the company s liquidity position is significantly influenced by its ability to obtain sufficient levels of working capital 
for our company and industry in general  customer credit risk and continuing access to bank credit primarily for the purpose of funding inventory purchases and the lag period on accounts receivable collections  are important factors impacting our overall liquidity position 
as previously discussed  the company recently renewed its credit facility with bank of america and believes it has a strong working relationship with that financial institution 
additionally  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of september our customers  many of whom are thinly capitalized  do present credit risk 
the company  however  aggressively monitors its exposure in this area and believes it had adequate reserves in place at september the company does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk or fuel costs 
accordingly  significant price movements in these areas can and do impact the company s profitability 
based on these considerations  the company believes its liquidity position going forward will be adequate to sustain operations and fund future growth 
however  as recent events in the financial markets have demonstrated  dramatic shifts in market conditions could materially impact the company s ability to collect on customer accounts receivable balances and or secure bank credit 
while we don t believe the development of such issues in our business is likely  a continued steep deterioration in market conditions could materially impact our liquidity position 
factors that could affect future results wholesale segment the wholesale distribution industry continues to experience a decline in the demand for cigarettes  resulting in part from legislative actions such as higher excise taxes and smoking bans  as well as a general decline in the number of smokers in the united states 
in the past several years  legislation has been proposed to significantly increase the federal excise taxes imposed on cigarette and tobacco products to fund the state children s health insurance program schip 
while such legislation has not passed  it will likely be reintroduced in the future 
if such legislation eventually passed  it could further accelerate the declining demand for cigarettes and tobacco products 
in fiscal  sales of cigarette and tobacco products accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated sales and approximately of its consolidated gross profit 
slumping economic conditions  higher food costs  and the impact of credit card fees have negatively impacted profit margins for many of our customers 
additionally  recent disruptions in the credit markets and unprecedented fuel prices have created a challenging business environment for our largest customer segment convenience stores 
in the short term  the company believes the aforementioned items will pressure future wholesale profits 
the company does not  however  believe such items will materially impact its liquidity position 
while these market conditions present risks  the company believes that on a long term basis  they provide opportunities to enhance shareholder value as smaller distributors are forced from the market creating opportunities to win market share and complete strategic acquisitions at more attractive prices 
retail health food segment our retail segment continues to experience year over year sales growth 
while we enjoy a loyal customer following in this business segment  weak economic conditions combined with higher natural food costs and increased competition may negatively impact future sales growth and gross profit margins 
other matters critical accounting estimates general the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a weekly basis and assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
because credit losses can vary significantly over time  estimating the required allowance requires a number of assumptions that are uncertain 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions 
historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management s review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial wherewithal of particular customers that management deems to have a higher risk of collection 
economic conditions and credit crisis slumping economic conditions  higher food costs  and the impact of credit card fees have negatively impacted profit margins for many of our customers 
additionally  recent disruptions in the credit markets and unprecedented fuel prices have created a challenging business environment for our largest customer segment convenience stores 
the current economic environment has impacted consumer spending on higher profit  discretionary items at convenience stores 
this has a direct impact on convenience stores profitability and ultimately impacts their ability to pay their account timely  or at all 
inventories nature of estimates required 
in our businesses  we carry large quantities and dollar amounts of inventory 
inventories primarily consist of finished products purchased in bulk quantities to be sold to our customers 
given the large quantities and broad range of products we carry  there is a risk that inventory may become impaired because it has become unsaleable or unrefundable  slow moving  obsolete  or because it has been discontinued 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following criteria slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration dates 
we may also discontinue carrying certain product lines for our customers 
as a result  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price the salvage value of the inventory is estimated using management s evaluation of the congestion in the distribution channels and experience with brokers and inventory liquidators to determine the salvage value of the inventory 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets that were acquired in business combinations 
fixed assets and amortizable identified intangible assets are assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
goodwill is not amortized 
impairment of reporting units  which is measured in the company s fourth fiscal quarter in order to coincide with its budgeting process 
the reporting units are valued using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
no impairment charges were recorded by the company in fiscal or fiscal nature of estimates required 
management has to estimate the useful lives of the company s long lived assets 
in regard to the company s impairment analysis  the most significant assumptions include management s estimate of the annual growth rate used to project future sales and expenses 
assumptions and approach used 
for fixed assets  depreciable lives are based on our accounting policy which is intended to mirror the expected useful life of the asset 
in determining the estimated useful life of amortizable intangible assets  such as customer lists  we rely on our historical experience to estimate the useful life of the applicable asset and consider industry norms as a benchmark 
in evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets  we primarily use an income based approach discounted cash flow method in addition to both public and private company information 
a discounted cash flow methodology requires estimation in i forecasting future earnings ii determining the discount rate applicable to the earnings stream being discounted  and iii computing a terminal value at some point in the future 
the forecast of future earnings is an estimate of future financial performance based on current year results and management s evaluation of the market potential for growth 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital using a targeted debt to equity ratio using the industry average under the assumption that it represents our optimal capital structure and can be achieved in a reasonable time period 
the terminal value is determined using a commonly accepted growth model 
insurance the company s insurance for workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits are provided through high deductible or self insured programs 
as a result  the company accrues for its workers compensation liability based upon claim reserves established with the assistance of a third party administrator  which are then trended and developed 
the reserves are evaluated at the end of each reporting period 
due to the uncertainty involved with the realization of claims incurred but unreported  management is required to make estimates of these claims 
assumptions and approach used 
in order to estimate our reserve for incurred but unreported claims we consider the following key factors employee health insurance claims historical claims experience we review loss runs for each month to calculate the average monthly claims experience 
lag period for reporting claims based on analysis and consultation with our third party administrator  our experience is such that we have a minimum of a one month lag period in which claims are reported 
workers compensation insurance claims historical claims experience we review prior years loss runs to estimate the average annual expected claims and review monthly loss runs to compare our estimates to actual claims 
lag period for reporting claims we utilize the assistance of our insurance agent to trend and develop reserves on reported claims in order to estimate the amount of incurred but unreported claims 
our insurance agent uses standard insurance industry loss development models 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a related valuation allowance as appropriate 
in performing our evaluation  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
assumptions and approach used 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
in making that estimate we consider the following key factors our current financial position  historical financial information  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in our wholesale segment when products are delivered to customers which generally is the same day products are shipped and in our retail health food segment when products are sold to consumers 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts  and sales incentives to customers 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate and reserve for anticipated sales discounts 
we also estimate and provide a reserve for anticipated sales incentives to customers when earned under established program requirements 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the sales reserves using the following criteria sales discounts we use historical experience to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected due to customers taking advantage of authorized term discounts 
volume sales incentives we use historical experience in combination with quarterly reviews of customers sales progress in order to estimate the amount of volume incentives due to the customers on a periodic basis 
our estimates and assumptions for each of the aforementioned critical accounting estimates have not changed materially during the periods presented  nor are we aware of any reasons that they would be reasonably likely to change in the future
