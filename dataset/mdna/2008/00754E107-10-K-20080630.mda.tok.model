the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors as well as our financial statements and the related notes 
application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is derived principally from the sales of the company s products 
the company recognizes revenue when the basic criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
are met 
specifically  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  usually in the form of a purchase order  when shipment has occurred since its terms are fob source  or when services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in terms of both credit worthiness of the customer and there are no post shipment obligations or uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides warranty repairs at no cost 
the length of the warranty term is one year from date of shipment 
the company accrues the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs 
the company s management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
the company does not provide price protection or general right of return 
the company s return policy only permits product returns for warranty and non warranty repair or replacement and requires pre authorization by the company prior to the return 
credit or discounts  which have been historically insignificant  may be given at the discretion of the company and are recorded when and if determined 
the company predominantly sells directly to original equipment manufactures with a direct sales force 
the company sells in limited circumstances through distributors 
sales through distributors represent approximately of total revenue 
significant terms and conditions of distributor agreements include fob source  net days payment terms  with no return or exchange rights  and no price protection 
since the product transfers title to the distributor at the time of shipment by the company  the products are not considered inventory on consignment 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test shall consist of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount  as defined 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company s evaluation for the fiscal year ended march   indicated there were no impairments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimated cash flows include management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its then estimated fair value 
the company s evaluation for the fiscal year ended march   indicated there were no impairments 
accounting for income taxes income tax provisions are provided for taxes currently payable or refundable  and for deferred income taxes arising from future tax consequences of events that were recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the effects of income taxes are measured based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
as part our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent operating results and our forecasting process 
the company forecasts taxable income through its budgeting and planning process each year 
the process takes into account existing contracts  firm sales backlog  and projected sales based upon customer supplied forecasts of product purchases its design wins  company resources needed to fulfill these customers requirements  and extraordinary expenses that may be part of long term initiatives to increase shareholder value through revenue growth and efficiency improvements leading to profit improvement 
the company has substantial history  more than years in most cases  with its customers and its market on which its forecasts are based 
at march   our net deferred tax asset before consideration of a valuation allowance mainly consisted of net operating loss carry forwards which expire at various amounts over an approximate year period 
in evaluating this asset  we considered the positive evidence that the company had realized taxable income in of the past years and our projections of future income 
we also considered negative evidence such as the cumulative taxable losses the company experienced over the period and that the company historically had not fully achieved its projected taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  it was the company s judgment that a valuation allowance of  was necessary at march  management estimated that the remaining deferred tax asset of  would more likely than not be realized 
for the year ended march   we incurred additional taxable losses that have increased our net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating our net deferred tax assets at march   we considered the additional negative evidence that we have taxable losses in each of the past two years and cumulative losses over the past three years 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent historical periods is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our recent losses and cumulative loss position during our most recent three year period represents sufficient negative evidence of the need for a full valuation allowance at march  inventories the company s inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost under the first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year 
to calculate a reserve for obsolescence  we begin with a review of our slow moving inventory 
any inventory  which has been slow moving within the past months  is evaluated and reserved if deemed appropriate 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is reserved for at the standard unit cost 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reserved for 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may be reserved 
reserves for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also established 
if a product that had previously been reserved for is subsequently sold  the amount of reserve specific to that item is then reversed
