item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report  all amounts related to us and foreign currency and to the number of shares of nordson corporation common shares  except for per share earnings and dividend amounts  are expressed in thousands 
critical accounting policies and estimates nordson s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to nordson s results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
on a regular basis  critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of nordson s revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including installation or other services  are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element 
if the installation or other services are inconsequential to the functionality of the delivered product  the entire amount of revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the criteria noted above 
inconsequential installation or other services are those that can generally be completed in a short period of time  at insignificant cost  and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to nordson 
if installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until completed 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
revenues deferred in fiscal years  and were not material 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
at october   and october   goodwill represented percent and percent  respectively  of nordson s total assets 
the majority of the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of dage holdings  limited in fiscal year and efd inc in fiscal year in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  or more often if indications of impairment exist 
our reporting units as defined by the standard are our three operating segments  adhesive dispensing systems  advanced technology systems  and industrial coating and automotive systems 
the impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  we calculate a fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the carrying value for net assets of each reporting unit 
this analysis assumed that the impact of current economic conditions upon revenue growth would be temporary lasting through fiscal year and also included savings traced to identified employee reductions associated with announced restructuring actions 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value is compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
the current fair value determination results in an amount that exceeds the carrying amount of each reporting unit by a moderate to substantial margin 
based on these results  the second step of the goodwill impairment test does not need to be performed 

table of contents to test the outcome of the discounted cash flow valuations  the combined results are compared to the market capitalization value net of debt and our published share price 
this comparison indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation is well above the market capitalization at year end  however  this is traced to a recent and dramatic reduction in the trading value of nordson s stock 
with the exception of one quarter in fiscal year  nordson s price earnings multiple has not been below in any quarter over the past years 
the price earnings multiple using the closing price on october  has declined to approximately eleven as a consequence of the current global economic crisis  during which all major stock markets have suffered significant declines 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method for percent of consolidated inventories at october   and percent at october   with the first in  first out fifo method used for the remaining inventory 
on an ongoing basis  inventory is tested for technical obsolescence  as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions 
nordson has historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
inventory reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes 
the inventory reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
the fiscal year increase is attributable to acquisitions and currency changes 
pension plans and postretirement medical plan the measurement of liabilities related to nordson s pension plans and postretirement medical plan is based on management s assumptions related to future factors  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  compensation increases  mortality and turnover assumptions and health care cost trend rates 
effective october   nordson adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r fas 
this statement requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans in their balance sheets 
this amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation of the plans the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
under fas  gains and losses  prior service costs and credits  and any remaining transition amounts under fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and fas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax effects 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  the discount rate for these plans  which comprised percent of the worldwide pension obligations at october   was based on quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of nordson s various international pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  the discount rates used for the international plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  nordson considers both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans 
we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions 
the expected rate of return long term investment rate on domestic pension assets was percent for both fiscal years and the average expected rate of return on international pension assets increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the assumed rate of compensation increases for domestic employees was percent for both fiscal years and the assumed rate of compensation increases for international employees was percent in fiscal year  compared to percent in fiscal year 
table of contents annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year 
differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 
economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate  expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below 
bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 
us international point point point point increase decrease increase decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on pension obligation as of october  expected return on assets effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on pension obligation as of october  compensation increase effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on pension obligation as of october  with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation increased from percent at october  to percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in fiscal year  decreasing gradually to percent in fiscal year for the international postretirement plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation increased from percent at october  to percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in fiscal year  decreasing gradually to percent in fiscal year the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects us international point point point point increase decrease increase decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on postretirement obligation as of october  health care trend rate effect on total service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on postretirement obligation as of october  employees hired after january   are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 
pension and postretirement expenses in fiscal year are expected to be approximately  lower than fiscal year  primarily reflecting changes in actuarial assumptions 

table of contents financial instruments assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
nordson enters into foreign currency forward contracts  which are derivative financial instruments  to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables  payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies 
the maturities of these contracts are usually less than days 
forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period  and the resulting gains or losses are included in other net within other income expense on the consolidated statement of income 
warranties nordson provides customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use 
an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period 
in determining the amount of the accrual  we rely primarily on historical warranty claims by product sold 
amounts charged to the warranty reserve were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
long term incentive compensation plan ltip under the long term incentive compensation plan  executive officers and selected other employees receive cash or stock payouts based solely on corporate performance measures over three year performance periods 
payouts vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold  target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period 
no payout will occur unless nordson equals or exceeds certain threshold performance objectives 
for the fiscal years  fiscal years and the fiscal years performance periods  payouts will be in common shares 
the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each three year period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered 
the calculation is also based upon the weighted average value of nordson s common shares at the dates of grant 
these payouts are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders equity 
the amount recorded at october  for the plans originating in fiscal years  and was compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other employees for fiscal years  and was   and  respectively 
discontinued operations on october   nordson entered into an agreement to sell its fiber systems group to saurer ltd 
for  the fiber systems group was acquired in fiscal year as part of the acquisition of j m laboratories as a means of expanding the adhesive dispensing systems segment 
however  due to the changing competitive environment  the fiber systems group did not meet nordson s financial performance objectives 
the sale enabled us to concentrate our activities on better performing or faster growing businesses 
proceeds of  were received on the closing date  with the remaining to be paid over an month period following the closing date 
settlement of a dispute related to the collectibility of letters of credit resulted in receipt of of the remaining in accordance with fasb statement of accounting standards no 
 the results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations 
accordingly  the revenues  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities  and cash flows of this business have been segregated in the consolidated statements of income  consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows 
sales of the discontinued operations were  for fiscal year the net loss from operations was  for fiscal year included in the fiscal year loss from discontinued operations was severance expense of related to employees of the fiber systems group that were not hired by saurer ltd 
also  included in the fiscal year loss from discontinued operations is the recognition of an impairment of an intangible asset of  a gain of  was recognized on the sale of the assets 
the net tax benefit of  on disposal is the result of  tax expense on one time gains resulting from the disposal  offset by  tax benefit resulting from an excess of tax basis over book basis in fiber systems group assets 

table of contents fiscal years and sales worldwide sales for fiscal year were  an increase of percent from fiscal year sales of  organic sales volume increased percent  while the first year effect of acquisitions accounted for percentage points of the growth 
favorable currency translation effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by an additional percent over the prior year 
sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent  from fiscal year the increase was split evenly between sales volume and favorable currency translation effects 
all product lines within this segment and all geographic regions experienced sales volume increases over the prior year 
sales of the advanced technology systems segment were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent from fiscal year the first year effect of acquisitions generated a volume increase of percent  while organic sales volume increased percent 
favorable currency translation effects contributed percent to sales growth within this segment 
the volume increase can be traced primarily to the asia pacific region  the us and europe  as demand improved for our products in certain semiconductor and consumer electronics end markets 
industrial coating and automotive systems segment sales in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or percent  from the prior year 
the decrease is the result of a sales volume decrease of percent  partially offset by favorable currency translation effects of percent 
the sales volume decrease can be traced to recent cyclical weakness in key consumer durable goods markets  primarily in the us it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 
sales outside the united states accounted for percent of total fiscal year sales  up from percent in fiscal year sales volume in fiscal year exceeded that of fiscal year in all five geographic regions in which we operate  largely driven by the advanced technology systems segment 
sales volume was up percent in asia pacific  percent in europe  percent in japan  percent in the united states and percent in the americas canada  mexico and central and south america 
currency translation effects favorably impacted sales in all international regions 
operating profit cost of sales in fiscal year was  up percent from fiscal year  due primarily to the increase in sales volume 
currency effects increased cost of sales by percent 
gross margins  expressed as a percent of sales  increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the increase was the result of the absence of short term inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions that reduced the fiscal year gross margin percentage by approximately percent and favorable currency effects that increased the fiscal year gross margin rate by percent 
offsetting these items were changes in product mix that reduced the gross margin percentage 
selling and administrative expenses  excluding severance and restructuring costs  were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent  from fiscal year the increase is largely due to the first year effect of fiscal acquisitions  which added percent  and currency translation effects  which added percent 
annual compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the increase 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year  reflecting ongoing operational improvement efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 
in september  nordson announced an acceleration of its ongoing operating margin improvement activities 
this acceleration effort involves a combination of non workforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions primarily in north america and europe with targeted annual savings of approximately  in operating expenses by the end of fiscal year major areas of improvement include the streamlining of marketing and sales organizations  optimization of engineering and information technology resources  rationalization of products  and continued integration of recent acquisitions 
we also expect to reduce exposure to certain underperforming markets 
it is anticipated that non recurring severance and related costs for implementation of these actions will total approximately  with  in charges occurring in and the remainder occurring in fiscal year the severance costs have been recorded in the corporate segment 

table of contents our operating profit margin increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year purchase accounting adjustments for inventory associated with fiscal year acquisitions reduced that year s operating profit margin by percent 
the improvement was also due to favorable currency translation effects and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 
the operating profit margin was reduced by percent as a result of the severance and restructuring costs described above 
segment operating profit margins in fiscal years and were as follows segment adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems industrial coating and automotive systems operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs 
also  currency translation affects reported operating profit margins 
operating profit margins for each segment were favorably impacted from a weaker dollar during the year as compared to the prior year 
operating profit margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was percent  up from percent in fiscal year the increase can be traced to the increased sales volume across all product lines and geographic regions and to favorable currency translation effects 
operating profit margin for the advanced technology systems segment increased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of sales volume increasing at a higher rate than operating costs and the absence of the effect of short term purchase accounting adjustments related to fiscal year acquisitions  partially offset by changes in sales mix 
operating profit margin for the industrial coating and automotive systems segment was percent in fiscal year as compared to percent in fiscal year the decrease in the operating profit margin is primarily due to a sales volume decrease of percent and to a higher mix of lower margin system sales 
interest and other income expense interest expense in fiscal year was  a decrease of  or percent from fiscal year due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
other income was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year included in other income expense were currency gains of  in fiscal year and currency losses of  in fiscal year the prior year amount also included a  gain on the sale leaseback of real estate 
income taxes nordson s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the increased rate is primarily due to a favorable adjustment in fiscal year related to a prior year tax revision 
net income income from continuing operations was  or per diluted share in fiscal year this compares to income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in fiscal year this represents a percent increase in income from continuing operations and a percent increase in earnings per share from continuing operations

fiscal years and sales worldwide sales for fiscal year were  an increase of percent from fiscal year sales of  acquisitions accounted for percentage points of the growth  while sales volume of base businesses increased percent 
favorable currency effects caused by the weaker us dollar increased sales by an additional percent 

table of contents historically  nordson reported results in three operating segments adhesive dispensing systems  advanced technology systems  and finishing and coating systems 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we announced an organizational restructuring in which the portion of the adhesive dispensing systems segment serving the automotive industry was combined with the finishing and coating systems segment to form the newly named industrial coating and automotive systems segment 
the operations of this segment are headquartered in amherst  ohio  are managed by the same executive and share certain resources engineering  sales and factories 
prior fiscal year results have been reclassified to reflect the segment change 
all three segments reported higher sales volume in fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales of the adhesive dispensing systems segment were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent  from fiscal year sales volume was up percent  while currency effects increased reported sales by percent 
the increase in sales volume can be traced to higher system sales in several geographic regions  most notably asia pacific 
sales of the advanced technology systems segment were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent from fiscal year acquisitions generated a volume increase of percent  while sales volume of base businesses was down percent 
favorable currency translation rates contributed percent to sales growth within this segment 
sales within this segment were impacted by weakness in the semiconductor and electronic assembly markets 
industrial coating and automotive systems segment sales in fiscal year were  an increase of  or percent  from the prior year 
this increase can be traced to a volume increase of percent and favorable currency effects of percent 
the volume increase can be traced to higher system sales in japan and asia pacific 
it is estimated that the effect of pricing on total revenue was neutral relative to the prior fiscal year 
sales outside the united states accounted for percent of total fiscal year sales  up from percent in fiscal year sales volume in fiscal year exceeded that the prior year in all five geographic regions  largely driven by acquisitions 
sales volume was up percent in japan  percent in the americas  percent in asia pacific  percent in europe and percent in the united states 
currency effects favorably impacted sales in the americas  asia pacific and europe regions but negatively impacted sales in japan 
operating profit cost of sales in fiscal year was  up percent from fiscal year  due primarily to the increase in sales volume 
currency effects increased cost of sales by percent 
gross margins  expressed as a percent of sales  decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the fiscal year percentage was negatively impacted by short term inventory purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions that reduced the margin percentage by approximately percent 
these adjustments were partially offset by favorable currency effects that increased the gross margin rate by percent 
changes in product mix also contributed to the overall margin percentage decrease 
selling and administrative expenses  excluding severance and restructuring costs  were  in fiscal year  an increase of  or percent  from fiscal year acquisitions and associated purchase accounting adjustments for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets increased selling and administrative expenses by percent  and currency translation effects increased these expenses by percent 
the remainder of the increase was largely due to higher compensation and product development costs 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year  reflecting ongoing operational improvement efforts and revenue increases that were supported by existing capacity 
our operating profit margin decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year purchase accounting adjustments for inventory  property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets associated with fiscal year acquisitions reduced operating profit margin by percent 

table of contents segment operating profit margins in fiscal years and were as follows segment adhesive dispensing systems advanced technology systems industrial coating and automotive systems operating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs 
also  currency translation affects reported operating margins 
operating margins for each of our segments were favorably impacted from a weaker dollar during the year 
operating profit margin for the adhesive dispensing systems segment was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the increase can be traced to the increased sales volume and to favorable currency translation effects 
in march  nordson announced that it would close a manufacturing operation located in talladega  alabama and move production activities to other nordson facilities that are closer to supplier locations 
total severance costs for the affected employees will be approximately and are being recorded over the future service period of april through march the expense amount recorded in fiscal year was during fiscal year  nordson realigned the management of the adhesive dispensing systems segment  which resulted in the elimination of nine positions 
these actions better positioned the segment to achieve our growth objectives 
total costs recorded in fiscal year attributable to the position eliminations were operating profit margin for the advanced technology systems segment decreased to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year the operating profit of this segment was impacted by approximately  of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory  property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets related to the fiscal year acquisitions 
in addition  demand for our base products within this segment declined in fiscal year as capital spending in some of the end markets served by this segment was down from the prior year as customers reacted to capacity requirements and technology shifts 
since the decline in demand is viewed as a cyclical trend  we continued to invest in new product development and distribution capacity for sustained long term sales growth 
the reduced demand resulted in lower manufacturing overhead absorption causing lower operating profit margin for the year 
sales mix also contributed to the decrease in the operating profit margin from the prior year 
in an effort to improve efficiencies in operations serving the curing and drying market  we eliminated positions in the advanced technology systems segment during the second half of fiscal year total costs attributable to the position eliminations were operating profit margin for the industrial coating and automotive systems segment was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the improvement in the operating profit margin is primarily due to sales volume increasing at a rate greater than operating costs 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  nordson began a number of restructuring actions to improve performance and reduce costs in this segment 
these actions  which included operational consolidations and approximately personnel reductions  were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of these actions  this segment now operates with lower costs and improved operating performance 
fiscal year results include  of severance and restructuring costs 
interest and other income expense interest expense in fiscal year was  an increase  or percent from fiscal year due to higher borrowing levels resulting from the four acquisitions made during fiscal year interest and investment income in fiscal year was  down from  in the prior year 
the prior year amount included income of from an income tax refund 
other income was  in fiscal year  as opposed to other expense of  in fiscal year the current year amount included a  gain on the sale leaseback of real estate 
included in other income expense are currency losses of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year income taxes nordson s effective income tax rate on continuing operations was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year the fiscal year rate reflects the approval by the joint committee on taxation of an income tax refund of approximately  the increase in the effective tax rate is also due to higher tax rates on foreign income and a lower extraterritorial income exclusion 

table of contents net income income from continuing operations was  or per diluted share in fiscal year this compares to income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share in fiscal year this represents a percent decrease in income from continuing operations and a percent decrease in earnings per share from continuing operations 
net income  including discontinued operations  was  or per diluted share in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash generated by operations in fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year the primary sources were net income adjusted for the add back of non cash expenses  totaling  compared to  in fiscal year uses of cash from operating activities included  associated with operating assets and liabilities  compared to  in fiscal year the primary reason for the change is a valuation decline in measurement funds underlying deferred compensation plans 
another reduction in cash relates to the difference in translated value of intercompany balances on foreign subsidiary books using average exchange rates and the corresponding balances on the parent company s books using exchange rates in effect at the beginning and end of the fiscal year 
cash used by investing activities was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the prior year amount included  of cash used for acquisitions 
capital expenditures were  in fiscal year and were primarily associated with improvements to the efd building in east providence  rhode island purchased in fiscal year  global information systems and machinery and equipment in china 
cash of  was used for financing activities in fiscal year  compared to cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal year in fiscal year   of short term borrowings net was repaid  and  of scheduled long term debt payments were made 
issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated  of cash 
dividend payments were  in fiscal year  an increase of  from fiscal year due to an increase in the per share amount of percent from fiscal year in fiscal year  net proceeds from short term borrowings of  were used for four acquisitions 
the following is a summary of significant changes in balance sheet captions from the end of fiscal year to the end of fiscal year accounts payable decreased primarily due to the pay down of vendor invoices associated with the demand for inventory 
the decrease in income taxes payable is due to a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  reclassifications to other long term liabilities resulting from the adoption of fin and to tax payments related to current and prior year income 
intangible assets decreased as a result of amortization and currency rate changes 
the decrease in other noncurrent asserts was primarily caused by the lower market value of assets held in a rabbi trust related to a deferred compensation obligation 
the increase in long term pension and retirement liabilities is due to a decrease in the fair value of plan assets partially offset by decreases in obligations from higher discount rates 
on february   we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement the agreement with prudential investment management  inc the agreement consists of a  senior note and a  private shelf facility 
the senior note bears interest at a rate of percent and matures on february  the agreement also contains customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at october  under the private shelf facility  we may also borrow during the next three years unto  at interest rates then in effect at the time of borrowing 
borrowings can be for up to years with an average life not to exceed years 
at october   the amount we could borrow under the private shelf facility would not have been limited by any debt covenants 
the board of directors authorized nordson to repurchase up to  of our common shares over a three year period beginning november the board of directors amended this resolution in august to permit us to enter into written agreements with independent third party brokers to purchase common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
uses for repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs  including stock options  restricted stock and k matching 
shares purchased are treated as treasury shares until used for such purposes 
the repurchase program is funded using working capital 
during fiscal year  nordson repurchased of the shares authorized to be repurchased under this program for  
table of contents the following table summarizes obligations as of october  payments due by period less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases notes payable interest payments on long term debt contributions related to pension and postretirement benefits purchase obligations total obligations nordson has various lines of credit with both domestic and foreign banks 
at october   these lines totaled  of which  was unused 
included in the total amount of  was a  unsecured  multicurrency credit facility with a group of banks that expires in fiscal year this facility may be increased by  to  under certain conditions 
at october    was outstanding under this facility  compared to  outstanding at october  there are two primary financial covenants that must be met under this facility 
the first covenant limits the amount of total indebtedness that can be incurred to times consolidated trailing ebitda both indebtedness and ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
the second covenant requires trailing consolidated trailing ebitda to be at least three times consolidated trailing interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october  pension and postretirement plan funding amounts after fiscal year will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time 
we believe that the combination of present capital resources  internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for fiscal year there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 
outlook current disruptions in global financial markets and resulting turmoil in the general economic environment will have an impact on nordson s performance  however  we believe we are well positioned to manage the impact upon our liquidity 
our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
primary sources of liquidity to meet these needs are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements 
cash provided by operations extending back to the end of the recession ranged from percent to percent of net sales 
during the and recession years  cash from operations were percent and percent of net sales  respectively 
since the recession of  nordson has enhanced its sources of revenue by expanding its diversity of end markets and geographies into which it sells and also has employed lean practices into all areas of operations to gain cost efficiencies and improve operating margins and cash flow from operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we announced an acceleration of ongoing operational improvement activities as described above 
cash is available through a  year committed revolving line of credit with domestic and international banks 
this line of credit was put into place in july and expires in july as of october  we are in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility and have  available borrowing capacity 
in addition  in february  nordson put in place a master shelf arrangement with the prudential insurance company to allow for the issuance of medium to long term unsecured notes 
as of october   we are in compliance with the financial covenant relating to a  five year note issued under this arrangement 
while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing  we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event of these financial institutions failure to remain sufficiently capitalized 

table of contents nordson s priorities for fiscal year are focused upon the continuation of strategic actions to optimize revenue opportunities in a challenging economic environment and achieve its expectations for operational improvements through a combination of non workforce related efficiencies and workforce reductions 
major areas of improvement include the streamlining of marketing and sales organizations  optimization of engineering and information technology resources  rationalization of products  and continued integration of recent acquisitions 
we also expect to reduce exposure to certain underperforming markets 
given the current economic challenges  we expect this focus to result in optimized improvements in cash provided by operations 
with respect to spending  the table above presents nordson s financial obligations for the long term being  of which  is payable in  excluding amounts payable under terms of our revolving line of credit 
on december   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to  shares over a three year period beginning december  under this authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions  repayment of debt and our share price 
capital expenditures for will be reduced from recent years and primarily focused upon our in process rollout of sap enterprise management software and various projects that improve manufacturing and distribution 
we will continue to look for strategic acquisition opportunities  develop new applications and markets for our technologies  and move forward with our initiatives to improve operating performance 
effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured because of fluctuating selling prices  sales volume  product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate 
as a general rule  a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income  while a strengthening of the us dollar has a detrimental effect 
in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  the us dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies 
if fiscal year exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year  sales would have been approximately  lower and third party costs would have been approximately  lower 
in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  the us dollar was also generally weaker against foreign currencies 
if fiscal year exchange rates had been in effect during fiscal year  sales would have been approximately  lower and third party costs would have been approximately  lower 
these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk nordson operates internationally and enters into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions 
these contracts  primarily euro  british pound and yen  usually have maturities of days or less  and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates stated in the contracts 
gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains  respectively  on the underlying transactions 
other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of nordson s net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a long term investment nature 
as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies  as of october   we did not have a material foreign currency risk 
note to the financial statements contains additional information about nordson s foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions 
a portion of our operations is financed with short term and long term borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates for long term debt

table of contents inflation inflation affects profit margins because the ability to pass cost increases on to customers is restricted by the need for competitive pricing 
although inflation has been modest in recent years and has had no material effect on the years covered by these financial statements  we continue to seek ways to minimize the impact of inflation through focused efforts to raise productivity
