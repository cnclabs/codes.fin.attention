reverse osmosis technology the conversion of saltwater to potable water is called desalination 
the two primary forms of desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis 
both methods are used throughout the world and technologies are improving to lower the costs of production 
reverse osmosis is a separation process in which the water from a pressurized saline solution is separated from the dissolved material by passing it over a semi permeable membrane 
the saline or feed water is first passed through a pretreatment system  which generally consists of fine filtration and the addition of precipitation inhibitors 
pre treatment removes suspended solids  prevents salt precipitation and keeps the membranes free of microorganisms 
next  a high pressure pump enables the water to actually pass through the membrane  while dissolved salts are rejected 
the feed water is pumped into a vessel where it is pressurized against the membrane 
as a portion of the feed water passes through the membrane leaving more than of its dissolved solids behind  the remaining feed water increases in salt content 
this remaining feed water is discharged without passing through the membrane 
the energy created by this concentrated feed water or brine as it leaves the pressure vessel is used by an energy recovery device to assist in pressurizing new feed water subsequently introduced into the pressure vessel 
the final step is post treatment  which consists of stabilizing the water  removing undesirable dissolved gases and adjusting the ph and chlorination to prepare it for distribution 
we use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water 
we believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our market 
however  we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new  more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water 
the equipment at our plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain our equipment in an efficient manner 
as a result of our years of experience in seawater desalination  we believe that we have an expertise in the development and operation of desalination plants which is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas 
raw materials and sources of supply all materials  parts and supplies essential to our business operations can normally be obtained from multiple sources  except for the dweer energy recovery devices which are exclusively manufactured by calder ag  a swiss company  and which we use at the majority of plants 
we do not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business 
our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we have our operations 
seasonal variations in our business our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize and bimini  the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell slightly more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that our operations in nassau and tortola will be subject to significant seasonal variations in demand 
government regulations  custom duties and taxes our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate 
the following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses 
legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future 
any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results 
the cayman islands the cayman islands are a british overseas territory and have had a stable political climate since  when the treaty of madrid ceded the cayman islands to england 
the queen of england appoints the governor of the cayman islands to make laws with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly 
there are elected members of the legislative assembly and three members appointed by the governor from the civil service 
the cabinet is responsible for day to day government operations 
the cabinet consists of five ministers who are chosen by the legislative assembly from its popularly elected members  and the three civil service members 
the governor has reserved powers and the united kingdom retains full control over foreign affairs and defense 
the cayman islands are a common law jurisdiction and have adopted a legal system similar to that of the united kingdom 

table of contents the cayman islands have no taxes on profits  income  distributions  capital gains or appreciation 
we have exemptions from  or receive concessionaire rates of customs duties on capital expenditures for plant and major consumable spare parts and supplies imported into the cayman islands as follows we do not pay import duty or taxes on reverse osmosis membranes  electric pumps and motors and chemicals  but we do pay duty at the rate of of the cost  including insurance and transportation to the cayman islands  of other plant and associated materials and equipment to manufacture or supply water in the seven mile beach or west bay areas  and oc cayman pays all customs duties up to with respect to materials and supplies imported for the red gate plant and is reimbursed amounts in excess of this percentage by the water authority cayman 
oc cayman pays full customs duties in respect of all other plants that it operates for water authority cayman 
the stamp tax to depending on location on the transfer of ownership of land in the cayman islands is a major source of revenue to the cayman islands government 
to prevent stamp tax avoidance by transfer of ownership of the shares of a company which owns land in the cayman islands as opposed to transfer of the land itself  the land holding companies share transfer tax law was passed in the effect of this law is to charge a company  which owns land or an interest in land in the cayman islands  a tax based on the value of its land or interest in land attributable to each share transferred 
the stamp tax calculation does not take into account the proportion which the value of a company s cayman land or interest in land bears to its total assets and whether the intention of the transfer is to transfer ownership of part of a company s entire business or a part of its cayman land or interest in land prior to our common shares becoming publicly traded in the united states  we paid this tax on private share transfers 
we have never paid the tax on transfers of our publicly traded shares and requested an exemption in on april   we received notice that the cayman islands government had granted an exemption from taxation for all transfers of our shares 
we believe it is unlikely that government will seek to collect this tax on transfers of our publicly traded shares during through april  the bahamas the commonwealth of the bahamas is an independent nation and a constitutional parliamentary democracy with the queen of england as the constitutional head of state 
the basis of bahamian law and legal system is the english common law tradition with a supreme court  court of appeals  and a magistrates court 
we have not been granted any tax exemptions for our bahamian operations 
bahamian companies are subject to an annual business license fee ranging from to of their gross revenues 
we did not pay any business license fees to the bahamian government in respect of our bimini retail water operations since commencement of operations on july   other than contributions to the national insurance board social security fund on behalf of our employees 
on january  we transferred our bimini assets to cw bahamas and expect to pay all applicable business license fees in connection with the bimini operations for and in the future

gross receipts tax payable amounts are credited towards corporate income tax 
the government of belize recently implemented certain environmental taxes and a general sales tax effective july  and increased certain business and personal taxes and created new taxes effective march  under the old tax structure without our exemption  we believe our business would be subject to a gross receipts tax and income tax

however  oc bvi  received an exemption  under the water supply agreement with the british virgin islands government  from all taxes  duties  levies and impositions on items  which it imports for the baughers bay plant 
market and service area although we currently operate in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands and the bahamas  we believe that our potential market consists of any location where there is a need for potable water 
the desalination of seawater  either through distillation or reverse osmosis  is the most widely used process for producing fresh water in areas with an insufficient natural supply 
we believe our experience in the development and operation of distillation and reverse osmosis desalination plants as well as our exclusive rights in the caribbean to the dweer energy recovery system provides us with a significant opportunity to successfully expand our operations beyond the markets in which we currently operate 
prior to our acquisition of oc cayman in february  the market that we serviced under our exclusive license in the cayman islands consisted of seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman  two of the three most populated areas in the cayman islands 
the cayman islands government  through water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman  which are not within our licensed area  as well as to little cayman and cayman brac 
we operate all the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by water authority cayman on grand cayman and supply water under licenses and supply agreements held by oc cayman with water authority cayman 
according to the most recent information published by the economics and statistics office of the cayman islands government  the population of the cayman islands was estimated in december to be approximately  according to the figures published by the department of tourism statistics information center  during the year ended december  tourist air arrivals increased by and tourist cruise ship arrivals decreased over the same period in total visitors for the year decreased from million in to million in we believe that our water sales in the cayman islands are more positively impacted by tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship  since cruise ship tourists generally only remain on island for one day or less as they do not remain on island overnight 
tourist air arrivals increased and cruise ship arrivals decreased in january compared to the same period in at this time we are not able to determine whether these trends will continue through in december  the ritz carlton hotel  condominiums and golf course development began operations 
this development is required to purchase potable water from us for the hotel and condominiums under the terms of our exclusive license agreement  but not for its golf course 
during  the government of the cayman islands amended the development and planning law to permit construction of buildings up to seven stories in certain zones within our license area  including commercial and hotel zones 
previously  buildings in these zones were only permitted to be built to three stories 
we believe that this change in the law has and will continue to facilitate the development of certain properties within our license area that may have otherwise not developed under the old height restriction  and 
table of contents it has already facilitated the re development of a number of existing properties  which have been demolished and are being re built under the terms of the new height restrictions 
our current operations in belize are located on ambergris caye  which consists of residential  commercial and tourist properties in the town of san pedro 
this town is located on the southern end of ambergris caye 
ambergris caye is one of many islands located east of the belize mainland and off the southeastern tip of the yucatan peninsula 
ambergris caye is approximately miles long and  according to the belize national population census  has a population of about  residents  which has increased approximately over the previous ten years 
we provide bulk potable water to bwsl  which distributes this water to this market 
bwsl currently has no other source of potable water on ambergris caye 
our contract with bwsl makes us their exclusive producer of desalinated water on ambergris caye though a mile long barrier reef  which is the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere  is situated just offshore of ambergris caye 
this natural attraction is becoming a choice destination for scuba divers and tourists 
according to information published by the belize trade and investment development service  tourism is belize s second largest source of foreign income  next to agriculture 
our current operations in the bahamas are located on south bimini island and in nassau on new providence 
the bimini islands consist of north bimini and south bimini  and are two of islands which comprise the bahamas 
the bimini islands are located approximately miles east of ft

competition cayman islands 
pursuant to our license granted by the cayman islands government  we have the exclusive right to provide retail water within our licensed service area on grand cayman 
at the present time  we are the only non government owned public water utility on grand cayman 
the cayman islands government  through water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman located outside of our licensed service area 
although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area  our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the cayman island government 
prior to  any owner of property within our exclusive retail license service area could install water making equipment for its own use 
since  that option is only available to private residences  although water plants in existence prior to can be maintained but not replaced or expanded 
the cayman islands government  through water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman outside of our licensed service area 
we compete with such companies as ge water  veolia  and ide for bulk water supply contracts with the water authority cayman 
belize 
on ambergris caye in belize  our water supply contract with belize water services limited is exclusive  and belize water services limited can no longer seek contracts with other water suppliers  or produce water themselves  to meet their future needs in san pedro  ambergris caye  belize 
the bahamas 
on south bimini island in the bahamas  we supply water to a private developer and do not have competitors

we competed with companies such as ge water  veolia  ide  pridesa  inima and biwater for the new contract with the bahamian government to build and operate a seawater desalination plant at blue hills  new providence  bahamas 
we expect to compete with these companies and others for future water supply contracts in the bahamas 
british virgin islands 
in the british virgin islands  ge water operates seawater desalination plants in west end and sea cows bay  tortola  and on virgin gorda and generally bids against oc bvi for projects 

table of contents to implement our growth strategy outside our existing operating areas  we will have to compete with the same companies we competed with for the blue hills project in nassau  bahamas such as ge water  veolia  ide  pridesa  inima and biwater 
these companies currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our operations 
these companies already maintain worldwide operations and have greater financial  managerial and other resources than our company 
we believe that our low overhead costs  knowledge of local markets and conditions and our efficient manner of operating desalinated water production and distribution equipment will provide us competitive advantage on projects in the caribbean basin and surrounding areas 
environmental matters cayman islands

our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future 
in the cayman islands  we provide water to retail customers under a license originally issued to us in december by the cayman islands government that grants us the exclusive right to provide water to retail customers within our licensed service area 
our service area is comprised of an area on grand cayman that includes the seven mile beach and west bay areas  two of the three most populated areas in the cayman islands 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our consolidated revenue from our retail water operations conducted pursuant to our exclusive license 
our license expires in july if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government offers to any third party 
if we are unable to renew our license or negotiate a new license on satisfactory terms  we could lose a significant portion of our current revenues and our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we rely on fixed term water supply and or service agreements with our bulk customers in the cayman islands  belize and the bahamas  which may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
all of our bulk water supply agreements are for fixed terms ranging originally from seven to years and with a range of approximately one to years remaining 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on less favorable terms 
in addition  certain of these agreements for plants not owned by us provide for our customers to take over the operations of the plant upon expiration of the contract term 
if this occurs  we may no longer generate income from such plant 
in instances where we own the plant that produces the water under an agreement that is not renewed or renewed with lower production quantities  we may not be able to find a new customer for the plant s excess production capacity 
if our fixed term agreements are not renewed or are renewed on less favorable terms  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the water supply agreement between the british virgin islands water and sewerage department and our affiliate  oc bvi  is on a month to month basis and could be cancelled or renegotiated on less favorable terms 
since the expiration of the initial term of their bulk water supply agreement in may  oc bvi has supplied water to the british virgin islands water and sewerage department under what it considers to be a month to month supply arrangement 
under this arrangement  the british virgin islands government could cease purchasing water from oc bvi at any time 
oc bvi has continued to make attempts to negotiate a new water supply agreement 
however  this agreement may not be renewed and a new agreement may not be reached 
if a new agreement is obtained  it may be on terms less favorable to oc bvi than the current arrangement 
for the years ended december   and we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in income from our equity investment in the earnings of oc bvi 
for these same years  we recognized approximately   and  respectively  in revenues from our agreement to provide management services to oc bvi 
we also recognized approximately   and  in other income for the years ended december   and  respectively  from a profit sharing agreement we have with oc bvi 
as of december   our loans to  and equity investment in  oc bvi equaled approximately million and the recorded value of our management services agreement  which is reflected on our balance sheet as an intangible asset  was approximately  in the event that the british virgin islands government ceased purchasing water from oc bvi  or entered into a new contract with oc bvi on less favorable terms than the existing supply arrangement  the values of our investment in oc bvi  loan to oc bvi and oc bvi intangible asset would decline  and we could be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of these assets 
such impairment charges could reduce our earnings and could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the british virgin islands government has asserted a purported right of ownership of oc bvi s baughers bay plant 
if this right is found to be enforceable and is exercised by the government  oc bvi will lose ownership of the baughers bay plant 
in october  the british virgin islands government notified oc bvi that it was asserting a purported right of ownership of oc bvi s desalination plant in baughers bay  tortola pursuant to the terms of a water supply agreement dated may or the agreement and invited oc bvi to submit a proposal for its continued involvement in the production of water at the baughers bay plant 
while oc bvi believes that the government s claim can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties through the negotiation of a new agreement  we cannot assure you that the government shares this belief or that such a result will occur 
on november   oc bvi issued a demand letter to the bvi government for approximately million representing amounts that oc bvi claimed were due by the bvi government for water sold and delivered plus interest and legal fees 
in response to oc bvi s demand for payment  the bvi government issued a letter dated november  that reasserted its claim that ownership of the baughers bay plant has passed to the bvi government and rejected oc bvi s claim for payment 
oc bvi advised the bvi government in correspondence dated november  that it was demanding that the dispute between oc bvi and the bvi government be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
on the following day  oc bvi s management was informed that the bvi government had filed a lawsuit with the eastern caribbean supreme court seeking ownership of the baughers bay plant 
for the years ended december  and we recognized approximately million and million  respectively in income from our equity investment in the earnings of oc bvi and approximately  and million in revenue  respectively  from our agreement to provide management services to oc bvi 
we also recognized approximately  and  in other income for the years ended december  and  respectively  from a profit sharing agreement we have with oc bvi 
as of december   our loans to  and equity investment in  oc bvi totaled approximately million and the recorded value of our management services agreement  which is reflected on our balance sheet as an intangible asset  was approximately  if the government s right of ownership under the agreement is found to be enforceable  oc bvi may be forced to accept a water supply arrangement with the government on less favorable terms  and if the government exercises its purported right  oc bvi could lose ownership of the baughers bay plant 
in either case  the value of our oc bvi related assets would decline  and we could be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of these assets 
such impairment charges would reduce our earnings and could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our income from oc bvi may be reduced if oc bvi continues to experience difficulty in collecting the amounts it invoices to the bvi government 
early in  the british virgins island government unilaterally took the position that until such time as a new agreement is reached on the ownership of the baughers bay plant and the price for the water produced by the plant  the bvi government would only pay that amount of oc bvi s invoices that the ministry purports constitutes oc bvi s costs of producing the water 
at its proposed interim price  the ministry would pay only approximately of the amounts billed by oc bvi pending a new agreement 
oc bvi responded to the ministry that the amount the ministry proposed to pay was significantly less than oc bvi s production costs 
payments made by the ministry to oc bvi since the ministry s assumption of this reduced price have been sporadic and as of december  oc bvi had received payment for less than of the amounts it billed the ministry for the year then ended 
as of december  oc bvi had million in gross accounts receivable balances due from the bvi government 
in january the bvi government remitted a partial payment on these receivables to oc bvi of million 
if oc bvi continues to experience difficulty in collecting the amounts it invoices to the bvi government  it may be required to defer  or reserve for  all or a portion of the revenues it invoices but has not yet collected from the bvi government 
should this occur  the income amounts we record from our various oc bvi related assets would decline  and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we do not have sole control over our affiliate  oc bvi 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of oc bvi s other voting shareholder may adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and in turn decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi 
we own of the equity and of the voting shares of oc bvi 
we and sage  which owns the remaining of the voting shares  are each entitled to appoint three of the six directors of oc bvi 
if there is a vote of the directors on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association  a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives  is entitled to appoint a temporary director to cast the deciding vote 
as a result  although we provide operating management and engineering services to oc bvi  we share the overall management of oc bvi with sage and do not fully control its operations 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of sage could adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and in turn decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi  in which case we could be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such an impairment charge would reduce our earnings and have a significant adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the profitability of our plants is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs of their construction and operation 
the cost estimates prepared in connection with the construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties 
additionally  the terms of our supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of desalinated water on a per unit basis  subject to certain annual inflation and monthly fuel cost adjustments  and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated 
because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs  the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant  which could cause the gross margin and net return on investment for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs 
these future operating costs could be affected by a variety of factors  including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those that existed at the time we submitted our bid 
any construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from two customers 
a loss of  or a less favorable relationship with either of these customers would adversely affect our results of operations 
our top two bulk water customers accounted for approximately and of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if either of these customers terminate or decide not to renew their contracts with us  or renew such contracts on terms that are less favorable to us  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if oc bvi does not obtain a contract with the bvi government to sell water to be produced at its bar bay plant  it may not be able to recover the cost of its investment in the plant  which could adversely affect its operations and in turn decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi 
oc bvi has constructed a new desalination plant located on bar bay  tortola  in the british virgin islands 
the total cost for this plant is approximately million 
we have a loan receivable outstanding from oc bvi of  for the construction of this plant as of december  oc bvi has constructed this plant in response to what it believes is an extreme shortage of  and a pressing demand for  potable water on the eastern end of tortola and anticipates entering into a bulk water supply agreement with the british virgin islands government 
however  oc bvi does not presently have any type of agreement or understanding with the british virgin islands government  for the purchase of the water to be produced by its bar bay plant 
if such an agreement is not obtained  or is not obtained on sufficiently favorable terms  oc bvi may not be able to recover the cost of its investment in this plant  in which case we may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our loan to oc bvi and our investment in oc bvi 
such an impairment charge would reduce our earnings and could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect demand for our water and impact our revenues and results of operations 
our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize and bimini  the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell slightly more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
a downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
our expansion both within our current operating areas and into new areas involves significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations and currency controls

even if we successfully expand our operations  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations within or outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively affect our overall profitability 
continued production shortfalls under our windsor supply contract could result in further rate decreases or cancellation of the contract 
our supply contract  through our subsidiary  cw bahamas  with the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas wsc to supply water from our windsor plant located on the island of new providence in the bahamas expires upon the earlier of either i march or ii cw bahamas supply of billion gallons of water to the wsc 
since the plant was commissioned in  fouling of its reverse osmosis membrane elements has occurred several times 
from time to time since october  we have been unable to deliver the minimum water volumes required under the contract because of mechanical equipment problems and membrane fouling 
as a result  we have been subject to water rate decreases that decreased revenue by approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
we have implemented an extensive program to test and understand the cause of the membrane fouling and have expanded the production capacity of the windsor plant in order to replace the production capacity that was lost because of membrane fouling 
at present  we believe we have resolved the membrane fouling problem at the windsor plant 
however  membrane fouling may reoccur at the windsor plant  and if we are unable to meet the production minimums due to this or other operating issues  we could be in technical default of the windsor supply contract and subject to various adverse consequences  including further water rate decreases or cancellation of the contract by the wsc 
our operations could be harmed by hurricanes or tropical storms 
a hurricane or tropical storm could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation 
for example  in september hurricane ivan caused significant damage to our plants and our customers properties  which adversely affected our revenues 
any future damage could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs 
damage to our customers properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand 
a hurricane or tropical storm could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies  including electricity  necessary to our operations 
these and other possible effects of hurricanes or tropical storms could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
contamination of our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference  including acts of terrorism 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
an inability by us to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations 
potential government decisions  actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations 

table of contents we are subject to the local regulations of the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands and the bahamas  all of which are subject to change 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership of us  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  unilaterally changing or renegotiating our licenses and agreements  restricting the transfer of us currency  or causing currency exchange fluctuations devaluations or making changes in tax laws 
as new laws and regulations are issued  we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy  which we may be unable to do in a cost effective manner 
failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate  the assessment of penalties or fines  or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the rates we charge our retail customers in the cayman islands are subject to regulation 
if we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases  or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our projected expenses  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
under our exclusive retail license in the cayman islands  we must obtain prior approval from the cayman islands government to increase our water supply rates  except for inflation related adjustments 
however  the expenses we incur in supplying water under this license may increase due to circumstances that were unforeseen at the time we entered into the license 
we may incur additional costs in attempting to obtain government approval of any rate increase  which may be granted on a delayed basis  if at all 
failure to obtain timely and adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on the efforts of key employees 
our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of fredrick w 
mctaggart  our president and chief executive officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
mr 
mctaggart has an employment agreement expiring on december  each year  the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year 
however  we cannot guarantee that mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will enter into any extensions thereof 
we are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers and our affiliate 
we are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands and the bahamas and by possible defaults in payment of loan receivables by oc bvi and water authority cayman 
adverse economic conditions affecting  or financial difficulties of  those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment 
we depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis 
our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenue is earned in other currencies 
all of the currencies in our operating areas have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years and we do not employ a hedging strategy against exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents we may enter new markets in the future in which we do not have a contractual commitment for our products or existing customers 
our strategy contemplates potential entry into new markets where we believe a demand for potable water exists beyond the current supply of potable water in those markets we may decide to enter such markets by building new reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water produced by the new plant 
if after completing such plant we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant  we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
future sales of our ordinary shares may depress the market price of our ordinary shares 
if we or our existing shareholders sell substantial amounts of ordinary shares or if it is perceived that such sales could occur  the market price of our ordinary shares could decline 
in addition  if these sales were to occur  we may find it difficult to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem desirable 
we may not pay dividends in the future 
if dividends are paid  they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends 
our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if  and when  they are declared by our board of directors 
we have paid dividends in the past  but may cease to do so at any time 
under the agreements governing certain of our outstanding debt obligations  we may only pay dividends from cash flows  defined under the applicable agreement as consolidated net income plus non cash charges less capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayment  calculated annually on a fiscal year basis 
we may incur increased capital requirements or additional indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends 
we may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws  our financial condition and results of operations  covenants contained in our financing agreements  management s assessment of future capital needs and other factors considered by our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or  if dividends are paid  that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the united states 
in addition  out of of our directors and officers reside outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon us and such other persons  or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in united states courts  and bring any action  including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws 
in addition  it may be difficult for investors to enforce  in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the united states  rights predicated upon the united states securities laws 
based on the advice of our cayman islands legal counsel  myers and alberga  we believe there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  and that foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act  or the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act  for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands  such as treble damages  would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances 
low trading volume of our stock may limit your ability to sell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
during the year ended december   the average daily trading volume of our ordinary shares was approximately  shares  a much lower trading volume than the stock of many other companies listed on the nasdaq global select market 
a public trading 
table of contents market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our ordinary shares at any given time 
this presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
as a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our ordinary shares  an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling a large number of our ordinary shares in the manner or at the price that might be attainable if our ordinary shares were more actively traded 
in addition  as a result of our low trading volume  the market price of our ordinary shares may not accurately reflect their value 
competition may threaten the sustainability and growth of our current operations and impede the expansion of our operations into new areas 
we face competition in our areas of operation in renewing our present supply contracts and in our efforts to expand our current operations within those areas 
we also face competition in attempting to expand our operations to new areas 
we often compete with larger companies  including units of general electric company and veolia environment 
some of our current and potential competitors have technical and financial resources and marketing and service organizations that are significantly greater than ours 
moreover  our competitors may forecast the course of market developments more accurately and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our services 
additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter those markets  thereby further intensifying competition 
these competitors may be able to reduce our market share by adopting more aggressive pricing policies than we can adopt or by developing technology and services that gain wider market acceptance than our technology and or services 
if we do not compete successfully  we may be unable to maintain or increase our operations and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are subject to anti takeover measures that may discourage  delay or prevent changes of control of consolidated water co 
ltd 
classified board of directors 
we have a classified board that consists of three groups of directors 
only one group of directors is elected each year 
our classified board may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors in order to gain control of our board 
option deed 
our board of directors has adopted an option deed that is intended to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire our outstanding stock 
under the terms of the option deed  a stock purchase right is attached to each of our current or future outstanding ordinary shares issued prior to the time the purchase rights become exercisable  are redeemed or expire 
the purchase rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding ordinary shares 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the rights will entitle every holder of our ordinary shares  other than the acquirer  to purchase our shares or shares of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer 
under certain circumstances  instead of ordinary shares  our board of directors may issue cash or debt securities 
our board of directors  however  has the power to amend the option deed so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable 
these features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on our board of directors taking action to prevent the purchase rights from becoming exercisable 
in march  our board extended the expiration date of the option deed through july as a result of these anti takeover measures  we could deter efforts to make changes to  or exercise control over  current management 
in addition  our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their ordinary shares to a potential acquirer at the acquirer s offering price  which is typically at a premium to market price 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and trust deeds could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility  our failure to comply with these covenants could cause foreclosure on our assets 
our credit facilities and the trust deeds governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants and requirements limit our ability  without approval of the lender or trustee  to take various actions  including incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures  guaranteeing indebtedness  engaging in various types of transactions  including mergers and sales of assets  and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments 
these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may not be required to operate under these or similar restrictions 
further  these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  acquisition or investment opportunities 
a material breach of any of these covenants would constitute a default under our credit facilities or trust deeds 
in the event of default  the lender or trustee may accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay the amounts accelerated  the lender or trustee has the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets  which we have pledged to secure that indebtedness 
foreclosure upon our assets would have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations  financial condition and our ability to continue operations

use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  allowances for receivables and inventory  and the fair value of our investment in affiliate 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
basis of consolidation for consolidation purposes  we evaluate our investments in subsidiaries and affiliates in accordance with the guidance set forth in accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements and related pronouncements  including financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or more of the characteristics defined in the interpretation 
we consolidate the results of those affiliates that possess the characteristics of a variable interest entity and for which the company is the primary financial beneficiary 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries cayman water company limited  consolidated water belize limited  ocean conversion cayman limited  desalco limited  desalco barbados ltd  aquilex  inc and our majority owned subsidiary consolidated water bahamas limited 
in accordance with fin r the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of our owned affiliate consolidated water bermuda limited 
all inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill 
management identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each 
table of contents reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
our annual tests have resulted in no goodwill impairment 
plant construction revenue and cost of plant construction revenue we recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on fixed price contracts for the construction of desalination plants to be sold to third parties using the percentage of completion method  which relies on contract revenue and estimates of total expected costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and recognize profit or loss as work on the contract progresses 
our engineering personnel estimate total project costs and profit to be earned on each long term  fixed price contract prior to commencement of work on the contract and updates these estimates as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date comprises of estimated total contract costs 
if  as work progresses  the actual contract costs exceed estimates  the profit recognized on revenue from that contract decreases 
we recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on a contract at the time the estimates indicate such a loss 
any costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are classified as current assets 
accounts receivable  net  at december  includes approximately  in estimated earnings in excess of billings related to the construction of the tynes bay plant in bermuda 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as current liabilities 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation commences in the month the asset is placed in service and is calculated using a straight line method with an allowance for estimated residual value 
rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings to years plant and equipment to years distribution system to years office furniture  fixtures and equipment to years vehicles to years leasehold improvements lesser of years or operating lease term lab equipment to years additions to property  plant and equipment are comprised of the cost of the contracted services  direct labor and materials 
assets under construction are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment upon completion of a project 
improvements that significantly increase the value of property  plant and equipment are capitalized 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements are charged to expense as incurred 
construction in progress the cost of borrowed funds directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets  which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be ready for their intended use  are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for use or sale 
trade accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
management continuously evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances based on estimates of the level of actual write offs that might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history

for further discussion of revenues and gross profit for the year ended december   see the results by segment analysis that follows 
general and administrative g a expenses were  and  on a consolidated basis for and  respectively 
compensation expenses for exceeded those for by approximately  due to incremental hires for our aquilex office and an increase in accrued management bonuses

by volume of gallons sold  our retail revenues increased by approximately in when compared to as a result of the added revenues the retail segment generated gross profit of  of revenues in as compared to  of revenues in consistent with prior periods  we record all non direct g a expenses in our retail business segment and do not allocate any of these non direct costs to our other two business segments 
retail g a expenses for were  up  from the increase in g a expenses for is attributable to a rise in compensation expense of approximately  resulting from incremental hires for our aquilex office and an increase in accrued management bonuses as well as incremental directors fees and expenses of approximately  during  we changed the bonus arrangements for our executive management and we reduced the size of some of our board committees with the intention of reducing the aggregate amount paid for directors fees and expenses in from that paid in bulk segment bulk segment revenues were  and  for and  respectively 
revenues from the bulk segment grew from to primarily due to our operations in the bahamas  as our blue hills plant did not begin operations until july gross profit dollars for our bulk segment were  and  for and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of bulk revenues was for both and during  the gross profit for our bahamas operations benefited from the windsor plant expansion project  whereby we expanded the capacity of our windsor plant and increased its revenues through the use of six containerized production units 
these units were operated with existing staff and minimal additional other costs 
as a result  the revenues generated from the production of these units during were at significantly higher gross profits as a percentage of revenues than the revenues for four of these containerized production units were transferred from the bahamas to our grand cayman retail operations in the third quarter of 
table of contents the bulk segment gross profit was adversely affected by the non revenue water nrw component of our agreement with the wsc for the blue hills plant 
this element of the agreement required us to reduce the amount of water lost by the public water distribution system on new providence island over a one year period by million us gallons 
until such time as we demonstrated to the wsc that we have achieved this reduction  we were required to provide million us gallons of water per day to the wsc from the blue hills plant at no cost to the wsc 
the variable costs associated with providing this free water to wsc were significant to overall plant operating costs and impacted the overall gross profit on water revenues from the blue hills plant during we have diligently pursued completion of the nrw project in order to reduce operating costs and improve the profitability of the blue hills operation 
in september  using standards promulgated by the international water association  we completed an internal assessment of our progress in achieving the water savings required under the blue hills agreement and submitted our assessment to the wsc 
based upon this assessment  the standards for which require us to validate the results for a period of time prior to september  we believe we met the nrw requirement effective march  consequently  we invoiced the wsc but did not previously recognize as revenue approximately  for the non revenue water provided for the period from march  through september  the wsc has confirmed by letter dated january  that the nrw project was completed on july  but has not provided any technical support for this later completion date 
we have disputed the july  completion date and have asked the wsc for technical information in support of its decision 
we have subsequently closed out the nrw project and discharged all remaining nrw obligations to the wsc 
based upon the january  correspondence from the wsc we recognized  in revenue during the fourth quarter of relating to the period july  to september  and recognized revenues for all water delivered to the wsc during the fourth quarter of while we believe we have met the nrw requirement as of march  and are therefore contractually entitled to receive payment for all of these nrw invoices  because of the uncertainty associated with the wsc review and approval of our assessment we have reserved for the nrw amounts invoiced for the period march  through june  of approximately  in our results of operations for we can offer no assurances as to how much  if any  of these remaining nrw invoices we will ultimately be able to collect and recognize as revenues 
bulk segment g a expenses for  and were  and  respectively 
the growth in g a expenses from to primarily reflects additional consulting fees in services segment revenues from services provided in were  as compared to  in services revenues increased from to due to approximately million in revenues recognized for the construction of the tynes bay plant in bermuda and the expansion of the north sound plant on behalf of the water authority cayman

g a expenses for the services segment were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase in g a expenses primarily represents incremental expenses incurred by our bermuda operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results net income for the year ended december  was  per share on a fully diluted basis  up from the  per share reported for the year ended december  the earnings improvement for reflects a substantial increase in consolidated gross profit attributable to revenue growth 
consolidated revenues for amounted to  as compared to  for additional revenues were earned by all three business segments as retail sales  bulk sales and services revenues for exceeded those for consistent with the growth in revenues  consolidated gross profit increased from  in to  in please refer to results by segment below for a more detailed discussion of our revenues and gross profit for the year ended december  general and administrative g a expenses were  and  on a consolidated basis for and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in g a expenses for is attributable to personnel costs  which exceeded those for the 
table of contents prior year by approximately million 
the personnel costs for our accounting  engineering and supply chain support office subsidiary in deerfield beach  florida that opened in november grew by approximately  from to and our cayman subsidiaries incurred approximately  more in personnel costs in as a result of incremental hires  pay raises and bonus accruals 
the overall growth in g a expense also reflects increases in depreciation expense  insurance expense and directors expenses of approximately   and  respectively and the other various g a costs for our deerfield beach office  which exceeded those for by approximately  interest expense for was  as compared to  for the greater interest expense for reflects the increase in average outstanding borrowings in which were incurred to complete construction of our blue hills plant in the bahamas and the cessation of the capitalization of interest costs for our blue hills plant upon the commissioning of that plant in july results by segment retail segment revenues generated by our retail water operations were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from to resulted from increased demand in grand cayman  particularly in our seven mile beach service area 
by volume of gallons sold  our retail sales increased in when compared to during our retail sales were adversely affected by the continuing impact of hurricane ivan  which damaged a number of hotel and tourist properties in september  thereby reducing the level of tourism and the demand for water for most of many of the damaged properties have reopened  new properties have been constructed  and consequently water demand in our seven mile beach service area exceeded that for in the retail segment generated  in gross profit of sales  as compared to  of sales in total gross profit for retail sales increased as compared to because of the increased retail water sales 
retail segment gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from to as output and revenues for the retail plants grew at a rate faster than overall plant operating costs  as a significant portion of these costs are relatively fixed 
consistent with prior periods we record all non direct g a expenses in our retail business segment and do not allocate any of these non direct costs to our other two business segments 
retail g a expenses for were  up from the  in retail g a for the personnel costs of our accounting  engineering and supply chain support subsidiary in deerfield beach  florida exceeded those for by approximately  and the other g a expenses for this subsidiary exceeded s by approximately  as this subsidiary commenced its activities in the fourth quarter of the remainder of the growth in g a expenses for the retail segment consists primarily of personnel costs for the other retail segment subsidiaries arising from incremental hires  pay raises and bonuses 
bulk segment bulk water sales for and were  and  respectively 
the growth in bulk sales from to of  or  reflects added production capacity and reduced production penalties at the windsor plant which was temporarily expanded from october to august which increased sales for that plant by  from in addition  we recognized incremental sales of  for attributable to the opening our blue hills plant in july and increased sales of  to our customer  water authority cayman  in the cayman islands 
the bulk water sales includes revenues to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas wsc and the water authority cayman totaling   and   respectively  which represented and of total revenues  respectively 
the gross profit on our bulk water sales declined from of sales for the nine months ended september  to of sales for the year ended december  this decline in overall gross profit from the end of the third quarter to year end represents the impact of approximately million in sales from our blue hills plant during the three months ended december  made at essentially a break even gross margin 
our agreement with the wsc for the blue hills plant contains a non revenue water nrw component that requires us to reduce the amount of water lost by the public water distribution system on new providence island over a one year period by million us gallons 
until such time as we can demonstrate to the wsc that we have achieved this reduction  we are required to provide million us gallons of water per day to the wsc from the blue hills plant at no cost to the 
table of contents wsc 
the costs associated with providing this free water to wsc are significant to overall plant operating costs and greatly reduced the overall gross margin on total water sales from the blue hills plant during the fourth quarter of the lack of gross margin on these sales made by the blue hills facility is attributable to higher operational costs related to plant start up and our current obligations with respect to the nrw reduction component of the blue hills contract 
bulk segment gross profit for was  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  for in total bulk segment gross profit dollars increased as compared to the prior year because of the increased bulk water sales 
gross profit for bulk water sales improved as a percentage of sales from to primarily due to operational efficiencies associated with the use of containerized units in the temporary expansion of the windsor plant and to a lesser extent of the lower valley plant 
bulk segment g a expenses for and were  and  respectively 
the overall increase in bulk g a reflects increases in a variety of expense categories including personnel costs  insurance  and professional fees 
services segment our revenues from services provided were  as compared to  for service revenues rose from to as a result of increased engineering and design fees received from oc bvi in connection with the construction of the bar bay plant 
the gross profit of  for exceeded the gross profit reported for this segment for by  as a result of increased design fees while maintaining relatively fixed operating costs

cw bahamas was not in compliance with the financial covenant of this facility as of december  material commitments  expenditures and contingencies oc bvi contract dispute in october  our affiliate oc bvi notified us that the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands the ministry had asserted a purported right of ownership of the baughers bay plant pursuant to the terms of the water supply agreement between the parties dated may the agreement and had invited oc bvi to submit a proposal for its continued involvement in the production of water at the baughers bay plant in light of the ministry s planned assumption of ownership 
under the terms of the agreement  upon the expiration of the initial seven year term in may  the agreement would automatically be extended for another seven year term unless the ministry provided notice  at least eight months prior to such expiration  of its decision to purchase the plant from oc bvi for approximately million 
in correspondence between the parties from late through early  the ministry indicated that the bvi government was prepared to exercise the option to purchase the plant but would be amenable to negotiating a new water supply agreement  and that it considered the agreement to be in force on a monthly basis until negotiations between the bvi government and oc bvi were concluded 
occasional discussions were held between the parties since without resolution of the matter 
oc bvi has continued to supply water to the ministry and has expended approximately million to significantly expand the production capacity of the plant beyond that contemplated in the agreement 
the ministry is oc bvi s sole customer and substantially all of its revenues are generated from the baughers bay plant 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in income from our equity investment in the earnings of oc bvi 
for those same years  we recognized approximately   and  respectively  in revenues from its management services agreement with oc bvi 
we also 
table of contents recognized approximately   and  in other income for the years ended december   and  respectively  from our profit sharing agreement with oc bvi 
in addition to our loan to  and equity investment in  oc bvi of approximately million  the recorded value of the management services agreement with oc bvi  which is reflected as an intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet  was approximately  as of december  oc bvi owed us approximately  for unpaid management fees and operating advances as of december   which is included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet and was subsequently collected in oc bvi submitted a proposal to the ministry in late to continue to supply water from the baughers bay plant 
the ministry held discussions with oc bvi regarding a new contract but did not formally respond to oc bvi s proposal 
early in the ministry unilaterally took the position that until such time as a new agreement is reached on the ownership of the plant and the price for the water produced by the plant  the ministry would only pay that amount of oc bvi s billings that the ministry purports constitutes oc bvi s costs of producing the water 
at its proposed interim price  the ministry would pay only approximately of the amounts billed by oc bvi pending a new agreement 
oc bvi responded to the ministry that the amount the ministry proposed to pay was significantly less than oc bvi s production costs 
payments made by the ministry to oc bvi since the ministry s assumption of this reduced price have been sporadic and as of december  oc bvi had received payment for less than of the amounts it billed the ministry for the year then ended 
on november   oc bvi issued a demand letter to the bvi government for approximately million representing amounts that oc bvi claimed were due by the bvi government for water sold and delivered plus interest and legal fees 
in response to oc bvi s demand for payment  the bvi government issued a letter dated november  that reasserted its claim that ownership of the baughers bay plant has passed to the bvi government and rejected oc bvi s claim for payment 
oc bvi advised the bvi government in correspondence dated november  that it was demanding that the dispute between oc bvi and the bvi government be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
on the following day  oc bvi s management was informed that the bvi government had filed a lawsuit with the eastern caribbean supreme court seeking ownership of the baughers bay plant 
oc bvi has informed the company that it intends to vigorously pursue its rights to full payment for water sold and delivered to the bvi government and to defend against any action that the bvi government owns any interest in the baughers bay plant and that it believes this dispute will be resolved to its satisfaction 
as of december  oc bvi had million in gross accounts receivable balances due from the bvi government 
in january the bvi government remitted a partial payment on these receivables to oc bvi of million 
if oc bvi continues to experience difficulty in collecting the amounts it invoices to the bvi government  it may be required to defer or reserve for all or a portion of the revenues it invoices but has not yet collected from the bvi government 
should this occur  the income amounts we record from our various oc bvi related assets would decline  and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
during oc bvi completed  for a total cost of approximately million  the construction of a  us gallons per day desalination plant located at bar bay  tortola the bar bay plant 
we provided oc bvi with a million loan to fund part of this plant s construction costs  of which  remained outstanding as of december  principal on this loan is payable in quarterly installments of  with a final balloon payment of million due on august  and interest on the loan is due quarterly at the rate of libor plus 
as of december   oc bvi had failed to make the november scheduled principal payment on the loan but had brought the loan current with respect to all scheduled principal payments as of march oc bvi constructed this plant in response to what it believes is an extreme shortage of  and a pressing demand for  potable water on the eastern end of tortola and anticipated entering into a bulk water supply agreement with the ministry 
however  due to the baughers bay dispute oc bvi had not reached an agreement with the ministry and the bar bay plant had not commenced operations as of march oc bvi has informed us that it met with members of the ministry and others in the bvi government in march and that during this meeting the bvi government expressed its preference to resolve the baughers bay ownership issue without litigation and to enter into negotiations for new water supply agreements with oc bvi on mutually acceptable terms for both the baughers bay and bar bay plants 
oc bvi has also informed us that it believes based upon this meeting that further payments against its outstanding accounts receivables from the bvi government as of december  may be forthcoming in the near future 
we account for our investment in oc bvi in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this accounting pronouncement requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary  and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment 
to test for possible impairment of our investment in oc bvi  we estimated its fair value as of december  in making this estimate  we calculated the expected cash flows from our investment in oc bvi using the guidance set forth under the fasb statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
in accordance with this fasb statement we i identified various 
table of contents possible outcomes of the baughers bay dispute and negotiations for a contract on the new bar bay plant  ii estimated the cash flows associated with each possible outcome  and iii assigned a probability to each outcome based upon discussions held to date by oc bvi s management with the bvi government and oc bvi s legal counsel 
the resulting probability weighted sum represents the expected cash flows  and our best estimate of future cash flows  to be derived from our investment in oc bvi 
we determined that the fair value of our investment in oc bvi  as based upon these expected cash flows  exceeded our carrying value for its investment in oc bvi as of december  and therefore no loss should be recognized on this investment 
the identification of the possible outcomes for the baughers bay dispute and bar bay negotiations  the projections of cash flows for each outcome  and the assignment of relative probabilities to each outcome all represent significant estimates made by us 
the ultimate resolution of the baughers bay and bar bay issues may differ significantly from our estimates and may result in actual cash flows from oc bvi that vary materially from the expected cash flows we used in determining oc bvi s fair value at december  if oc bvi and the bvi government are unable to agree on a new contract for baughers bay and this matter proceeds to resolution through the courts  the ministry s right of ownership under the agreement could be found to be enforceable  in which case oc bvi could lose its water supply arrangement with the ministry or may be forced to accept a water supply arrangement with the ministry on less favorable terms  and if the bvi government exercises its purported right  oc bvi could lose ownership of the baughers bay plant 
even if oc bvi is able to refute the ministry s purported right of ownership  oc bvi may elect to accept a new contract on less favorable terms 
oc bvi may be unsuccessful in negotiating a contract for the bar bay plant on terms it finds acceptable 
any of these or other possible outcomes could result in actual cash flows from our investment in oc bvi that are significantly lower than our estimate 
in such case  we could be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such impairment charge would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
material expenditures and commitments the following table summaries our contractual obligations as of december  and total thereafter secured bonds series a bonds employment agreements operating leases other includes interest costs to be incurred 
secured bonds are shown gross of discount 
in addition to the commitments in the table above  we estimate the costs as of december  to complete the expansion of the governor s harbour and west bay plants on grand cayman to be approximately million 
we further estimate the costs as of december  to complete the construction of the frank sound plant in grand cayman and the tynes bay plant in bermuda to be million 
we project these costs will all be incurred in 
table of contents cw bahamas performance bonds we have two contracts  one for our windsor plant and one for our blue hills plant  to supply water to the water and sewer corporation of the government of the bahamas wsc 
each contract requires us to guarantee delivery of a minimum quantity of water per week 
if we do not meet this minimum  we are required to pay to the wsc for the difference between the minimum and actual gallons delivered at a per gallon rate equal to the price per gallon that wsc is currently paying us under the contract 
the windsor and blue hills contracts expire in and  respectively and require us to deliver million imperial gallons and million imperial gallons  respectively  of water each week 
we are required to provide the wsc with performance and operating guarantees  in the form of bank issued performance bonds  to secure any payments we may be required to make under the minimum delivery requirements of these contracts 
as of december   performance bonds of million and million were outstanding for the windsor and blue hills plant respectively 
cw bermuda financing in january  our recently formed affiliate  cw bermuda  signed a contract with the government of bermuda to design  build and operate a desalination plant at tynes bay on the northern coast of bermuda
