table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those relating to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  litigation and other contingencies  intangible assets and goodwill and share based compensation expense 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
differences between our estimates and the actual results are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the estimate is changed 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates can affect materially the amount of our reported net income or loss 
revenue recognition the company s products enable network operators to efficiently and cost effectively provision and manage multiservice access and optical capacity to support a wide range of converged services such as voice  video and data 
as our customer requirements have been evolving  the software component of our product is becoming more than incidental to its functionality 
accordingly  for such arrangements where software is more than incidental to the functionality of the product  the company recognizes revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
the company will apply the provisions of sop  as amended  to substantially all of its customer arrangements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with sop  the company begins to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met the company has evidence of an arrangement with a customer  the company delivers the products  agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties  and collection is probable 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of sales contracts or agreements and customer purchase orders 
product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
if uncertainties exist regarding customer acceptance  the company recognizes revenue when all uncertainties are resolved 
the company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history to the company 
for arrangements which include the delivery of multiple elements  revenue is allocated for all elements based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value 
vsoe is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or the price is established by management having the relevant authority 
in situations where vsoe exists for all elements delivered and undelivered  the company allocates the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements  based on their relative fair value 
for transactions where vsoe exists only for the undelivered elements  the company uses the residual method and defers the full fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred as revenue 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered items that are services  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the remaining service period 
if vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features  all revenue is deferred until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which vsoe for the undelivered elements is determined 

table of contents revenue from installation or other services is recognized as work is performed or ratably over the service period 
for arrangements in which the software component is incidental to the functionality of the product  the company has recognized revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
for arrangements in which the software component is incidental to the functionality of the product and that involve the delivery or performance of multiple elements  the determination as to how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate deliverables of the arrangement has been determined in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when an arrangement involves multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if fair value does not exist for any undelivered element  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of i the delivery of the undelivered element or ii fair value of the undelivered element exists  unless the undelivered element is a service  in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts 
in the event that we become aware of deterioration in a particular customer s financial condition  a review is performed to determine if additional provisions for doubtful accounts are required 
investments we account for our marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

our investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded as an element of stockholders equity 
the fair value of investments is determined based on quoted market prices at the reporting date for those instruments 
we evaluate our investments for potential impairment on a quarterly basis and would recognize an impairment charge should a decline in the fair value of investments below the related cost basis be judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
warranty obligations we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience a change in warranty claims that vary from historical experience in our costs to provide warranty services  we may be required to adjust our warranty accrual 
a change in the warranty accrual will impact our gross margin 
inventory we continuously monitor inventory balances and record inventory provisions for any excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand  manufacturing quantities and market conditions 
while such assumptions may change from period to period  we measure the net realizable value of inventories using the best information available as of the balance sheet date 
if actual market 
table of contents conditions are less favorable than those projected  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional inventory provisions may be required 
once inventory has been written down to its estimated net realizable value  its carrying value can not be increased due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
accordingly  if inventory previously written down to its net realizable value is subsequently sold  gross profit margins would be favorably impacted 
reserve for contingencies we are subject to various claims  litigation and other disputes  as well as potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims  litigation and tax matters and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  it may be necessary to revise our estimates related to these pending claims  litigation and other disputes and potential liabilities associated with various tax matters 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities are reflected in our results of operations in the period of change and could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
goodwill as of july   the consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
this amount primarily represents the remaining excess of the total purchase price of the eastern research acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  which we have determined to be the last business day of june each year  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal or intangible assets as of july   the consolidated balance sheet included million in other intangible assets  net 
the company accounts for the impairment or disposal of intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas in accordance with sfas  each intangible asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
valuation of our intangible assets requires the company to make assumptions about the estimates of future cash flows  including assumptions related to revenue  operating income  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ or the estimates change  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
such charges would have the effect of decreasing earnings or increasing losses in such period 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company decided to discontinue the development of its acquired ox product  resulting in an asset impairment charge of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to cease further development of its acquired bsg product 
as a result  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred an intangible asset impairment charge of million related to the acquired dnx technology and customer relationships 
the impairment charge was primarily related to lower than previously estimated revenues from our dnx products 
share based compensation expense we account for share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we have estimated the fair value of share based options on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model  which is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions 
table of contents regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
results of operations fiscal years ended july  and revenue the following table presents product and service revenue in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent revenue product service total revenue total revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal product revenue consists primarily of sales of our intelligent bandwidth management solutions 
product revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a significant decline in the level of orders from a major customer 
service revenue consists primarily of fees for services relating to the maintenance of our products  installation services and training 
service revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of service revenue from our access products for the entire current fiscal year compared to a partial year in fiscal and increased core product installation services in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  two customers accounted for and of revenue  or a combined of our total revenue 
two customers accounted for and of revenue in fiscal  or a combined of our total revenue 
international revenue represented of revenue in fiscal  compared to of revenue in fiscal we expect future revenue will continue to be highly concentrated in a relatively small number of customers 
the timing of customer deployments in any given quarter may cause shifts in both the number of greater than customers and in the percentage mix of domestic and international revenue 
the loss of any one of these customers or any substantial reduction or delay in orders by any one of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit the following table presents gross profit for product and services  including non cash share based compensation expense in thousands  except percentages year ended july  gross profit product service total gross profit product service total 
table of contents product gross profit cost of product revenue consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers for purchased materials and services and other internal manufacturing costs 
product gross profit decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to reduced revenue in fiscal caused by a decline in the level of orders from a major customer  and an inventory provision of million booked in fiscal product gross profit percentage increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a shift in customer product mix 
product gross profit may fluctuate from period to period due to revenue fluctuation  volume  pricing pressures resulting from intense competition in our industry as well as the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers 
in addition  product gross profit may be affected by changes in the mix of products sold  channels of distribution  overhead absorption  sales discounts  increases in labor costs  excess inventory and obsolescence charges  increases in component pricing or other material costs  the introduction of new products or the entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 
service gross profit cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs of providing services under customer service contracts which include salaries and related expenses and other fixed costs 
service gross profit remained consistent in fiscal compared to fiscal service gross profit percentage decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a change in the mix of customers and services provided  namely a higher level of installation services  which are at a lower margin  versus maintenance services 
as most of our service cost of revenue is fixed  increases or decreases in revenue will have a significant impact on service gross profit 
service gross profit may be affected in future periods by various factors including  but not limited to  the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services  competitive and economic pricing pressures  the enhanced negotiating leverage of certain larger customers  maintenance contract renewals and the timing of renewals 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses in thousands  except percentages year ended july  variance in dollars variance in percent research and development sales and marketing general and administrative asset impairments in process research and development restructuring and related impairments reserve for contingencies total operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses and prototype costs relating to design  development  testing and enhancements of our products 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased project related costs  including the expansion of our development center in shanghai 
we continue to focus our research and development investments on features and functionality targeted at existing and prospective customer requirements 
we are continuing to invest in r d with a view toward convergence and the next generation of optical products to support it 
we believe that investment in both domestic and off shore r d initiatives will provide a portfolio of products to address an evolving market allowing us to compete more effectively for both near and longer term opportunities 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses  amortization of customer evaluation inventory and other sales and marketing support expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to higher costs in fiscal associated with personnel costs and an employment agreement between the company and a former company executive which resulted in a non cash charge of million arising from the modification of his stock option agreement and lower commissions in fiscal due to lower order levels in fiscal compared to fiscal within our existing spending levels  we continue to allocate sales and marketing resources to those geographic regions where we see the most attractive opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate purposes 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the audit committee s stock option and related accounting investigation 
in fiscal and we recorded expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  in connection with the audit committee s investigation 
asset impairments we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows

the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow model  based on a discount rate which took into consideration the stage of completion and risks associated with developing the technology 

table of contents restructuring and related impairments during the first quarter of  we completed a consolidation of our moorestown  new jersey facility and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this consolidation was completed in conjunction with the decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our workforce by employees across the company

as a result of these actions  we recorded a restructuring charge related to rent and other facility charges related to our moorestown facility 
the charge in first quarter of fiscal also includes severance costs related to several employees affected by the fourth quarter fiscal workforce reduction who were placed on transition programs and whose employment was terminated in the first quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded an additional restructuring charge related to the consolidation of our moorestown facility of million 
the charge was based on a revised lower estimate of future sublease income and a lease termination fee 
it is possible that such actions may be necessary in the future should market and business conditions change 
reserve for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 a liability is recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company reviews the need for any such provision on a quarterly basis and records any necessary adjustments to reflect the effect of ongoing negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case in the period they become known 
we are also subject to tax audits by various tax authorities

therefore  in accordance with the requirements of fasb  we maintain a full valuation allowance 
if we generate sustained future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed 
if the valuation allowance were reversed  a portion would be recorded as an increase to paid in capital  a reduction to goodwill and the remainder would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and as a result  are effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal however  the fasb has recently approved a one year deferral for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the company has evaluated the potential impact of the sfas on its consolidated financial statements and has determined that the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require certain assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value
