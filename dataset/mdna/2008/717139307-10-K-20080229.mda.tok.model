item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to unknown risks  uncertainty and other factors that may cause results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the results for the year ended december  and were a net loss of million and million or a loss per share of 
and  respectively 
the operating expenses for were million  primarily comprised of million research and development expenses primarily relating to the commencement of the dextofisopam phase b clinical trial  and million of general and administration expenses 
in the company commenced the dextofisopam phase b clinical trial with randomized patients enrolled as of december  of an anticipated patient trial 
general and administrative expenses included severance payments aggregations  relating to the departure of three senior executives 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the listing below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to stock based compensation  tax valuation allowance and asset impairments to be critical policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
equity based compensation effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based compensation plans 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock units  and employee stock purchases related to the espp 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period of the entire award generally the vesting period of the award 
the company has elected to expense these awards on a straight line basis over the life of the awards 
as a result of adopting sfas r  the company s net loss before income taxes and net loss for the years ended december  and were  and  more than if the company had continued to account for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and its related interpretations 
basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december  and of and are and more as a result of adopting sfas r 
the company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r and  therefore  financial results for prior periods have not been restated 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and include expense for all equity awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to january  was based on the grant date fair value determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized compensation expense of  and  for stock options which were recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december  and  the total compensation costs related to non vested awards not yet recognized is  which will be recognized over the next three and one quarter years 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with apb and also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas under apb  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method as allowed under sfas the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation 
the estimated fair value of each option is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
year ended december  net loss as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards pro forma net loss loss per share basic and diluted  as reported basic and diluted  pro forma for disclosure purposes under sfas no 
 the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumption risk free interest rate expected lives in years dividend yield expected volatility on june   the company accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options awarded under its stock option plans that had exercise prices greater than  the closing price was on june  unvested options to purchase approximately  shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
typically  the company grants stock options that vest over a four year period 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the company to avoid recognizing  in its consolidated statement of operations  compensation expense associated with these options in future periods  upon adoption of sfas r share based payment in january the impact of this acceleration resulted in a million increase in proforma stock based compensation expense in options issued to non employees other than directors are accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the option based on the value of the award using the black scholes method 
compensation cost is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest in accordance with eitf issue no 
and is recognized over the service period 
on september   the board of directors approved the retention award agreements and pharmos entered into retention award agreements with each of dr 
haim aviv  its then chairman and chief executive officer  and dr 
gad riesenfeld  its then president and chief operating officer 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock units to dr 
aviv 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock to dr 
riesenfeld the awards 
under the agreement  one half of the awards vested on december  and the balance shall vest and become non forfeitable on june   subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions 
under the terms of dr 
riesenfeld s severance agreement  the balance of his awards vested on his departure from the company on april  and the expense of those awards was accelerated through april  the fair value of the restricted shares was based on the fair value of the stock on the issuance date 
the aggregate fair value of the restricted stock awards totaled million 
for financial reporting purposes  the cash awards and the fair value of the restricted stock awards  which totaled  will be expensed pro rata over the vesting periods 
per the awards  only dr 
riesenfeld was issued the restricted stock  dr 
aviv received restricted stock units 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in the reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets and would increase our net loss in the period in which the charge arose 
tax valuation allowance the company has assessed the likelihood of realizing future taxable income and has determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income or decrease the loss in the period such determination is made

investing activities in  the company purchased short term investments that were typically auction rate securities and investments that mature between days and one year 
short term investments are reinvested upon maturity to the extent that the funds are not needed to meet operating activity cash flow needs 
in  the company received million in short term investment proceeds and reinvested million in short term investments 
the company considers all investments that are not considered cash equivalents and with a maturity of less than one year from the balance sheet date to be short term investments 
the company considers all investments with a maturity of greater than one year to be long term investments 
all investments are considered as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost  as the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
the company invests in a variety of instruments such as commercial paper  us government securities and corporate securities with an effective maturity of less than one year 
some of the company s investments are in auction rate securities ars that are held as investments available for sale 
auction rate securities are instruments with long term underlying maturities  but for which an auction is conducted periodically  as specified  to reset the interest rate and allow investors to buy or sell the instruments 
because auctions generally occur more often than annually  and because the company holds these instruments in order to meet short term liquidity needs  the auction rate securities are classified as short term investments in the consolidated balance sheet 
interest income includes interest  amortization of investment purchases premiums and discounts  and realized gains and losses on sales of securities 
realized gains and losses on sales of investment securities are determined based on the specific identification method 
the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects the gross amount of the purchases of short term investments and the proceeds from maturities of short term securities and sales of auction rate securities 
at december  we held  in auction rate securities ars 
at february  we had only one remaining ars 
the one remaining ars  issued by george washington university  is for  the reset auction for this security failed to clear on february  an auction failure occurs when the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
this ars  a general obligation of george washington university  was reset at the maximum rate  as defined and is backed by student loans 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings 
deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year  and currently believe this security is not impaired  primarily due to insurance covering the investment  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying note up to years to realize our investment s recorded value 
based on our current cash balances  and other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on this investment will affect our ability to execute our current business plan

new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards except for measurements of share based payments and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of sfas will change current practice 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

currently  under fasb statement no 
 accounting for research and development costs  nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities for materials  equipment  facilities  and purchased intangible assets that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
eitf addresses whether such non refundable advance payments for goods or services that have no alternative future use and that will be used or rendered for research and development activities should be expensed when the advance payments are made or when the research and development activities have been performed 
the consensus reached by the fasb requires companies involved in research and development activities to capitalize such non refundable advance payments for goods and services pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement because the right to receive those services in the future represents a probable future economic benefit 
those advance payments will be capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
entities will be required to evaluate whether they expect the goods or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment will be charged to expense 
the consensus on eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is not permitted 
entities are required to recognize the effects of applying the guidance in eitf prospectively for new contracts entered into after the effective date 
the company is in the process of evaluating the expected impact of eitf on its financial position and results of operations following adoption
