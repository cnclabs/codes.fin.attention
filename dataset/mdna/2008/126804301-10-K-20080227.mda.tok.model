the primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores  purchases of inventory  investments in our management information systems and infrastructure  purchases of economic development bonds related to the construction of new retail stores  and general working capital needs 
we historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations  borrowing under revolving credit facilities  issuing debt and equity securities  obtaining economic development grants from state and local governments in connection with developing our retail stores  collecting principal and interest payments on our economic development bonds  and from the retirement of economic development bonds 
retail and direct business segments the cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal  with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from april through november 
while we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities  other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods 
these sources historically have included short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets 
while we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods  if any disruption occurred to our funding sources  or if we underestimated our cash needs  we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness  which could result in reduced revenue and profits 
financial services business segment the bank the primary cash requirements of our bank relate to the financing of credit card loans 
the bank sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities  which include funding obtained from securitization transactions  borrowing under its credit agreement or federal funds purchase agreements  accepting certificates of deposit  and generating cash from operations 
the bank is prohibited by regulations from lending money to cabela s or other affiliates 
the bank is subject to capital requirements imposed by nebraska banking law and the visa membership rules  and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by nebraska and federal banking law 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital available from cash on hand  our revolving credit facility  and other borrowing sources to fund our cash requirements and near term growth plans 
operating  investing and financing activities the following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended in thousands net cash derived from operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  versus operating activities cash derived from operating activities decreased million for compared to this net decrease in cash was primarily due to a net change of million in inventories  as inventory balances increased million over due to more new store openings in the inventory increase was funded by accounts payable  which had a net increase of million compared to the net increase in accounts payable was impacted by a million decrease compared to due to a decrease in the payable to the third party processor for the bank s credit card transactions 
in addition  land held for sale or development was up million over as we increased our holdings in land investment 
these uses of cash from operating activities were partially offset by an million net increase between years related to the bank s funding from securitization transactions

in addition  depreciation and amortization increased million offsetting cash used in operating activities 
we will incur a total cash outlay of approximately million over four years based on our election in our federal income tax return to change our method of accounting for inventory from lifo to fifo for income tax purposes 
at the end of  we owed approximately million  which is included in the current portion of deferred income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million for compared to this net increase was primarily due to expenditures related to the development and construction of new retail stores in for  cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled million

the notes have a final maturity of years and an average life of seven years 
we intend to use the proceeds to pay down existing debt and for general corporate purposes

financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in compared with cash used of million in this net increase in cash was primarily due to the debt issuance of million in february to support our retail store expansion and the net increase of million in short term borrowings and inventory financing 
partially offsetting this increase were decreases in time deposits of million 
grants and economic development bonds in the past  we have negotiated economic development arrangements relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores  including free land  monetary grants  and the recapture of incremental sales  property  or other taxes through economic development bonds  with many local and state governments 
we design our retail stores to provide exciting tourist and entertainment shopping experiences for the entire family 
our retail stores also employ many people from the local community  draw customer traffic from a broad geographic range  and serve as a catalyst for the opening of additional retail businesses such as restaurants  hotels  and gas stations in the surrounding areas 
we believe these factors increase the revenue for the state and the local municipality where the retail store is located  making us a compelling partner for community development and expansion 
where appropriate  we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores 
grants we generally have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding 
the commitments  such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open  typically phase out over approximately five to years 
if we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period  the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise  which could affect our cash flows and profitability 
as of december   the total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was million 
economic development bonds through economic development bonds  the state or local government sells bonds to provide funding for land acquisition  readying the site  building infrastructure and related eligible expenses associated with the construction and equipping of our retail stores 
in the past  we have primarily been the sole purchaser of these bonds 
the bond proceeds that are received by the governmental entity are then used to fund the construction and equipping of new retail stores and related infrastructure development 
while purchasing these bonds involves an initial cash outlay by us in connection with a new store  some or all of these costs can be recaptured through the repayments of the bonds 
the payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales  property  or lodging taxes generated from the store and  in some cases  from businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
in addition  some of the bonds that we have purchased may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
after purchasing the bonds  we typically record them on our consolidated balance sheet classified as available for sale and value them based upon management s projections of the amount of tax revenue expected to be generated to support principal and interest payments on the bonds 
because of the unique features of each project  there is no independent market data for valuation of these types of bonds 
if sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties  we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   million of economic development bonds were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the negotiation of these economic development arrangements has been important to our retail store expansion in the past  and these arrangements may be an important factor in our retail store expansion strategy in certain locations because they allow us to avoid or recapture a portion of the costs involved with opening a new store 
securitization of credit card loans our financial services business historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program 
asset securitization is a practice commonly used by credit card issuers to fund credit card loans at attractive rates 
the bank enters into asset securitization transactions  which involve the two tier sale of a pool of credit card loans from the bank to a wholly owned special purpose entity  and from that wholly owned special purpose entity to a second special purpose entity that is organized as a trust 
the trust is administered by an independent trustee 
because the trust qualifies as a qualified special purpose entity within the meaning of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet in accordance with fas the trust issues to outside investors various forms of certificates and notes each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the trust 
the trust pays to the holders of the certificates and notes a portion of future scheduled cash flows under preset terms and conditions  the receipt of which is dependent upon cash flows generated by the underlying performance of the assets of the trust 
we retain a transferor s interest in the securitized loans  which ranks equal with the investor certificates and notes  an interest only strip  which represent the right to receive excess cash available after repayment of all amounts to the investors  servicing rights  cash reserve accounts in some cases and class b securities in one of the securitizations 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against us beyond the assets of the trust  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants and minimum account balance levels which must be maintained to support our retained interests 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and the related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the loans 
we record our interest only strips as an asset at fair value  which is an amount equal to the estimated present value of cash flows to be received by us over the expected outstanding period of the loans 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of the amounts paid to certificate and note holders  credit losses  and servicing and administration fees 
we use certain valuation assumptions related to the average lives of the loans sold and anticipated credit losses  as well as the appropriate market discount rate  in determining the estimated present value of the interest only strips 
changes in the average life of the loans sold  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could adversely impact the actual value of the interest only strips 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
gains on securitization transactions  fair value adjustments  and earnings on our securitizations are included in consolidated revenue in the consolidated statement of income  and the cash reserve accounts  class b securities  and the interest only strips are included on our consolidated balance sheet as retained interests in securitized loans 
all of the bank s securitization transactions are currently accounted for as sale transactions 
as a result  the loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  other than our transferor s interest  cash reserve accounts  class b securities and interest only strips 
a credit card loan represents a financial asset 
unlike a mortgage or other closed end loan account  the terms of a credit card account permit a customer to borrow additional amounts and to repay each month an amount the customer chooses  subject to a monthly minimum payment requirement 
the credit card account remains open after repayment of the balance and the customer may continue to use it to borrow additional amounts 
we reserve the right to change the credit card account terms  including interest rates and fees  in accordance with the terms of the credit card agreement and applicable law 
the credit card account is  therefore  separate and distinct from the loan 
in a credit card securitization  the credit card account relationships are not sold to the securitization entity 
we retain ownership of the credit card account relationship  including the right to change the terms of the credit card account 
we sell our credit card loans in the ordinary course of business through a commercial paper conduit program and longer term fixed and floating rate securitization transactions 
in a conduit securitization  our credit card loans are converted into securities and sold to commercial paper issuers  which pool the securities with those of other issuers 
the amount securitized in a conduit structure is allowed to fluctuate within the terms of the facility  which may provide greater flexibility for liquidity needs 
the total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of december   were as follows initial series type amount interest rate expected final maturity dollars in thousands series term  floating january series i term  fixed march series ii term  floating march series i term  fixed october series i term  floating october series iii term  fixed october series iii term  floating october series i variable funding  floating october the trust entered into an agreement to convert the floating rate certificate into a fixed rate obligation 
on january   the trust completed a million securitization series i 
this securitization refinanced the million securitization that matured january  with the remainder funding continued growth of the bank s credit card portfolio 
includes a temporary increase of million that expires in march we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for our financial services segment 
a failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow our financial services business 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  such as financial guaranty insurance  could have a similar effect 
furthermore  poor performance of our securitized credit card loans  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds  could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in our securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
this could jeopardize our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms  decrease our liquidity  and force us to rely on other potentially more expensive funding sources  to the extent available  which would decrease our profitability 
certificates of deposit we utilize certificates of deposit to partially finance the operating activities of our bank 
our bank issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities 
as of december   we had million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from january to april and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years 
we cannot assure  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations at the end of thereafter total in thousands long term debt      short term borrowings   interest payments        capital lease obligations        operating leases        time deposits by maturity      obligations under new store and expansion arrangements     purchase obligations     deferred compensation   unrecognized tax benefits   total      includes million owed under our million credit agreement  and million owed under our million credit agreement for operations in canada 
excludes amounts owed under capital lease obligations 
these amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facilities because the amount that will be borrowed under these facilities in future years is uncertain 
at december   obligations for new store and expansion arrangements include approximately million of estimated contractual obligations associated with the completion of our store expansion obligations  two retail stores scheduled to open in and two in  and certain obligations under economic development bonds 
the table does not include any amounts for contractual obligations associated with retail store locations where we are in the process of certain negotiations 
our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory  shipping  and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts 
the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding at the end of under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders  or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable laws  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less 
the following tables provide summary information concerning other commercial commitments at the end of in thousands letters of credit  standby letters of credit  revolving line of credit for boat and atv inventory  open account document instructions  bank federal funds total  our credit agreement allows for maximum borrowings of million including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
at december   the total amount available for borrowing under this revolving line of credit  including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit  was million 
our credit agreement for operations in canada is for million  with million available for borrowing at december  the line of credit for boat and atv financing is limited by the aforementioned million revolving line of credit to million of secured collateral 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is million 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease various items of office equipment and buildings 
rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling  distribution  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table 
credit card limits the bank bears off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business 
one form of this risk is through the bank s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits 
the aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled billion above existing balances as of december  these funding obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
while the bank has not experienced  and does not anticipate that it will experience  a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders  a significant draw down would create a cash need at the bank which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources 
the bank has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time 
securitizations all of the bank s securitization transactions have been accounted for as sales transactions and the credit card loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of cabela s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions 
our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates 
should actual results be different than our estimates  we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that are material 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below are our accounting policies that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise revenue recognition revenue is recognized on our internet and catalog sales when merchandise is delivered to customers at the point of delivery  with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer 
we recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations 
sales of gift certificates and gift cards gift instruments are recorded in revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise and as a liability prior to redemption 
had our estimate of merchandise in transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
we record breakage on gift instruments gift instruments never presented for merchandise as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote 
had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by of the recorded liability at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
inventories we estimate provisions for inventory shrinkage  damaged goods returned values  and obsolete and slow moving items based on historical loss and product performance statistics and future merchandising objectives 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future impacting these estimates  actual losses can be higher or lower based on future merchandising decisions and retail economic trends 
had our estimated inventory reserves been different by at the end of  our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
catalog costs deferred catalog costs consist of incremental internal and third party direct costs incurred in the development  production  and circulation of our direct mail catalogs  composed principally of creative design  prepress production  paper  printing  postal  and mailing costs 
deferred catalog costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit or twelve months  whichever is shorter  based upon sales forecasts developed using historical sales for similar catalog offerings 
deferred catalog expenses are evaluated for recoverability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to actual sales data and to projected future cash flows 
had our amortization estimate of deferred catalog costs been different by for  our catalog costs expense would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
economic development bonds we record economic development bonds based on estimates of the discounted future cash payments to be received under these bonds 
these estimates are also the basis for our recognition of deferred grant revenue to be received under the economic development grants as an offset to construction costs which is amortized over the asset lives of the development 
these cash flow estimates are dependent on property and or sales tax collections derived from our operations  and potentially other businesses  some of which may be in the development stage 
had our fair value estimates been lower by as of the end of  the value of economic development bonds reflected in our consolidated financial statements would have been approximately million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income loss if the loss was deemed to be temporary 
any declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method 
asset securitization we securitize the majority of our credit card loans  and recognize gains or losses on the sales  as well as record certain retained interests including seller s transferor s interest  interest only strips  and cash reserve accounts  which are all subject to significant valuation assumptions 
the interests in securitized receivables  including the transferor s interest  interest only strips  and cash reserve accounts  are reported at fair value or cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
certain estimates used in the determinations of gains on sales  and the related fair values of the asset accounts  are influenced by factors outside of our control  and as a result  such estimates could materially change in the near term 
on a quarterly basis  we review and adjust  as appropriate  the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the related accounts recognized in connection with the our securitization transactions 
if these assumptions change  or actual results differ from projected results  asset balances and securitization income would be affected 
if we had made different assumptions for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements  our financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
certain of these assumptions and estimates will change in the future with changes in market and economic conditions 
for example  rates paid to investors  as well as projected interest income  are primarily variable rates which change with market interest rate changes  and loan payment rates could fluctuate based on general economic conditions 
changes in these factors may result in future estimates of the excess spread and payment rates being materially different from the estimates used in refer to note for the sensitivity analysis of the current fair value of retained interests and the impact on fair value from an immediate adverse change of and in the key economic assumptions used to determine fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our bank s operations and  to a lesser extent  through our merchandising operations 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations 
financial services interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings or the net present value of assets and off balance sheet positions  less liabilities termed economic value of equity due to interest rate changes 
to the extent that interest income collected on managed credit card loans and interest expense do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that rates do not change uniformly  securitization earnings and economic value of equity could be affected 
our net interest income on managed credit card loans is affected primarily by changes in short term interest rate indices such as london inter bank offered rate libor and the prime rate 
the variable rate credit card loans are indexed to the prime rate 
securitization certificates and notes are indexed to libor based rates of interest and are periodically repriced 
certificate of deposits are priced at the current prevailing market rate at the time of issuance 
we manage and mitigate our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques  but primarily by modifying the contract terms with our cardholders  including interest rates charged  in response to changing market conditions 
additional techniques we use include managing the maturity  repricing  and distribution of assets and liabilities by issuing fixed rate securitization certificates and notes  and by entering into interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate exposure from interest strips 
the table below shows the mix of our credit card account balances at the years ended as a percentage of total balances outstanding balances carrying interest rate based upon the national prime lending rate balances carrying an interest rate of balances carrying an interest rate of balances not carrying interest because their previous month s balance was paid in full charges on the credit cards issued by our financial services segment are priced at a margin over the defined national prime lending rate  subject to certain interest rate floors 
however  purchases of cabela s merchandise  certain other charges  and balance transfer programs are financed at a fixed interest rate of 
together  the balances on these credit cards represent of total balances outstanding at the end of no interest is charged if the account is paid in full within days of the billing cycle  which represent of total balances outstanding 
credit card balances with a zero percentage interest rate have increased over prior years due to an increase in promotional merchandise offers 
management has performed an interest rate gap analysis to measure the effects of the timing of the repricing of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
based on this analysis  we believe that if there had been an immediate basis point  or  increase in the market rates for which our assets and liabilities are indexed during the next twelve months  our projected operating results would not be materially affected 
management also has performed a projected interest rate gap analysis for the same future twelve month period to measure the effects of a change in the spread between the prime interest rate and the libor interest rate 
based on this analysis  we believe that an immediate spread decrease of basis point  or  would cause a pre tax decrease to income of million  and an immediate spread increase of basis points would cause a pre tax increase to income of million on our financial services segment over the next twelve months  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
merchandising business interest rate risk one of our economic development bond agreements  priced at a variable interest rate  had a portion of those bonds retired in june  and the interest rates were renegotiated 
the remaining million of these particular economic development bonds were redeemed in full in april the interest payable on our line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt increased  our interest expense and results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the united states in transactions that are primarily u 
s 
dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the u 
s 
dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
a decline in the relative value of the u 
s 
dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased merchandise costs 
for our retail store in canada  we intend to fund all transactions in canadian dollars  and we will utilize our unsecured revolving credit agreement for million to fund such operations
