the aggregate cash purchase price for jdk was million 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for each of these acquisitions  the purchase price was entirely funded through our available cash reserves  except the acquisition of atp which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
the results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements since their respective acquisition dates 
accordingly  our consolidated net sales for the years ended november    and include the following amounts related to these acquired businesses in thousands emf atp jdk for operating segment purposes  emf is reported within our microwave components and systems business segment 
atp and jdk comprise our recently created sensors and controls business segment 
asset impairment loss in august  our  square foot ceramic manufacturing facility in new orleans  louisiana  was severely damaged by hurricane katrina and related flooding the hurricane 
as a result of the hurricane  we recorded net asset impairment losses and related expenses of  in the year ended november  this amount  which has been included in general and administrative expense in fiscal  consists of the following inventory losses of million  building and equipment losses of million including the reduction of the affected land and building to its estimated fair value of  direct clean up  asset assessment  and repair costs of million  less expected insurance proceeds of million 
in march  we sold the land and building in new orleans at a net selling price of  as a result  we recorded an additional asset impairment loss of  representing the difference between the net selling price and the property s previously estimated fair value of  in  we also incurred final clean up and asset assessment costs of  accordingly  an asset impairment loss in the aggregate amount of  has been included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended november  as of november   we had received million of insurance proceeds for our hurricane related claims  and we had recorded an insurance recovery receivable of million for expected additional insurance proceeds 
in january  we received insurance proceeds of million upon the final settlement of all related claims 
accordingly   was credited against our general and administrative expense in the year ended november   representing the excess of the final insurance proceeds received over the previously recorded insurance recovery receivable

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued executive summary during  our consolidated net sales increased by million or from this increase was principally driven by our recent business acquisitions 
sales of our sensors and controls grew to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
in addition to atp product sales increases of million  the current year sales growth for these products reflects increased shipments of our custom position sensors and related assemblies  which are used in numerous military and commercial applications 
including emf product sales of million  sales of our microwave components and systems were down slightly at million in and million in  as certain major military defense programs were going through a transition period of renewal or replacement 
during the second half of fiscal  we expect our microwave products to resume their historical positive growth rate 
sales of our signal and power integrity products were million in  up million or from a year ago  primarily reflecting improved overall market conditions 
also  early in fiscal  our signal integrity product sales were negatively impacted by the aftermath of hurricane katrina and our inability to obtain the ceramic components necessary to complete certain signal product orders 
total consolidated customer orders received in fiscal were million  an increase of million or from fiscal our gross margin was million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in our improved gross margin percentage primarily reflects reduced ceramic component costs 
after losing our new orleans ceramic manufacturing facility to hurricane katrina in august of  we began purchasing ceramic components from third party suppliers at prices significantly greater than our previous manufactured costs 
as a result  our material costs increased and our gross margin  as a percentage of sales  decreased below historical levels 
to re establish our own ceramic manufacturing capabilities  and replace the operations previously conducted in new orleans  we acquired in december a facility in state college  pennsylvania 
in june  limited ceramic component production commenced at our new state college operations with additional production being systematically increased thereafter 
during the second quarter of fiscal  full ceramic production was achieved and substantially all purchases of specialty ceramic components from third party suppliers were eliminated 
accordingly  as a percentage of sales  our gross margin in the second half of fiscal returned to a more normalized level of to of sales 
with our greater sales volume and improved gross margin  our overall profitability significantly increased 
net income was million or cents per share diluted in  compared to million or cents per share diluted in as a result of our enhanced profitability  net cash provided by operating activities grew to million in fiscal in addition to this positive operating cash flow  we received million in cash from the exercise of employee stock options and million upon the final settlement of all insurance claims related to hurricane katrina 
this aggregate cash generation enabled us to repay million of borrowings under our domestic line of credit  expend million for capital equipment and improvements  as well as fund the million cash purchase price for emf 
at november   our cash and cash equivalents were million  our current ratio was to  and our total debt to equity was to 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  as a percentage of net sales  for the years ended november    and net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expense income from operations other income expense interest expense other income and expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by reportable operating segments for the years ended november    and in thousands signal and power integrity components microwave components and systems power management systems sensors and controls compared to net sales in  our net sales increased by million or  with consolidated sales of million in and million in of this million increase  million relates to our acquisitions of emf and atp 
the remaining million increase reflects additional shipments of signal and power integrity components  power management systems  and sensors and controls  which were partially offset by reduced shipments of microwave products 
sales of our signal and power integrity products were million in fiscal  up million from a year ago  primarily reflecting improved overall market conditions 
additionally  early in fiscal  our signal integrity product sales were negatively impacted by the aftermath of hurricane katrina and our inability to obtain the ceramic components necessary to complete certain signal product orders 
sales of our sensors and controls were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal in addition to atp product sales increases of million  the current year growth in sensor sales principally reflects increased shipments of our custom position sensors used in various medical  commercial weather instruments  and military applications 
sales of our power management systems increased by  with sales of million in and million in we continue to be optimistic about the long term growth potential of these advanced systems  which are used in various infrastructure equipment including voice over internet protocol voip equipment  data storage  unmanned military transport equipment  wireless base stations  and switching gear 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued including emf product sales of million  fiscal year sales of our microwave components and systems were down from a year ago million in versus million in as certain major military related programs were winding down and not yet fully renewed or replaced with the next generation of products 
we currently believe this program transition period will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal accordingly  we expect our microwave components and systems to resume their positive historical growth rate during the second half of next year 
total customer orders received in amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
at november   our sales order backlog was million 
overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in for all of our major product lines 
gross margin our gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales a year ago 
this increase in gross margin percentage principally reflects reduced material costs from the resumption of internal ceramic manufacturing 
total material costs including ceramic components amounted to million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or of sales in fiscal prior to its destruction by hurricane katrina in late august of  our new orleans operations designed and manufactured specialty ceramic capacitors 
these custom ceramic components are an essential element of our signal integrity products 
with this disruption to our internal ceramic manufacturing capabilities  we began purchasing these ceramic components from third party suppliers at prices significantly greater than our previous manufactured costs 
to address our ongoing ceramic component needs and to re establish our own ceramic manufacturing capabilities  we acquired in december a ceramic manufacturing facility in state college  pennsylvania 
the acquired facility has become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic products  replacing the operations previously conducted in new orleans 
in june  limited production commenced at our new state college operations with additional production being systematically increased thereafter 
during the second quarter of fiscal  full ceramic production was achieved and substantially all purchases of specialty ceramic components from third party suppliers were eliminated 
accordingly  as a percentage of sales  our gross margin in the second half of fiscal returned to a more normalized level of to of sales 
total labor costs were million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in in addition to greater sales volume and changes in product mix  the increase in labor costs primarily reflects our resumption of internal ceramic production 
as a percentage of sales  manufacturing overhead remained relatively stable throughout the period 
aggregate manufacturing overhead was million or of sales in fiscal  versus million or of sales in fiscal at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  up from a year ago 
we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to enhance operating efficiencies  while maintaining flexibility for future capacity expansion 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
general and administrative expense was million in versus million in this decrease in general and administrative expense was driven by numerous factors  including the following  associated with asset impairments from hurricane katrina  reflecting the difference between the aggregate asset impairment loss of  recorded in fiscal and the  credit to general and administrative expense realized in fiscal upon the settlement of all related insurance claims  pre production start up costs of  recognized in in connection with our state college facility  and  of additional equity based compensation expense recorded in from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
these decreases to general and administrative expense were partially offset in by additional professional fees of  associated with our initial year compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to million  with an average interest rate of and maximum month end borrowings of million 
during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under the domestic line of credit were million  with an average interest rate of and maximum month end borrowings of million 
other income and expense we hold several united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology  and we have granted several licenses to other entities for the use of pml technology 
in connection with our pml technology  we received license fee and royalty income of  in and  in it is not known what remaining commercial value  if any  our pml licenses may have 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign currency transaction net losses of  in and net gains of  in were recognized and included in nonoperating income and expense 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions  foreign income tax rates  changes in estimated tax rates applied to temporary differences  and the us domestic manufacturers deduction 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  compared to net sales in  our net sales increased by million or from of this million increase  million was in sensors and control products  reflecting our recent acquisitions of atp and jdk 
sales of microwave components and systems grew by million in fiscal  primarily arising from increased shipments for products used in numerous military applications including counter electronic devices  military aircraft and vehicles  and secure communications 
sales of our signal and power integrity components were million in fiscal year  up million from the preceding year  reflecting improved overall market conditions throughout the passive electronic components industry 
in addition  as a result of hurricane katrina and its related disruption of our internally manufactured ceramic components  approximately million of signal product shipments were delayed as of the end of fiscal sales of our power management systems declined by  in fiscal  as certain of our communication equipment customers worked through excess inventories 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total customer orders received in fiscal amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
at november   our sales order backlog was million  up million or from the end of fiscal overall  average selling prices remained relatively stable in for all of our major product lines 
gross margin after losing our new orleans ceramic manufacturing facility to hurricane katrina  we had to purchase specialty ceramic components from third party suppliers throughout fiscal the purchase cost of these ceramic components was significantly greater than our previous manufactured cost 
as a result of these higher material costs  our gross margin declined as a percentage of sales 
in fiscal  our gross margin was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal total material costs including ceramic components amounted to million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in as a percentage of sales  labor and manufacturing overhead declined slightly in fiscal aggregate labor and manufacturing overhead expenses were of sales in  versus of sales in  principally reflecting economies of scale achieved with higher sales volume 
at november   we had a total workforce of  employees  up from the end of fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense selling expense amounted to million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense primarily arises from reductions in advertising and other discretionary expenditures 
as a percentage of sales  the decline in selling expense principally reflects the impact of leveraging certain fixed selling expenses over higher sales volume 
general and administrative expense was million in  versus million in this increase of million includes pre production start up costs of  associated with our recently acquired state college facility   of equity based compensation expense from our adoption of sfas no 
r  and asset impairment losses of  associated with our former new orleans ceramic facility  in excess of losses recorded in fiscal year the balance of the increase in general and administrative expense reflects various expenditures related to our greater business activity 
interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal  up  from fiscal this increase primarily reflects our short term borrowings 
during the year ended november   weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to million  with an average interest rate of and maximum month end borrowings of million 
these borrowings substantially financed our acquisition of atp  as well as certain working capital requirements 
throughout  no borrowings were outstanding under our domestic line of credit arrangement 
other income and expense in  other income and expense consists of interest income from short term investments of  pml license and royalty fee income of  and net gains on foreign currency transactions of  in  other income and expense reflects  of interest income   of pml license and royalty fee income  and net losses on foreign currency transactions of

based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  risk factors that may affect future results military aircraft  naval vessels  and certain military vehicles contain extensive communications equipment  electronic countermeasure equipment for defense against enemy weapons  smart weapons and munitions  and radar systems 
we provide low pass filters  multisection assemblies  and various microwave components and integrated assemblies to major equipment manufacturers for installation into these systems 
in addition  our precision position sensors are used in numerous military vehicles and aircraft 
in  military defense sales were approximately of our total consolidated sales 
in recent years  demand for our products has been favorably impacted by an upward trend in us defense spending 
future defense budgets  however  may be impacted by numerous economic and political factors 
in addition  the specific programs in which we participate  or in which we may seek to participate in the future  must compete with other programs for consideration during the budget formulation and appropriation processes 
while we believe many of our products are used in high priority military defense programs  one or more of the programs that we currently serve could be phased out or terminated 
reductions in these existing programs  unless offset by other programs and opportunities  would adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 
in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were to customers in the communications equipment industry 
our five largest customers in this sector  original equipment manufacturers of communications equipment  represented of our total consolidated net sales in several years ago  capital expenditures for wireless infrastructure equipment by service providers declined dramatically 
market conditions in the industry remain unpredictable and overall capital spending for wireless infrastructure equipment is still volatile 
if the current market conditions deteriorate  it will have a material negative impact on our future operating performance 
raw materials used in the manufacture of certain ceramic capacitors include silver  palladium  and platinum 
precious metals are available from many sources  however  their prices may be subject to significant fluctuations and such fluctuations may have a material and adverse affect on our operating results 
in addition  our results of operations may be negatively affected in the future by a variety of other factors including time delays and cost overages in conducting specialty ceramic capacitor manufacturing at our new state college facilities  competitive pricing pressures  new technologies which decrease the demand for our products  new product offerings by our competitors  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  cancellation of existing customer order backlog  unanticipated impairment of assets  difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and product lines  and changes in product mix 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we maintain a domestic line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania the bank  in the aggregate amount of million  with an additional million expansion feature 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property  and bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   million was outstanding under this line of credit arrangement 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability  and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the current line of credit agreement expires in december our ability to borrow in the future under this bank credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  at november   current assets were times current liabilities  compared to at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal the increase in our working capital and current ratio in was primarily driven by growth in our accounts receivable and inventories from additional sales volume and production requirements  as well as a reduction of million in our short term bank borrowings 
in  the reduction in our working capital and current ratio principally reflects million of net cash purchase price for our acquisition of atp  which was substantially funded through borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
our net working capital and current ratio also decreased in because of the cash requirements associated with the acquisition of land  building and equipment in connection with our new ceramic manufacturing facility in state college  pennsylvania 
our working capital and current ratio decreased in  primarily reflecting the impact of acquiring businesses and their related long lived assets by utilizing some of our cash reserves 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  including million for the acquisition of a machining center used in our sensors and controls business 
the balance of our capital expenditures primarily relate to manufacturing capacity expansion and building improvements at our state college operations 
excluding the assets acquired from atp  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in of these capital expenditures  million relate to our state college operations with the remaining capital expenditures principally supporting manufacturing capacity expansion in our microwave business 
aggregate capital expenditures were million in fiscal  primarily related to building improvements and production equipment for our china manufacturing operations  as well as expanding capacity and improving efficiencies in our microwave business 
in connection with the fixed assets destroyed or damaged by hurricane katrina  we received insurance proceeds of million in and million in at november   we had not entered into any material commitments for additional capital expenditures 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of emf 
the net cash purchase price for emf was million  which was primarily funded by existing cash reserves 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of atp  with the net cash purchase price of million being substantially funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit 
in fiscal year  we consummated two business acquisitions 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of jdk in october in addition  early in  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of amplifonix  inc a designer and manufacturer of microwave components and systems 
the total net cash purchase price for these fiscal acquired businesses was million  which was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
no shares were repurchased in fiscal  or since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new products and processes  and increase our participation in emerging markets 
income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november   and amounted to million  million  and million  respectively 
as a result of certain temporary differences  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for fiscal as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
primarily driven by our enhanced profitability  net cash provided by operating activities grew to million in fiscal during the year ended november   accounts receivable and inventory turnover rates decreased slightly 
net cash generated by operating activities was  in  down million from the preceding year 
with sales volume and production requirements significantly growing  accounts receivable and inventories increased in by million and million  respectively 
operating cash flow in also reflects the payment of a ten year insurance premium in the amount of million 
the related insurance policy provides environmental clean up cost cap coverage and pollution legal liability coverage for our recently acquired state college facility 
net cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal accounts receivable turnover rates improved in  primarily reflecting the successful integration of collection efforts for our acquired businesses 
at november   goodwill represented of our total assets and of our stockholders equity 
in addition to a total of million of goodwill recognized in connection with our recent acquisitions of emf  atp  and jdk  another million of goodwill was realized in earlier acquisitions 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of september of each fiscal year and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november   and quantitati ve and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos and chinese yuan 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
environmental matters on december   we acquired certain land and ceramic manufacturing facilities in state college  pennsylvania 
the property  which was acquired from murata electronics north america murata  consists of approximately acres of land and  square feet of manufacturing facilities 
among other uses  the acquired facilities have become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic operations  replacing the ceramic operations previously conducted in new orleans  louisiana 
the purchase price for the acquired property consisted of a  plus b closing costs of  including realtor commissions  transfer taxes  and legal fees  plus c the assumption of  and indemnification of murata against  all environmental liabilities related to the property 
the acquired property has known environmental conditions that require remediation  and certain hazardous materials previously used on the property have migrated into neighboring third party areas 
these environmental issues arose from the use of chlorinated organic solvents including tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce 
as a condition to the purchase  we entered into an agreement with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep pursuant to which a we agreed to remediate all known environmental conditions relating to the property to a specified industrial standard  with our costs for remediating such conditions being capped at million  b padep released murata from further claims by pennsylvania under specified state laws for the known environmental conditions  and c we purchased an insurance policy providing clean up cost cap coverage for known and unknown pollutants with a combined coverage limit of approximately million  and pollution legal liability coverage for possible third party claims with an aggregate coverage limit of million 
the total premium cost for the insurance policy  which has a ten year term and an aggregate deductible of  was million 
the cost of the insurance associated with the environmental clean up million is being charged to general and administrative expense in direct proportion to the actual remediation costs incurred 
the cost of the insurance associated with the pollution legal liability coverage million is being charged to general and administrative expense on a pro rata basis over the ten year policy term 
based upon our environmental review of the property  we recorded a liability of million to cover probable future environmental expenditures related to the remediation  the cost of which is expected to be entirely covered by the insurance policy 
as of november   remediation expenditures of million have been incurred and charged against the environmental liability  with all such expenditures being reimbursed by the insurance carrier 
the remaining aggregate undiscounted expenditures of million  which are anticipated to be incurred over the next eight years  principally consist of a continued operation and monitoring of the existing on site groundwater extraction  treatment  and recharge system  b implementation of a chemical oxidation system  subject to the results of a laboratory treatability study  c completion of soil investigations to determine the extent of potential soil contamination  d excavation and off site disposal of soil containing contaminates above acceptable standards  and e implementation of soil vapor extraction systems in certain areas 
depending upon the results of future environmental testing and remediation actions  it is possible that the ultimate costs incurred could exceed the current aggregate estimate of million 
we expect such increase  if any  to be entirely covered by the insurance policy 
insurance recoveries for actual environmental remediation costs incurred are recorded when it is probable that such insurance reimbursement will be received and the related amounts are determinable 
such insurance recoveries are credited to the company s general and administrative expense 
based on the current remediation plan   of the total remediation costs are expected to be incurred during the next twelve months 
we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein

 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
 defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
prior to this statement  there were different definitions of fair value and limited guidance for applying those definitions in gaap 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of sfas no 
will change current practice 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years the company s fiscal year 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no

this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  the company s fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of fin  sfas no 
 or sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that market conditions in the communications equipment industry will improve during fiscal if this improvement does not occur  or if current market conditions deteriorate  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
we review goodwill for possible impairment at least annually 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses other than losses for certain tangible assets damaged or destroyed by hurricane katrina have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that market conditions throughout the communications equipment industry will improve and conditions throughout the military defense sector will continue to be strong 
if long term market conditions do not improve  or in fact deteriorate  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed 
these adjustments  when made  may have a materially negative impact on our financial statements
