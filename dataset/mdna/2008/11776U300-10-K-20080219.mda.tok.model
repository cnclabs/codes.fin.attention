risk factors 
the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents microsoft related risk factors due to the market that we serve and  in particular  our focus on devices utilizing microsoft s windows embedded operating systems as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the resale of microsoft embedded operating systems  microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business 
the following represent several microsoft related risk factors which may negatively impact our business and operating results 
if we do not maintain our oem distribution agreement with microsoft  our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected 
we have an oem distribution agreement oda with microsoft  which enables us to resell microsoft windows embedded operating systems to our customers in the united states  canada  the caribbean excluding cuba and mexico 
software sales under this agreement constitute a significant portion of our revenue 
if the oda was terminated  our software revenue and resulting gross profit would decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted 
the oda is renewable annually  and there is no automatic renewal provision in the agreement 
the oda was renewed in june and will expire on june   unless terminated earlier under the provisions of the oda 
there were no material changes to the provisions of the oda as a result of the renewal in june future renewals  if any  could be on less favorable terms  which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
microsoft has audited our records under our oem distribution agreement in the past and will likely do so again in the future  and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and or the termination of the oda 
there are provisions in the oda that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for royalty auditing and other reasons 
non compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the oda 
during  microsoft conducted an audit of our records pertaining to the oda  which covered the period from december of through september there were no material findings 
a similar audit conducted in and  covering a period of five years  resulted in a payment to microsoft of  it is possible that future audits could result in additional charges 
if we do not maintain our favorable relationship with microsoft  we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms 
as a result  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
we maintain a strategic marketing relationship with microsoft 
in the event that our relationship with microsoft were to deteriorate  our efforts to market and sell our software and services to oems and others could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 
microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of oems and others utilizing windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms for smart devices and these targeted platforms are a significant focus for us 
microsoft provides customers referrals to us 
moreover  microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems 
microsoft s marketing activities  including trade shows  direct mail campaigns and print advertising  are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms and  consequently  to our sale of windows based embedded software and services 
we must maintain a favorable relationship with microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them  which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows  listing our services on microsoft s website  and receiving customer referrals 
in the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with microsoft  or fail to receive referrals from them  we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market software products and services directly to potential customers 
in addition  we depend on microsoft for developer releases of new versions of  and upgrades to  windows embedded and windows mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services 
if we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with microsoft  our revenue could decline and or our costs could increase thereby negatively impacting our operating results 

table of contents unexpected delays or announcement of delays by microsoft of windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms product releases could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
unexpected delays or announcement of delays in microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of its windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and or to complete customer projects on a timely basis 
these delays  or announcements of delays by microsoft  could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions  which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 
if microsoft adds features to its windows operating system or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide  our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted 
as the developer of windows  windows xp embedded  windows ce and windows mobile  microsoft could add features to its operating systems or could develop products that directly compete with the products and services we provide to our customers 
the ability of our customers  or potential customers  to obtain products and services directly from microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively affect our revenue and operating results 
even if the standard features of future microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings  a significant number of our customers  and potential customers  might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of microsoft s competing offerings 
moreover  the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our products and reduce our revenue and gross profit margin accordingly and our operating results could be adversely impacted 
microsoft has released windows ce version and version of its windows mobile smartphone and pocketpc operating systems which contain basic sdio functionality and is therefore competitive with our sdio hx now and sdio hx product offerings 
an agreement with microsoft required us to deliver to microsoft our sdio now v source code for inclusion into windows ce and windows mobile since that source code was delivered to microsoft  we have continued to develop our sdio now product line  introducing sdio now v  v and most recently sdio now hx  with new features and performance improvements that we believe are important to customers 
additionally  we plan further enhancements to our sdio now software product in and beyond 
however  there can be no assurance that our next generation sdio now product offerings will continue to be competitive in the marketplace or that customers will not decide to use the basic functionality they receive from microsoft as part of the operating system 
if the market for windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms fails to develop further  develops more slowly than expected  or declines  our business and operating results may be materially harmed 
because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at the windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile platforms  if the market for these systems or platforms fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  or declines  our business and operating results could be negatively impacted 
market acceptance of windows embedded and windows mobile will depend on many factors  including microsoft s development and support of the windows embedded and windows mobile markets 
as the developer and primary promoter of windows ce  windows xp embedded and windows mobile  if microsoft were to decide to discontinue or lessen its support of these operating systems and platforms  potential customers could select competing operating systems  which could reduce the demand for our windows embedded and windows mobile software products and engineering services which is our primary focus today  the ability of the microsoft windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile software to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart device market  including vxworks and linux from windriver systems inc  symbian and palm os from palmsource  inc  javaos from 
table of contents sun microsystems  inc  android from google inc  and other proprietary operating systems 
in particular  in the market for handheld devices  windows mobile faces intense competition from the linux operating system 
in the market for converged devices  windows embedded faces intense competition from the symbian operating system 
windows embedded operating systems and the windows mobile targeted platforms may be unsuccessful in capturing a significant share of these two segments of the smart device market  or in maintaining its market share therein  the acceptance by oems and consumers of the mix of features and functions offered by windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms  and the willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms 
to the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to smart device users than those available on windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms  potential purchasers could select competing operating systems over windows embedded operating systems and windows mobile targeted platforms 
general business related risk factors our marketplace is extremely competitive  which may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share 
the market for windows based embedded software and services is extremely competitive 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margin and loss of customers and market share  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we face competition from our current and potential customers internal research and development departments  which may seek to develop their own proprietary products and solutions that compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services  engineering service firms  including off shore development companies  such as intrinsyc  vanteon  teleca and wipro  odms  particularly those in taiwan  which have or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings  contract manufacturers  which are adding software development capabilities to their offerings  and microsoft embedded operating system distributors such as arrow and avnet 
larger customers of microsoft embedded operating systems are typically knowledgeable of the competing distributors in the north american market and  consequently  will often put large orders out to bid amongst the distributors  which can create margin pressure and make it difficult to maintain long term relationships with these customers 
the gross profit margin on sales of microsoft embedded windows licenses is relatively low  historically about on average 
there can be no assurance that gross profit on future sales will not decline given these competitive pressures 
as we develop new software products and service offerings  particularly offerings focused on specific industries  we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed 
it is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances  including alliances with microsoft  that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share 
microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us  nor has it agreed not to compete with us 
microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in house  possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us 
the barrier to entering the market as a provider of windows based smart device software and services is low 
in addition  microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on windows embedded operating system software and services 
these systems integrators are given substantially the same access by microsoft to the windows technology as we are 
new competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the windows based smart device market  and as new products and technologies are introduced 

table of contents our ability to maintain or grow the portion of our software revenue attributable to our own proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive  unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs 
if we are not successful in doing so  our business would be harmed 
proprietary software product sales provide us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third party software products and our engineering service offerings as well as provide other advantages 
increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth strategy 
our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise  develop and introduce new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and expand the number of proprietary products that we sell  and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results 
we may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services  and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
the market for windows based smart device software and services is very competitive 
as a result  the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate 
to be successful  we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software product and service offerings with attractive features  prices and terms that appeal to our customers 
we have experienced delays in new product and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future 
our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products  product enhancements and or new services offerings  or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully 
in addition  our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and or services if we  microsoft  our competitors or major hardware  systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products 
our success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology 
even if a customer selects our products to incorporate into its device  the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully 
a cancellation or change in plans by a customer  whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise  could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated 
also  our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology 
if the market for smart devices develops more slowly than we expect  or declines  our revenue may not develop as anticipated  if at all  and our business would be harmed 
the market for smart devices is still emerging and the potential size of this market and the timing of its development are not known 
as a result  our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated 
we are dependent upon the broad acceptance by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of smart devices  which will depend on many factors  including the development of content and applications for smart devices  the willingness of large numbers of businesses and consumers to use devices such as smartphones  pdas and handheld industrial data collectors to perform functions historically carried out manually  or by traditional pcs  including inputting and sharing data  communicating among users and connecting to the internet  and the evolution of industry standards or the necessary infrastructure that facilitate the distribution of content over the internet to these devices via wired and wireless telecommunications systems  satellite or cable 

table of contents the success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace  which is  in turn  contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors  including those using lower cost offshore resources 
if we are unable to do so successfully  our business could be harmed 
we are a leader in providing engineering services to smart device customers 
our market differentiation is created through several factors  including our experience with a variety of smart device platforms and applications 
our differentiation is contingent  in part  on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise  significantly all of whom are currently based in the united states 
to the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using lower cost offshore resources  our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted 
the success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably 
if we are unable to do so  our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted 
various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts  including specification changes  customer deliverable delays  inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery 
if we are unable to adequately scope  bid and deliver on service engagements successfully  our service revenue  service gross profit and operating results could be negatively impacted 
in addition  depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project  we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue  service gross profit and operating results 
we have entered into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work at relatively low rates per hour in exchange for future royalties 
there is no guarantee that these arrangements will culminate as anticipated 
we have entered into service contracts that involve reducing up front engineering service rate and fees in return for a per device royalty earned as our customers ship their devices  and we may enter into more such agreements in the future 
some of these contracts call for guaranteed royalty payments by our customers 
because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed  there is a risk that our customers may cancel their device projects or that their devices may not be successful in the market 
cooperation and support from svs is critical for the success of our hardware reference designs 
such cooperation cannot be assured 
we have been developing hardware reference designs based on the marvell pxa xscale architecture and plan to develop reference designs based on other silicon architectures 
it is important that the silicon on which we base our reference designs receive continued support in the marketplace by the silicon vendors 
for example  during the development of our designs  intel made a strategic decision to sell its pxa xscale division to marvell which negatively impacted the sale of our xscale based reference designs 
there can be no assurance that marvell will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting with our reference designs 
cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical to the success of our reference designs  and should silicon vendors not support our efforts  our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted 
the long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and engineering service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the timing of budget cycles  and 
table of contents the timing of customers competitive evaluation processes 
in addition  to successfully sell software and engineering service offerings  we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of these software and services  which can require significant time 
if our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly  it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue  which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected should the financial condition of our customers erode  given that such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services  could cause them to terminate their relationships with us  and or could increase the risk that customers default on their payment obligations 
if the global information technology market weakens  the likelihood of the erosion of the financial condition of our customers increases  which could adversely affect the demand for our software and services 
additionally  while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  this allowances may not cover actual losses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs 
our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future 
in addition  to the extent we develop and sell increasingly comprehensive  customized turnkey solutions for our customers  we may be increasingly subject to risks of product liability claims 
there is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside  the scope of our insurance coverage  and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
a product liability claim brought against us  whether successful or not  could harm our business and operating results 
past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate  and future acquisitions  if any  could disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we have acquired the technologies  assets and or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies  products  services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy 
as an example  on december   we acquired certain assets of nec corporation of america for  in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities and obligations 
if we fail to properly evaluate  integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
to successfully complete an acquisition  we must properly evaluate the technology  accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses  integrate and retain personnel  combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development  sales  marketing and support operations 
if we fail to do any of these  we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees  customers and strategic partners 
additionally  management may be distracted from day to day operations 
we also may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  which are especially critical in light of the sarbanes oxley and other corporate governance requirements  and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations  information services and financial  legal and marketing resources 
finally  acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies  which could be significant 
intellectual property related risk factors our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages 
it is difficult to determine whether our products and engineering services infringe third party intellectual property rights  particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap 
table of contents and where there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed 
if we were to discover that one of our products or service offerings  or a product based on one of our reference designs  violated a third party s proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  to continue offering that product or service 
similarly  third parties may claim that our current or future products and services infringe their proprietary rights  regardless of whether such claims have merit 
any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results 
in certain cases  we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third party technology incorporated into our products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others 
however  any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount 
even if we receive broad third party indemnification  these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement 
in addition  in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our products or services 
there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims related to the products and services we provide  or arising from the incorporation by us of third party technology  and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims  will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
some of our competitors have  or are affiliated  with companies with substantially greater resources than we have  and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could 
in addition  we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows  and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays 
furthermore  if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us  we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products  or delivering services based on the infringing technology  unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if such license is not obtained  we would be required to cease these related business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenue and operating results 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue adversely affected 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our intellectual property 
these laws and procedures provide only limited protection 
it is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some  or all  of our products and services 
if that occurred  we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents 
the patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all or on acceptable terms 
similarly  it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent 
in general  there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us 
we frequently license the source code of our products and the source code results of our services to customers 
there can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or  in the event of discovery of violations  that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and or recover the economic value lost from such violations 
to license some of our software products  we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
as with other software  our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected  and policing such unauthorized use is difficult 
a significant portion of our marks include the word bsquare or the preface b 
other companies use forms of bsquare or the preface b in their marks alone  or in combination with other words  and we cannot prevent all such third party uses 
we license certain trademark rights to third parties 
such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights and may take actions that would harm our business 

table of contents the computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation  which is often complex and expensive  and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results 
our software or hardware products or the third party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services 
software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart devices frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and  in some cases  have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products 
some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work 
to the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase 
in addition  it is possible that by the time defects are fixed  the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue 
moreover  to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services  particularly those focused on hardware  and rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products  we will be dependent on the ability of third party manufacturers to correct  identify and prevent manufacturing errors 
errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs  all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results 
if we are unable to license key software from third parties  our business could be harmed 
we sometimes integrate third party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third party software offerings on a standalone basis eg embedded operating systems under our oda with microsoft 
if our relationships with these third party software vendors were to deteriorate  or be eliminated in their entirety  we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain these third party software offerings  we would be required to develop this technology internally  assuming it was economically or technically feasible  or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace  which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products  or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services  thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results 
governance and contract related risk factors it might be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and washington law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our board of directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 
as a result  preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
the directors in each class serve for three year terms  one class being elected each year by our shareholders 
this system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors 
in addition  chapter of the washington business corporation act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition  unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s board of directors prior to the time of acquisition 
this provision may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of our company 
the 
table of contents existence of these anti takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of the act introduced new requirements regarding corporate governance and financial reporting 
among the many requirements of the act is for management to annually assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under section a and for our registered public accountant to attest to this report under section b 
the sec has modified the effective date and adoption requirements of section a and section b implementation for non accelerated filers multiple times  such that we are first required to issue our management report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december  we are currently required to have our auditor attest to management s assessment for our fiscal year ending december  however  on january   the sec proposed a one year extension to the auditor attestation requirement under section b which  if adopted  would require us to first comply with this requirement for our fiscal year ending december  we dedicated significant time and resources during fiscal to achieve compliance with section a 
during  we incurred  in external costs to comply with the requirements of section a 
the costs to comply with these requirements will continue to be significant and adversely affect our operating results 
non compliance with our lease agreement could have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
if we default under our corporate headquarters lease  the landlord has the ability to demand cash payments forgiven in under the former headquarters lease 
the amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment  in the event of default  decreases on a straight line basis over the length of our ten year headquarters lease 
the total amount of cash payments forgiven for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment was million at december  any breach of or non compliance with these lease agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business 
decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  and required changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of equity related compensation as key components of our overall employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our shareholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining shareholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options or new forms of equity instruments to employees in the future 
as a result  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  any of which could materially adversely affect our business 
international operations related risk factors our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property  management  collections  regulatory and other risks 
customers outside of north america generated approximately of our total revenue in and approximately in we currently have operations outside of north america in taipei  taiwan and tokyo  japan 
our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks  including the following greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property due to less stringent foreign intellectual property laws and enforcement policies  longer collection cycles than we typically experience in the north america  unfavorable changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  
table of contents complex and or adverse tax laws and or changes thereto 
additionally  we may be subject to income  withholding and other taxes for which we may realize no current benefit despite the existence of significant net operating losses and tax credits in the us  loss or reduction of withholding tax exemptions  the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  and general economic and political conditions in international markets which may differ from those in the us these risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices  as well as on our future international revenue  which could harm our business and operating results 
as we increase the amount of software development conducted in non us locations  potential delays and quality issues may impact our ability to timely deliver our software and services  potentially impacting our revenue and profitability 
we conduct development activities in non us locations  primarily india through a partnership with a local company and taiwan  to take advantage of the high quality  low cost software development resources found in those countries 
additionally  we have plans to increase development activity in both our taiwan operation and other non us locations as engineering demands necessitate the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
to date  we have limited experience in managing large scale software development done in non us locations 
expanding our software development in these locations inherently increases the complexity of managing these programs and may result in delays in introducing new products to market  or delays in completing service projects for our customers  which in turn may adversely impact the revenue we recognize from related products and services and could also adversely impact the profitability of service engagements employing offshore resources 
as our customers seek more cost effective locations to develop and manufacture their smart devices  particularly overseas locations  our ability to continue to sell these customers our products and services could be limited  which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
due to competitive and other pressures  some of our customers have and others may seek to move the development and manufacturing of their smart devices to overseas locations which may limit our ability to sell these customers our products and services 
as an example  under our oda with microsoft  we are only able to resell microsoft embedded operating systems primarily in north america 
if our customers  or potential customers  move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling these customers microsoft embedded operating systems  or our other products and services  which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results

item legal proceedings 
ipo litigation in summer and early fall  four purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the company  certain of the company s current and former officers and directors the individual defendants  and the underwriters of the company s initial public offering the underwriter defendants 
the complaints were consolidated into a single action and a consolidated amended complaint  which was filed on april   is now the operative complaint 
the suit purports to be a 
table of contents class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the company s common stock during the period from october  to december  the plaintiffs allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in the company s initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of stock in the aftermarket at pre determined prices 
the plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for the company s initial public offering was false and misleading in violation of the securities laws because the company did not disclose these arrangements 
the action seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
the action is being coordinated with approximately other nearly identical actions filed against other companies 
on october   the district court dismissed the individual defendants from the case without prejudice based upon stipulations of dismissal filed by the plaintiffs and the individual defendants 
on february   the district court denied the company s motion to dismiss the complaint 
on december   the second circuit vacated a decision by the district court granting class certification in six of the coordinated cases  which are intended to serve as test  or focus cases 
the plaintiffs selected these six cases  which do not include the company 
on april   the second circuit denied a petition for rehearing filed by the plaintiffs  but noted that the plaintiffs could ask the district court to certify more narrow classes than those that were rejected 
prior to the second circuit s ruling  the majority of the issuers  including the company  and their insurers had submitted a settlement agreement to the district court for approval 
in light of the second circuit opinion  the parties agreed that the settlement could not be approved 
on june   the district court approved a stipulation filed by the plaintiffs and the issuers which terminated the proposed settlement 
on august   the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases 
the amended complaints include a number of changes  such as changes to the definition of the purported class of investors  and the elimination of the individual defendants as defendants 
the six focus case issuers and the underwriters named as defendants in the focus cases filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints against them on november  on september   the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in the six focus cases 
on december   the issuers and the underwriters filed papers opposing the plaintiffs class certification motion  and the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the defendants motions to dismiss 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
the company cannot predict whether we will be able to renegotiate a settlement that complies with the second circuit s mandate  nor can the company predict the amount of any such settlement and whether that amount would be greater than the company s insurance coverage 
if the company is found liable  the company is unable to estimate or predict the potential damages that might be awarded  whether such damages would be greater than the company s insurance coverage  and whether such damages would have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition in any future period
