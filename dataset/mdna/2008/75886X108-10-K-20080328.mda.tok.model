for additional information regarding our efforts to commercialize tb  see proprietary rights below 
licensing efforts 
we also are continuing to focus on finding one or more third party pharmaceutical companies to license our technology and to help us continue the development of our product candidates 
we believe that having such partners would enable us to both defray the costs associated with the development of our product candidates and accelerate the speed with which we may be able to complete development of and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and commercialize such products 
however  we can offer no assurance that we will be able to enter into license and development agreements with third party pharmaceutical companies or that any such relationships would in fact decrease our costs or accelerate our product development efforts 
manufacturing we use an outside contract manufacturer to produce bulk tb  ie  the active pharmaceutical ingredient api via an established and proven manufacturing process known as solid phase peptide synthesis 
we are in the process of qualifying other manufacturers 
currently  we do not have any long term supply agreements in place 
therefore  we intend to establish a long term supply arrangement with at least one of these manufacturers in the near future  followed by a second manufacturer at the earliest practicable time 
no assurance can be given  however  that such agreements will be negotiated on favorable terms  or at all 
contractors are selected on the basis of their supply capability  ability to produce a drug substance in accordance with current good manufacturing practice gmp requirements of the fda  and ability to meet our established specifications 
we also use outside contract manufacturers to formulate bulk tb into a final drug product 
we have finished the formulation and development work for rgn used in our three phase ii chronic dermal wound trials currently underway 
we have completed formulation of a sterile eye drop  rgn  that we are using in our ophthalmic dv trial 
and  we have completed the formulation development of rgn  a sterile  parenteral injectable solution we will use in our phase i and ami trials 
all of these formulations may require additional studies and undergo various modifications as we move through our clinical development programs 
competition we are engaged in a business that is highly competitive 
research and development activities for the development of new drugs to treat patients with our targeted indications are being sponsored or conducted by private and public institutions and by major pharmaceutical companies located in the united states and a number of foreign countries 
most of these entities have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than ours  and specifically with regard to the conduct of clinical research and development activities  clinical testing and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products 
with respect to dermal wound healing  johnson johnson has marketed regranex for this purpose in patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
other companies  such as novartis  are developing and marketing artificial skins  which could compete with our product candidates in dermal wound healing areas 
moreover  dermal wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace attracting many companies  large and small  to develop therapeutic products and medical devices for treating acute and chronic dermal wounds including  for example  honey based ointments and low frequency cavitational ultrasound 
there are numerous companies and institutions engaged in research  development and marketing of products for ophthalmic wound healing and treatment of ophthalmic disorders where tb may be useful 
most specialty ophthalmic companies have various products on the market that could compete with tb or be modified to compete with our product candidates 
other companies market antibiotics and steroids to treat certain conditions within our area of focus 
currently  there are no approved pharmaceutical products for preventing or repairing cardiac damage resulting from an ami 
however  the market for a product of this type is significant and many pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are exploring products and technologies that may prevent such damage or improve cardiac function after an ami 
furthermore  if we were to successfully develop rgn for other cardiovascular indications  such as acute or chronic congestive heart failure  such a product would have to compete with other drugs currently marketed by large pharmaceutical companies for such indications 
government regulation in the united states  the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  the testing  manufacturing  labeling  storing  recordkeeping  approving  advertising  and promoting of our product candidates 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and foreign countries will be a significant factor in the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and product development activities 
any product candidate we develop will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous pre clinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures by the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries 
the process of obtaining these approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
pre clinical studies must ordinarily be conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy by pharmacology studies and the safety of an investigational new drug by toxicology studies 
the results of these studies  among other things are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must be reviewed and allowed to go into effect by the agency before clinical trials can begin 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a three stage process 
in phase i clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers to determine the safety profile  the pattern of drug distribution  metabolism and excretion  and to assess the drugs affect on the subject 
in phase ii therapeutic exploratory  trials are conducted with somewhat larger groups of patients  who are selected by a relatively narrow criteria yielding a relatively homogenous population that are afflicted with the target disease  in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
phase ii studies should allow for the determination of the dose to be used in phase iii 
in phase iii therapeutic confirmatory  large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy and safety required by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
the primary objective of phase iii clinical trials is to show that the drug confers therapeutic benefit 
the results of all of these pre clinical studies and clinical trials  along with detailed information on manufacturing  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application  or nda  for approval to commence commercial sales 
in responding to an nda  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if the fda determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
therefore  even if we complete phase iii clinical trials for certain of our product candidates  and submit an nda to the fda  there can be no assurance that the fda will grant marketing approvals  or if granted  that they will be granted on a timely basis 
if the fda does approve a product candidate  it may require  among other things  post marketing testing  including potentially expensive phase iv studies efficacy studies in the patient population after marketing  and surveillance to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the drug 
in addition  the fda may in some circumstances impose restrictions on the use of the drug that may be difficult and expensive to administer 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
among the conditions for an nda approval  is the requirement that the applicable manufacturing  clinical  pharmacovigilance  quality control and manufacturing procedures conform on an ongoing basis with current good clinical practices  good laboratory practices  current good manufacturing practices  and computer information system validation standards 
before approval of an nda  the fda will perform a prelicensing inspection of clinical sites  manufacturing facilities and the related quality control records to determine its compliance with these requirements 
to assure compliance  applicants must continue to expend time  money and effort in the area of training  production and quality control 
after the applicant is licensed for the manufacture of any product  manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the fda 
if a company fails to comply with fda regulatory requirements  fda may pursue a wide range of remedial actions 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress related to the regulation of drug products  and we cannot predict the outcome or effect of such legislation on our business 
in june  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for tb for the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa  a rare genetic disease characterized by the presence of extremely fragile skin and other tissues  resulting in recurrent blisters from minor mechanical friction or trauma 
under the act  the fda may designate a product or products as having orphan drug status to treat a rare disease or condition which is a disease or condition that affects populations of less than  individuals in the united states  or  if victims of a disease number more than  the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs 
if a product candidate is designated as an orphan drug  then the sponsor is entitled to receive certain incentives to undertake the development and marketing of the product  including grants for clinical trials 
in  we received a two year grant for  from the fda s office of orphan products 
another such incentive  once approved  is marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years 
there may be multiple designations of orphan drug status for a given drug and for different indications 
the sponsor of the first approved nda for a given drug for its use in treating a rare disease may receive marketing exclusivity for that specific use 
orphan drug designation does not guarantee that a product candidate will be approved by the fda for marketing for the designation  and even if a sponsor of a product candidate for an indication for use with an orphan drug designation is the first to obtain fda approval of an nda for that designation and obtains marketing exclusivity  another sponsor s application for the same drug product may be approved by the fda during the period of exclusivity if the fda concludes that it is clinically superior 
in this instance  the orphan designation and marketing exclusivity originally granted would be lost in favor of the clinically superior product 
proprietary rights we entered into a material transfer cooperative research and development agreement with the nih during the second quarter of under this agreement  we received an option to elect an exclusive or non exclusive commercialization license from the nih for any patent rights that might result from the nih research study that relate to the use of tb as a tissue growth and repair factor 
a provisional patent application was filed by nih in july  with a patent cooperation treaty application filed in july  pertaining to the work performed on tb on february   we executed an agreement with the nih giving us an exclusive worldwide license from the nih for all claims to tb within the patent application 
in exchange for the exclusive license  we must make certain royalty and milestone payments to the nih 
through december  we have complied with these requirements 
no assurance can be given as to whether or when certain patents will be issued  or as to any claims that may be included or excluded within the patent  or subsequent to its issuance we have also filed numerous additional patent applications covering various compositions  uses  formulations and other components of tb  as well as to novel peptides resulting from our research efforts 
during  we were issued a patent in europe and the us related to the original nih patent that expires twenty years from the filing date july  corresponding patents have been granted in hong kong  australia and china 
the issued european patent is being opposed by a third party at the european patent office 
in addition  we hold a us patent relating to the treatment of an autoimmune skin disease that results in hair loss  alopecia 
the patent  no 
 entitled hair regeneration compositions for treatment of alopecia and method of application related thereto  issued february  and expires in december of  with corresponding patents granted in europe and singapore which expire december  in february  we were issued a patent in china entitled treating epidermolysis bullosa with thymosin b  which expires may  there can be no assurance that these  or any other future patent applications under which we have rights  will result in the issuance of a patent or that any patent issued will not be subject to challenge or opposition 
in the case of a claim of patent infringement by or against us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation that may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights 
under a research agreement with the george washington university gwu  we funded tb research at gwu and were granted a sole and exclusive world wide license to any patents that resulted from such research 
while we no longer fund research under this agreement  we remain obligated to pay gwu a royalty of of the net sales  if any  of specified products covered by patents issued in connection with the agreement 
pursuant to the research agreement  we have exclusive rights to patent applications filed in the united states and in europe disclosing the use of tb for the treatment of septic shock and associated syndromes  including adult respiratory distress syndrome 
two us patents have been issued 
the first patent  no 
 entitled method of treating septic shock using tb  issued on november  and expires in november and the second patent  no 
 entitled method of treating septic shock by preventing actin polymerization  issued on january  and expires in october no sales have occurred and as a result  no royalty payments have yet been incurred or paid to gwu pursuant to the research agreement 
we have also filed other patent applications related to tb and related compounds and indications for their use in countries throughout the world 
material agreements licensing agreements 
as noted in proprietary rights above  we are obligated to pay royalties to the nih and gwu 
while the nih agreement calls for a minimum annual royalty of  other obligations will be triggered only upon the sale or license of our technology to a third party 
defiante farmaceutica  lda 
we have exclusively licensed certain internal and external wound healing european rights to tb to defiante farmaceutica  lda  or defiante  a portuguese company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of sigma tau  a pharmaceutical company headquartered in rome  italy and our largest stockholder 
these rights include indications relative to all of our current dermal clinical trials and amis  but exclude ophthalmic indications and other indications that are disease based and not the result of a wound 
defiante will develop tb for internal and external wounds in europe and certain other contiguous and geographically relevant countries 
the agreement expires on a country by country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire of any granted patent in the territory having at least one valid claim covering the products then on the market  the expiration of any other exclusive or proprietary marketing rights or twelve years from the effective date of the agreement which was in january 
under the agreement  defiante will pay us a royalty on commercial sales and we will supply all required tb when at least one positive phase ii clinical trial is completed  defiante must either pay us million or initiate a pivotal phase iii clinical trial to maintain the license 
defiante also will be obligated to attain future clinical and regulatory milestones in the licensed territory 
as those milestones are attained  certain performance criteria regarding commercial registration and minimum annual royalties will be required in each licensed country 
the agreement does not prevent us from sublicensing the technology in countries outside the licensed territory  and has no impact on any us rights 
clinical development agreements we entered into various agreements with a variety of outside service providers for the manufacture and development of tb  formulation of product candidates  the conduct of pre clinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies in animal models  and management execution of clinical trials in humans 
terms of these agreements vary  in that they can last from a few months to more than a year in duration 
certain of these agreements require initial up front payments ranging from to of the total estimated cost 
for additional information regarding the costs incurred for our clinical development over the past two years  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
employees to balance costs and optimize control  we utilize an outsourcing business strategy  whereby our internal  experienced management experts  tightly control outsourced activities for many of our research and development and administrative functions 
recognizing the periodic spikes in costs associated with a focused clinical development effort  complicated further by the constant variation in skills needed at any one time  ranging from chemical drug formulation to pre clinical studies to clinical trial management  we believe that the use of outside contractors as and when needed is more cost effective than directly employing and maintaining facilities to support these varied efforts 
we currently have ten full time employees

risk factors  risks related to our business we have incurred losses since inception and expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
we have sustained operating losses since our inception in we believe these losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we pursue our product development efforts related to t as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
we anticipate substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts and seek to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates to make them commercially viable 
our ability to generate additional revenues and potential to become profitable will depend largely on our ability  alone or through the efforts of third party licensees  to efficiently and successfully complete the development of our product candidates  obtain necessary regulatory approvals for commercialization  scale up commercial quantity manufacturing capabilities either internally or through third party suppliers  and market our product candidates 
there can be no assurance that these objectives will occur or that we will ever become profitable or be able to maintain profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot predict the level of such profitability 
if we sustain losses over an extended period of time and are not otherwise able to raise necessary funds to continue our development efforts and maintain our operations  we may be forced to cease operations 
we will need substantial additional capital to develop our product candidates and for our future operations 
if we are unable to obtain such funds when needed  we may have to delay  scale back or terminate our product development efforts or our business 
we anticipate that substantial new capital resources will be required to continue our independent development efforts  including any and all follow on trials that will result from our current clinical programs  and increasingly scaled up manufacturing processes for rgn  rgn and rgn the actual amount of funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  without limitation  the scope of our clinical trials  which is significantly influenced by the quality of clinical data achieved as trials complete and the requirements established by regulatory authorities  the speed with which we complete our clinical trials complete  which depends on the speed with which we can attract and enroll qualifying patients and the quality of the work performed by our clinical investigators  the time required to prosecute  enforce and defend our intellectual property rights  which depends on evolving patent legal regimes and claims infringement assertions that may arise between us and third parties  the ability to manufacture at scales sufficient to supply commercial quantities  which may require levels of effort not currently anticipated and the successful commercialization of our drug candidates  which will depend on our ability to either create or partner with an effective commercialization organization and which could be delayed or prevented by the emergence of equal or more effective therapies 
potential sources of outside capital include entering into strategic business relationships  public or private sales of shares of our capital stock  or debt  or other similar financial instruments 
while we recently closed a private placement of million in common stock and warrants to purchase common stock involving certain of our existing investors  we do not have any other committed sources of outside capital at this time 
consequently  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital in sufficient amounts  or on acceptable terms  or at times critical to the uninterrupted execution of our business strategy 
one potential source of capital often capitalized on by emerging biotechnology companies similar to regenerx is through licensing certain intellectual property rights to other biotechnology or pharmaceutical enterprises  ie a strategic partner 
if we raise additional capital through such a strategic business relationship  we may have to give up valuable short and or long term rights to intellectual property 
in addition and as the business priorities of the strategic partner change over time  the possibility exists that the interests of the strategic partner may shift causing a material negative impact on the value of our interest in the licensed products 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be significantly diluted 
in addition  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities  these securities are likely to have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock and may involve significant fees  interest expense  restrictive covenants and the granting of security interests in our assets 
our failure to successfully address ongoing liquidity requirements would have a material negative impact on our business  including the possibly of surrendering our rights to some technologies or product opportunities  delaying our clinical trials  or ceasing operations 
our business prospects are difficult to evaluate because we are developing complex and novel medical product candidates 
since our product candidates rely on complex technologies  it may be difficult for you to assess our growth  partnering and earnings potential 
it is likely we will face many of the difficulties that new technology companies often face 
these include  among others limited financial resources  developing novel  commercial grade drug substances  testing and evaluating a new chemical entity and its effects in highly complex biological systems  marketing new products for which a market is not yet established and may never become established  challenges related to the approval and acceptance of drug candidates by federal and international regulatory authorities  delays inherent in and increasingly more common in the execution of clinical trials  high product development costs that result from all of these factors  competition from other therapies and drug candidates promoted by entities with significantly more capital resources and marketing expertise and difficulty recruiting qualified employees for management and other positions 
we will likely face these and other difficulties in the future  some of which may be beyond our control 
if we are unable to successfully address these difficulties as they arise  our future growth and earnings will be negatively affected 
we cannot be certain that our product candidates will prove safe and efficacious  that our business strategies will be successful or that we will successfully address any and all problems that may arise 
we may not successfully establish and maintain development and testing relationships with third parties  which could adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates 
we have only limited resources  experience with and capacity to conduct requisite testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates 
as a result  we rely and expect to continue to rely on third party service providers and collaborators  including corporate partners  licensors and contract research organizations cros  to perform a number of activities relating to the development of our drug candidates  including the design and conduct of clinical trials  and potentially the obtaining of regulatory approvals 
for example  we currently rely on several third party contractors to manufacture t  formulate rgn  rgn and rgn into the drug candidates rgn  rgn and rgn  develop requisite assays to assess t s affect in complex biological systems  recruit investigators and sites to participate in our trials  manage the clinical trial process  and collect  evaluate and report clinical results 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our current arrangements with third parties or maintain such relationships on favorable terms 
our agreements with these third parties may also contain provisions that restrict our ability to develop and test our product candidates or that give third parties rights to control aspects of our product development and clinical programs 
in addition  conflicts may arise with our collaborators  such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data  the achievement of milestones  the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration 
if any conflicts arise with our existing or future collaborators  they may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our best interests 
any failure to maintain our collaborative agreements and any conflicts with our collaborators could delay or prevent us from developing our product candidates 
we and our collaborators may fail to develop products covered by our present and future collaborations if  among other things we do not achieve our objectives under our collaboration agreements  we or our collaborators are unable to obtain patent protection for the products or proprietary technologies we develop in our collaborations  we are unable to manage multiple simultaneous product discovery and development collaborations  our collaborators become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors  we or our collaborators encounter regulatory hurdles that prevent commercialization of our product candidates  or we develop products and processes or enter into additional collaborations that conflict with the business objectives of our other collaborators 
we also have less control over the timing and other aspects of our clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own 
third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol or applicable regulations 
we also rely on clinical research organizations to perform much of our data management and analysis 
they may not provide these services as required or in a timely manner 
if any of these parties do not meet deadlines or follow proper procedures  including procedures required by law  the pre clinical studies and clinical trials may take longer than expected  may be delayed or may be terminated  which would have a materially negative impact on our product development efforts 
if we were forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of our pre clinical studies or clinical trials  we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms or at all 
even if we were able to find a replacement  resulting delays in the tests or trials may result in significant additional expenditures and delays in obtaining regulatory approval for drug candidates  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business prospects 
we are subject to intense government regulation and we may not receive regulatory approvals for our new drug candidates 
our product candidates will require regulatory approvals prior to sale 
in particular  therapeutic agents are subject to stringent approval  prior to commercial marketing  by the fda and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries 
the process of obtaining fda and corresponding foreign approvals is costly and time consuming and we cannot assure you that such approvals will be granted 
also  the regulations we are subject to change frequently  and such changes could cause delays in the development of our product candidates 
in addition  the timing of clinical trials is dependent on  among other things  fda and investigational review board irb reviews  clinical site approvals  successful manufacturing of clinical materials  sufficient funding and other factors outside of our control 
there can be no assurance that our clinical trials will in fact demonstrate  to the satisfaction of the fda and others  that our product candidates are sufficiently safe or effective 
the fda or we may also restrict or suspend our clinical trials at any time if either believes that we are exposing the subjects participating in the trials to unacceptable health risks 
as a consequence  we may need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned  for reasons such as the following the fda or other health regulatory authorities  or institutional review boards  do not approve a clinical trial protocol or place a clinical trial on hold  suitable patients do not enroll in a clinical trial in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate  or data is adversely affected by trial conduct or patient drop out  patients experience serious adverse events  including adverse side effects of our drug candidates  patients die during a clinical trial for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates  including the advanced stage of their disease and medical problems  patients in the placebo or untreated control group exhibit greater than expected improvements or fewer than expected adverse events  third party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices  or other third party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  service providers  collaborators or co sponsors do not adequately perform their obligations in relation to the clinical trial or cause the trial to be delayed or terminated  regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities  which may  among other things  require us or a co sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical trials  the interim results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or negative  the clinical trial  although approved and completed  generates data that is not considered by the fda or others to be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy  and changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions affect the conduct of the clinical trial or the interpretation of its results 
any failure to obtain or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we may not be able to enter into strategic relationships with third parties related to the development and commercialization of our product candidates one of our strategic focuses is to enter into relationships with one or more third party pharmaceutical companies to license our technology and to help us continue the development of our product candidates 
we believe that having such partners would enable us to both defray the costs associated with the development of our product candidates and accelerate the speed with which we may be able to complete development of and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and commercialize such products 
however  we can offer no assurance that we will be able to enter into license and development agreements with third party pharmaceutical companies or that any such relationships would in fact decrease our costs or accelerate our product development efforts 
if we are unable to enter into such relationships  our product development efforts may be slowed or related costs may increase 
in addition  any such relationships would require us to give up significant rights in our product candidates  which rights may  over time  have been worth more to us if we had been able to commercialize such product candidates without entering into third party agreements 
mauro bove  a member of our board  is also a director and officer of sigma tau  our largest stockholder  which could give rise to a conflict of interest involving mr 
bove 
mauro bove  a member of our board  is also a director and officer of sigma tau  our largest stockholder and our partner in europe with respect to the development of certain of our drug candidates 
we recently issued shares of common stock and common stock warrants to certain affiliates of sigma tau in a private placement that gave us the right to repurchase the shares under certain circumstances 
also  in  we licensed t to defiante farmaceutica spa  a wholly owned subsidiary of sigma tau  for internal and external wound healing for the european union 
upon the successful completion of a phase ii trial defiante is obligated to either make a million milestone payment or initiate and pay for a pivotal phase iii trial 
as a result of mr 
bove s relationship with sigma tau  there could be a conflict of interest between mr 
bove and our stockholders other than sigma tau with respect to these and other agreements and circumstances that may require the exercise of the board s discretion with respect to sigma tau 
we are heavily reliant on our license from the national institutes of health and may be unable to maintain our license 
we have received an exclusive world wide license to intellectual property discovered at the national institutes of health  or nih  pertaining to wound healing and tissue repair 
this license terminates upon the last to expire of the patent applications that are filed in connection with the license 
this license requires us to pay a minimum annual royalty to the nih  regardless of the success of our product development efforts  plus certain other royalties upon the sale of products created by the intellectual property granted under the license 
we rely on this license for a significant portion of our business 
this license may be terminated for a number of reasons  including non payment of the royalty or lack of continued product development  among others 
the loss of this license would have a material adverse effect on our business and business prospects and may require us to cease development of our current line of product candidates 
all of our drug candidates are based on a single compound that has yet to be proven effective 
our current primary business focus is the development of t  and its analogues  derivatives and fragments  for the treatment of non healing wounds and other conditions 
while we have in the past explored and may in the future explore the use of other compounds for the treatment of other medical conditions  we presently have no immediate plans to develop products for such purposes 
unlike many pharmaceutical companies that have a number of unique chemical entities in development  we are dependent on a single molecule  formulated for different administrations  for the success of our company 
as a result  any common safety or efficacy concerns for t based products that cross formulations  would have a much greater impact on our business prospects than if we were more diversified 
our new drug candidates are still in research and development  and we do not expect them to be commercially available for the foreseeable future  if at all 
only a small number of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
these reasons include the possibility that the potential products may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during pre clinical studies or clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical or otherwise fail to achieve market acceptance 
if any of these potential problems occurs  we may never successfully market t based products 
we have no manufacturing or formulation capabilities and are dependent upon third party suppliers to provide us with our product candidates 
if these suppliers do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities  at acceptable quality levels and at acceptable cost and if we are unable to identify suitable replacement suppliers  our clinical development efforts could be delayed  prevented or impaired 
we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and have little experience in manufacturing pharmaceutical products 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  primarily on one of the leading peptide manufacturers to supply us with t for further formulation into our product candidates 
we have engaged three separate smaller drug formulation contractors for the formulation of clinical grade product candidates  one each for rgn  rgn and rgn we currently do not have an alternative source of supply for either t or the individual drug candidates 
if these suppliers  together or individually  are not able to supply us with either t or individual product candidates on a timely basis  in sufficient quantities  at acceptable levels of quality and at a competitive price  and  if we are unable to identify a replacement manufacturer to perform these functions on acceptable terms  our development programs  collectively or individually  could be seriously jeopardized 
the risks of relying solely on single suppliers for our product candidates include their respective abilities to ensure quality and compliance with regulations relating to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals  their manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient or available to produce the required quantities of our product candidates based on our planned clinical development schedule  if at all  they may not have access to the capital necessary to expand their manufacturing facilities in response to our needs  commissioning replacement suppliers would be difficult and time consuming  individual suppliers may have used substantial proprietary know how relating to the manufacture of our product candidates and  in the event we must find a replacement or supplemental supplier  our ability to transfer this know how to the new supplier could be an expensive and or time consuming process  an individual supplier may experience events  such as a fire or natural disaster  that force it to stop or curtail production for an extended period  an individual supplier could encounter significant increases in labor  capital or other costs that would make it difficult for them to produce our products cost effectively  an individual supplier may not be able to obtain the raw materials or validated drug containers in sufficient quantities  at acceptable costs or in sufficient time to complete the manufacture  formulation and delivery of our product candidates 
if any of our key executives discontinue their services with us  our efforts to develop our business may be delayed 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management team and the loss of our chairman  allan goldstein  or chief executive officer  jj finkelstein  could prevent or significantly delay the achievement of our goals 
we have employment agreements with dr 
goldstein and mr 
finkelstein 
however  we cannot assure you that such agreements would prevent them from terminating their employment with or without good reason 
in addition  we do not maintain a key man life insurance policy with respect to dr 
goldstein or mr 
finkelstein 
in the future  we anticipate that we will need to add additional management and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense  and our success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to attract or retain such personnel will be successful 
we are subject to intense competition from companies with greater resources and more mature products 
we are engaged in a business that is highly competitive 
research and development activities for the development of drugs to treat indications within our focus are being sponsored or conducted by private and public institutions and by major pharmaceutical companies located in the united states and a number of foreign countries 
most of these companies and institutions have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than our own  and that have extensive experience in conducting research and development activities and clinical trials and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products 
with respect to wound healing  johnson johnson is marketing regranex for this purpose in patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
other companies  such as novartis  are developing and marketing artificial skins which could compete with our product candidates in certain wound healing areas 
moreover  wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace attracting many companies  large and small  to develop products for treating acute and chronic wounds  for example honey based ointments and low frequency cavitational ultrasound 
additionally  most large pharmaceutical companies and many smaller biomedical companies are vigorously pursuing therapeutics to treat patients after heart attacks and other cardiovascular indications 
we face the risk of product liability claims  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability claims as a result of our testing  manufacturing  and marketing of drugs 
in addition  the use of our product candidates  when and if developed and sold  will expose us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability may result from harm to patients using our product candidates  such as a complication that was either not communicated as a potential side effect or was more extreme than communicated 
we will require all patients enrolled in our clinical trials to sign consents  which explain various risks involved with participating in the trial 
however  patient consents provide only a limited level of protection  and it may be alleged that the consent did not address or did not adequately address a risk that the patient suffered 
additionally  we will generally be required to indemnify the clinical product manufacturers  clinical trial centers  medical professionals and other parties conducting related activities in connection with losses they may incur through their involvement in the clinical trials 
our ability to reduce our liability exposure for human clinical trials and commercial sales of t is dependent in part on our ability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance or to collaborate with corporate partners that have adequate insurance 
although we intend to obtain product liability insurance coverage  we cannot guarantee that product liability insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  or that its coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims against us 
a product liability claim  even one without merit or for which we have substantial coverage  could result in significant legal defense costs  thereby potentially exposing us to expenses significantly in excess of our revenues 
governmental and third party payers may subject any product candidates we develop to sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls that could limit our product revenues and delay profitability 
the successful commercialization of our product candidates will likely depend on our ability to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the product and treatment 
government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  are increasingly seeking to lower the prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states  the growth of healthcare organizations such as hmos  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could have a significant influence on the purchase of healthcare services and products  resulting in lower prices and reducing demand for our product candidates 
the cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could reduce our ability to sell our product candidates and may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we cannot assure that reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries will be available for any of our product candidates  that any reimbursement granted will be maintained  or that limits on reimbursement available from third party payors will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  our product candidates 
the lack or inadequacy of third party reimbursements for certain of our product candidates would decrease the potential profitability of our operations 
we cannot forecast what additional legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect the legislation or regulation would have on our business 
clinical trials could be delayed or fail to show efficacy  resulting in additional cost or failure to commercialize our technology platform 
all of our drug candidates are currently in the clinical stage and we cannot be certain that a collaborator or we will successfully complete the clinical trials necessary to receive regulatory product approvals 
this process is lengthy  unpredictable and expensive 
to obtain regulatory approvals  a collaborative partner or we must ultimately demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda and others that our product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for their proposed use 
many factors  known and unknown  can adversely impact clinical trials and the ability to evaluate a product candidate s safety and efficacy  including unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites  slower than projected enrollment  competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians  regulatory requirements  limits on manufacturing capacity and failure of a product candidate to meet required standards for administration to humans 
such factors may have a negative impact on our business by making it difficult to advance product candidates or by reducing or eliminating their potential or perceived value 
further  if we are forced to contribute greater financial and clinical resources to a study  valuable resources will be diverted from other areas of our business 
clinical trials for product candidates such as ours are often conducted with patients who have more advanced forms of a particular condition and or other unrelated conditions 
for example  in clinical trials for our lead product candidate rgn  we expect to study patients who are not only suffering from chronic epidermal wounds but are also older and much more likely to have other serious adverse conditions 
during the course of treatment  these patients could die or suffer other adverse events for reasons that may or may not be related to the drug candidate being tested 
furthermore  and as a consequence that all of our drug candidates are based on t cross over risk exists  that is a patient in one trial may be adversely impacted by one drug candidate and that adverse event may have implications to our other trials and other drug candidates 
however  even if unrelated to our product candidates  such events can nevertheless adversely impact our clinical trials 
as a result  our business and ability to ultimately develop and market the product candidates and obtain revenues would suffer 
our ability to complete clinical trials depends on many factors  including obtaining adequate clinical supplies and having a sufficient rate of patient recruitment 
for example  patient recruitment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the perceptions of investigators and patients regarding safety  and the availability of other treatment options 
even if patients are successfully recruited  we cannot be sure they will complete the treatment process 
delays in patient enrollment or treatment in clinical trials may result in increased costs  program delays  or failure  any of which can substantially affect our business or perceived value 
a number of factors  including unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites  slower than projected enrollment  competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians  regulatory requirements  limits on manufacturing capacity and failure of a product candidate to meet required standards for administration to humans may cause significant delays in the completion of our clinical trials 
in addition  it may take longer than we expect to achieve study endpoints and complete data analysis for a trial 
we may not complete our clinical trials when or as projected or commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our other product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully 
if we fail to complete or if we experience material delays in completing the phase ii trials as currently planned  or we otherwise fail to commence or complete  or experience delays in  any of our other present or planned clinical trials  including as a result of the actions of third parties upon which we rely for these functions  our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could materially suffer 
development costs will increase if we experience any future delays in our clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than we currently plan 
if the delays or costs are significant  our financial results and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be adversely affected 
we have no marketing experience  sales force or distribution capabilities 
if our product candidates are approved  and we are unable to recruit key personnel to perform these functions  we may not be able to commercialize them successfully 
although we do not currently have any marketable products  our ability to produce revenues ultimately depends on our ability to sell our product candidates if and when they are approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
we currently have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we do not have a marketing and sales staff or distribution capabilities 
developing a marketing and sales force is also time consuming and could delay the launch of new products or expansion of existing product sales 
in addition  we will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
if we fail to establish successful marketing and sales capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties  our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
even if approved for marketing  our technologies and product candidates are relatively novel and unproven and they may fail to gain market acceptance 
our drug candidates which are all based on the molecule t are new and rapidly evolving and have not been shown to be effective on a widespread basis 
our product candidates  and the technology underlying them  are new and unproven and there is no guarantee that health care providers or patients will be interested in our product candidates even if they are approved for use 
our success will depend in part on our ability to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefits  reliability  safety  and cost effectiveness of our product candidates and technology relative to other approaches  as well as on our ability to continue to develop our product candidates to respond to competitive and technological changes 
if the market does not accept our product candidates or product candidates  when and if we are able to commercialize them  then we may never become profitable 
factors that could delay or inhibit market acceptance of our product candidates may include the timing and receipt of marketing approvals  the safety and efficacy of the products  the emergence of equivalent or superior products  the cost effectiveness of the products  and effective marketing 
it is difficult to predict the future growth of our business  if any  and the size of the market for our product candidates because the market and technology are continually evolving 
there can be no assurance that our technologies and product candidates will prove superior to technologies and products that may currently be available or may become available in the future or that our technologies or research and development activities will result in any commercially profitable products 
our technologies and product candidates may have unacceptable side effects that could delay or prevent product approval 
possible side effects of therapeutic technologies may be serious and life threatening 
the occurrence of any unacceptable side effects with our product candidates  during or after pre clinical studies and clinical trials  or the perception or possibility that our product candidates cause or could cause such side effects  could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and negatively impact our business 
our suppliers use hazardous and biological materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly  and we are not insured against such claims 
our product candidates and processes involve the controlled storage  use and disposal by our suppliers of certain hazardous and biological materials and waste products 
we and our suppliers and other collaborators are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of materials and waste products 
even if we and these suppliers and collaborators comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and we do not carry insurance for this type of claim 
we may also incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
to the extent we enter markets outside the united states our business will be subject to political  economic  legal and social risks in those markets  which could adversely affect our business 
there are significant regulatory and legal barriers in markets outside the united states that we must overcome to the extent we enter or attempt to enter markets in countries other than the united states 
we currently intend to market any approved products in the united states  europe  japan  india and territories surrounding the pacific rim 
we will be subject to the burden of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  including multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting laws 
we also may experience difficulties adapting to new cultures  business customs and legal systems 
any sales and operations outside the united states would be subject to political  economic and social uncertainties including  among others changes and limits in import and export controls  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes in currency exchange rates  economic and political instability  changes in government regulations and laws  absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights  and currency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain product candidates or repatriate profits to the united states 
any changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect our business to the extent we enter markets outside the united states 
we may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates 
if our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is competitive with one or more of our product candidates and we cannot show that our product candidate is clinically superior  we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time 
regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs that target relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
in june  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for tb for the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa  or eb  a rare genetic disease characterized by the presence of extremely fragile skin and other tissues  resulting in recurrent blisters from minor mechanical friction or trauma  and we may pursue orphan drug designation for additional product candidates 
generally  if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity 
the exclusivity applies only to the indication for which the drug has been designated and approved 
the applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the united states  but this period may be interrupted if a sponsor of a competitive product that is otherwise the same drug for the same use can show that its drug is clinically superior to our orphan drug candidate 
the european exclusivity period is ten years  but may be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation  including where it is shown that the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified 
in addition  european regulations establish that a competitor s marketing authorization for a similar product with the same indication may be granted if there is an insufficient supply of the product or if another applicant can establish that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior 
if a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product competitive with eb before we do and if the competitor s product is the same drug with the same indication as ours  we would be excluded from the market  unless we can show that our drug is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior 
even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for eb for these indications  we may not be able to maintain it if a competitor with a product that is otherwise the same drug can establish that its product is clinically superior 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are not able to maintain adequate patent protection for our product candidates and product candidates  we may be unable to prevent our competitors from using our technology or technology that we license 
our success also will depend in substantial part on our ability to obtain  defend and enforce patents  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and abroad 
pursuant to a research agreement with the george washington university  we have rights to two us patents relating to the treatment of septic shock 
we also own patents related to the use of t  among other thymic peptides  for the stimulation of hair growth 
pursuant to an exclusive world wide license from the nih  we have exclusive rights under a patent application filed by the nih for the use of t in the treatment of non healing wounds 
while this patent has issued in certain countries  we cannot guarantee whether or when the patent will be issued or as to the scope of the patent issued in other countries 
we have attempted to create a substantial intellectual property portfolio  submitting patent applications for various compositions of matter  methods of use and fragments and derivatives of t we have also in licensed other intellectual property rights from third parties that could be subject to the same risks as our own patents 
if any of these patent applications do not issue  or do not issue in certain countries  or are not enforceable  the ability to commercialize t in various medical indications could be substantially limited or eliminated 
in addition  the patent positions of the technologies being developed by us and our collaborators involve complex legal and factual uncertainties 
as a result  we cannot assure you that any patent applications filed by us  or by others under which we have rights  will result in patents being issued in the united states or foreign countries 
in addition  there can be no assurance that i any patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications of ours or our collaborators  ii the scope of any patent protection will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages  iii any patents obtained by us or our collaborators will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or iv others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights we or our collaborators may hold 
unauthorized parties may try to copy aspects of our product candidates and technologies or obtain and use information we consider proprietary 
policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
we cannot guarantee that no harm or threat will be made to our or our collaborators intellectual property 
in addition  changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries may also adversely affect the scope of our patent protection and our competitive situation 
due to the significant time lag between the filing of patent applications and the publication of such patents  we cannot be certain that our licensors were the first to file the patent applications we license or  even if they were the first to file  also were the first to invent  particularly with regards to patent rights in the united states 
in addition  a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to our operations 
some of these technologies  applications or patents may conflict with our or our licensors technologies or patent applications 
a conflict could limit the scope of the patents  if any  that we or our licensors may be able to obtain or result in denial of our or our licensors patent applications 
if patents that cover our activities are issued to other companies  we may not be able to develop or obtain alternative technology 
additionally  there is certain subject matter that is patentable in the united states but not generally patentable outside of the united states 
differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in various countries may limit the protection we can obtain outside of the united states 
for example  methods of treating humans are not patentable in many countries outside of the united states 
these and other issues may prevent us from obtaining patent protection outside of the united states  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes to us patent laws could materially reduce any value our patent portfolio may have 
the value of our patents depends in part on their duration 
a shorter period of patent protection could lesson the value of our rights under any patents that may be obtained and may decrease revenues derived from its patents 
the united states patent laws were amended in to change the term of patent protection years from patent issuance to years from the earliest effective filing date of the application 
because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more than three years depending on the subject matter  a year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection 
this would shorten our period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that we might derive from the patents and the value of our patent portfolio 
we may not have adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition to our patents  we also rely on trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
however  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology 
to protect our trade secrets  we may enter into confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and potential collaborators 
however  we may not have such agreements in place with all such parties and  where we do  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
also  our trade secrets or know how may become known through other means or be independently discovered by our competitors 
any of these events could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates 
we may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former employers 
as is commonplace in the biotechnology industry  we employ now  and may hire in the future  individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  including competitors or potential competitors 
although there are no claims currently pending against us  we may be subject to claims that we or certain employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and would be a significant distraction to management 
risks related to our securities our common stock price is volatile  our stock is highly illiquid  and any investment in our stock could decline substantially in value 
during the year ended december   our closing stock price has ranged from to with an average daily trading volume of  shares 
in light of our small size and limited resources  as well as the uncertainties and risks that can affect our business and industry  our stock price is expected to continue to be highly volatile and can be subject to substantial drops  with or even in the absence of news affecting our business 
the following factors  in addition to the other risk factors described in this report  and the potentially low volume of trades in our common stock  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  some of which are beyond our control results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  commercial success of approved products  corporate partnerships  technological innovations by us or competitors  changes in laws and government regulations both in the us and overseas  changes in key personnel at our company  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  public perception relating to the commercial value or safety of any of our product candidates  future sales of our common stock  future issuance of our common stock causing dilution  anticipated or unanticipated changes in our financial performance  and general trends related to the biopharmaceutical and biotechnological industries  and general conditions in the stock market 
the stock market in general has recently experienced relatively large price and volume fluctuations 
in particular  the market prices of securities of smaller biotechnology companies have experienced dramatic fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies 
continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of the common stock  which could cause a decline in the value of the common stock 
you should also be aware that price volatility may be worse if the trading volume of the common stock remains limited or declines 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock 
we have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date  and we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our business 
in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude or limit our ability to pay any dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
included in this group is sigma tau and its affiliates which together hold outstanding shares representing of our outstanding common stock 
certain shares of common stock held by sigma tau and its affiliates  representing of our outstanding common stock  are subject to voting agreements under which our board controls the voting power of such stock 
we cannot assure you that such voting agreements would prevent sigma tau and its affiliates from taking actions not in your best interests and effectively exercising control over us 
in addition  these voting agreements expire with respect to securities representing of our outstanding common stock on february  and with respect to securities representing of our outstanding common stock on june  after such time  we will have no control over the voting and disposition of these securities  including with respect to the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
currently  we are authorized to issue up to  shares of our common stock  and as of march   there were issued and outstanding  shares of our common stock 
the authorized but unissued shares may be issued by us in such transactions and at such times as our board considers appropriate  whether in public or private offerings  as stock splits or dividends or in connection with mergers and acquisitions or otherwise 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock 
as of march   directors  officers and ten percent stockholders hold  shares of our common stock and may sell such shares at their discretion subject to certain contractual and regulatory limitations 
the exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock will dilute your interest 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at prices ranging from per share to per share  of which options to purchase  shares were exercisable as of such date 
as of march   there were outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  at a weighted average exercise price of 
the exercise of options and warrants at prices below the market price of our common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock 
additional dilution may result from the issuance of shares of our capital stock in connection with collaborations or manufacturing arrangements or in connection with other financing efforts 
any issuance of our common stock that is not made solely to then existing stockholders proportionate to their interests as in a stock dividend or stock split will result in dilution to each stockholder by reducing his or her percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares 
moreover  to the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or we issue restricted stock  stockholders may experience further dilution 
holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series 
our certificate of incorporation  our rights agreement and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover  even if such a transaction would be in your best interests 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  under our rights agreement  our board has the discretion to issue certain rights to purchase our capital stock when a person acquires in excess of of our outstanding common shares 
these provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take corporate actions and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control  even if such actions or change in control would be in your best interests 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
subject to specified exceptions  this section provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company 
the foregoing factors could reduce the price that investors or an acquirer might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

item selected financial data 
not applicable 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our operations consist primarily of pre clinical studies and clinical trials related to the development of product candidates based on thymosin beta t  a amino acid peptide 
currently  we are developing three t based drug formulations including rgn  a topically applied gel product candidate for chronic dermal wounds  rgn  a sterile eye drop for ophthalmic injuries  and rgn  a parenteral injectable formulation for systemic delivery anticipated to be used in our planned phase ii acute myocardial infarction ami  or heart attack trial 
we are currently sponsoring  in parallel  three phase ii dermal wound healing clinical trials using rgn  a phase ii ophthalmic wound healing trial using rgn  and a phase ia clinical trial utilizing rgn to support our cardiovascular clinical program 
under our phase ii investigational new drug application ind  an affiliate of our largest stockholder is conducting one of the phase ii dermal wound healing clinical trials in the european union and has assumed all associated costs 
accordingly  we are primarily responsible for the costs associated with the other four trials 
we have never generated revenues  and we do not expect to generate revenues until the fda approves one of our product candidates  if ever  and we begin marketing it 
we expect to invest increasingly significant amounts in the furtherance of our current clinical programs and may add additional pre clinical studies and new clinical trials as we explore the potential of our current product candidates in other indications and or explore new formulations of t based product candidates 
consequently  we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
also  we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional outside capital in order to meet these capital requirements 
we cannot assure you that such capital will be available when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities r d and general and administrative g a activities 
r d costs include all of the wholly allocable costs associated with our various clinical programs passed through to us by our outsourced vendors 
those costs include manufacturing tb  formulation of tb into the various product candidates  stability for both tb and the various formulations  pre clinical toxicology  safety and pharmacokinetic studies  clinical trial management  medical oversight  laboratory evaluations  statistical data analysis  regulatory compliance  quality assurance  and other related activities 
r d also includes cash and non cash compensation  employee benefits  travel and other miscellaneous costs of our internal r d personnel  seven persons in total  who are wholly dedicated to r d efforts 
r d also includes a pro ration of our common infrastructure costs for office space  and communications 
we expense our r d costs as they are incurred 
r d expenditures are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials and the fda review and approval process 
as a result  these expenses could exceed our expectations  possibly materially 
we are uncertain as to what we expect to incur in future research and development costs for our pre clinical studies as these amounts are subject to the outcome of current pre clinical studies  management s continuing assessment of the economics of each individual research and development project and the internal competition for project funding 
g a costs include outside professional fees for legal  audit and accounting services  including the costs to maintain our intellectual property portfolio  review  draft and negotiate various financing  manufacturing and other corporate documents  research and conclude on appropriate financial reporting issues  sarbanes oxley compliance  and financial audits required by the securities and exchange commission 
g a also includes cash and non cash compensation  employee benefits  travel and other miscellaneous costs of our internal g a personnel  three in total  who are wholly dedicated to g a efforts 
g a includes a proration of our common infrastructure costs for office space  and communications 
critical accounting policies 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows share based payment 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted to employees after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with statement no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of statement no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to statement no 
r adoption  we accounted for share based payments to employees under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
since our historical data is limited  the expected life was determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
guidance for plain vanilla options 
since our historical trading volume is relatively low  we estimated the expected volatility based on monthly closing prices for a period consistent with the expected life of the option 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation and the relative ranges of our historical  underlying assumptions 
costs of pre clinical studies and clinical trials 
we accrue estimated costs for pre clinical studies and clinical trials conducted by contract research organizations and participating hospitals 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue costs for pre clinical studies and clinical trials performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up hospital sites for participation in trials are accrued immediately 
hospital costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
this statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin  and determined that the impact had no material effect on our financial statements 
in september  and february the fasb issued fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas  respectively 
both standards prescribe changes to fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities and are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not anticipate the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf concludes that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if and when an entity no longer expects to receive the goods or services contracted  any remaining capitalized  nonrefundable  advance payments should then be charged to expense 
this consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  historically we expense nonrefundable advance payments when paid 
we have determined that approximately  in qualifying transactions require capitalization in accordance with eitf as of january  in order to adopt the provisions of this statement  we will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of that date

results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
for the year ended december   our revenue decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  versus approximately  in our revenue in consisted entirely of costs recoverable as revenue through our grant from the nih for the orphan indication eb  which amounted to  less than they were in the reduced level of costs recoverable was primarily due to the fact that in the recoverable costs were a combination of both cro and site initiation expenses as well as patient treatment expenses 
in the majority of sites had previously been initiated so the costs were primarily a function of patient care and ongoing trial management 
we have approximately  remaining to be claimed under this grant and expect to claim those costs during expenses research and development 
for the year ended december   our r d  expenditures increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million  versus approximately million in outsourced r d expenditures  those costs incurred to make and formulate our drug candidates and manage our pre clinical and clinical activities  accounted for approximately  of the overall increase  rising to approximately million 
outsource r d expenditures included increases of approximately  related to our ophthalmic trial   for the purchase of tb   for our phase i parenteral trial   for research projects and  for clinical drug supply 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in expenses related to two of our phase ii dermal trials 
in addition  cash and non cash compensation expenses and employee benefits  increased by approximately  or  in to a total of approximately  including approximately  of non cash compensation expense 
this increase is in line with our weighted average increase in full time equivalent fte employees  which increased during the same period 
during we hired a director of product manufacturing to oversee non gmp and gmp manufacturing of our various drug formulations  and a clinical research associate to oversee our clinical site operations 
these new employees in combination with a full year s worth of employment of r d personnel hired mid account for the fte increase 
in addition  other miscellaneous r d costs increased by approximately  or  in to a total of approximately  this increase is attributable primarily to increases in costs associated with outside consulting  overhead allocations and travel  which each increased by approximately   and  respectively 
outside consulting costs rose as we expanded our clinical programs and we placed certain research experts on retainer to advise us on our clinical development 
overhead allocations rose as a function of the increase in our r d personnel relative to our general and administrative personnel 
this yielded a higher allocation of our core infrastructure costs to r d 
finally  with an increase in the number of clinical sites  the expansion of our clinical programs  and the addition of a clinical research associate who travels frequently  our travel costs have increased 
expenses general and administrative 
for the year ended december   our g a  expenses increased by approximately  or  to approximately million  versus approximately million in the majority  approximately  of the increase was attributable to increased outside professional fees 
these increased costs were due to increased costs to maintain our increasing intellectual property portfolio 
cash and non cash compensation expenses and employee benefits increased in by approximately  or  to a total of approximately  including  of non cash compensation expense 
approximately  of this increase in compensation expense is due to the increase in non cash compensation expenses recognized as a result of the issuance of stock options in the first quarter of the remaining increase in compensation expense of  is attributable to a cost of living increase in salaries of and slightly higher discretionary and non discretionary bonus payments in all other g a costs in decreased by approximately  or  due primarily to a reduction in outside investor relation services 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
for the year ended december   our revenues totaled approximately  we did not have revenues in in  we were awarded a grant from the nih for our orphan indication eb 
consequently  we were able to claim reimbursement for qualifying costs incurred under this grant during which amounted to  those qualifying costs were incurred from may  through december  and related to trial management by our cro  site initiations and patient care 
expenses research and development 
for the year ended december   our r d expenditures increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million  versus approximately million in this increase resulted from the increased r d activities that we undertook in as clinical development progressed 
during  some pre clinical activities were active in the first half of the year  clinical drug formulation activities concluded on our dermal gel product candidate  and phase ii clinical dermal trials commenced in the later half of the year 
during we continued to manage our phase ii clinical dermal trials throughout the year and expanded our clinical development program into the cardiac and ophthalmic areas 
specifically  drug formulation  protocol development  contractor selection  and site qualification were commenced during for our planned myocardial infarction and ophthalmic wound healing trials 
to manage these expanding research efforts  we increased our research staffing from a weighted average ftes in to ftes in  a increase 
coincident with our expanded development was the need to supply increasingly larger amounts of tb  along with a significant increase in outsourced contract activity 
all of these expanded efforts increased our research and development costs 
expenses general and administrative 
for the year ended december   our g a expenditures increased by approximately  or  to approximately million 
during april of  we hired a chief financial officer  which increased our weighted average ftes from to in  a increase 
we also implemented employee benefits in in order to help attract employees 
the resulting increase in payroll and benefits cash expenses for these items  along with the annual cost of living increase amounted to approximately  or  over as a direct result of our implementation of sfas r  non cash equity compensation expense increased by approximately  to approximately  in offsetting these increases was a decrease in the amount of legal fees expended in support of our patent portfolio of approximately 
all other costs of a general and administrative nature for increased by approximately  or 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to the fact that we had just completed a sale of common stock at the end of and used the proceeds from that transaction to finance operations throughout in february we concluded a million private placement of common stock with affiliates of sigma tau see note to the notes to the financial statements for more details 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net loss in was approximately million higher than our net cash used in operating activities in the same period 
our net loss in was approximately million higher than our net cash used in operating activities in the same period 
the million increase in of our net operating loss over net cash used in operations was due primarily to the following i we purchased and expensed approximately  of tb at the end of and paid for that purchase in the first quarter of  ii our non cash compensation expenses for were approximately  more than and iii we recorded approximately  more in grant revenue in than we received in cash 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both years the level of fixed asset investment was less than  leaving the net remainder attributable to investments in and sales of short term  highly liquid  investment grade financial instruments 
depending on whether these financial instruments have a maturity date  at time of purchase  of more than days from the date of purchase  the financial instrument is either classified as a short term investment on our balance sheet which is reflected in investing activities  or it is classified as a cash equivalent which is not so reflected 
we had more net qualifying short term investments in than in as a result of our cash management activity 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amounts provided in relate solely to the exercise of warrants 
in  we completed two issuances of common stock that netted approximately million after deducting the costs of the transactions 
in  we also received proceeds of  upon the exercise of warrants 
future funding requirements the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we have three proprietary product candidates in clinical trials  development of which is primarily accomplished through cancellable third party contracts 
we are committed under an office space lease that expires on december  that requires monthly rental payments of  scheduled to increase by in calendar we expect our r d expenses to trend higher as our product candidates advance through the various stages of clinical development 
the length of time required for clinical trials varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
some of the factors that could impact our liquidity and capital needs include  but are not limited to the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our pre clinical development activities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property claims  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory purposes and commercialization of drug supply associated with our product candidates  our ability to enter into corporate collaborations and the terms and success of these collaborations  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities 
in addition  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
also  we test our potential product candidates in numerous pre clinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
also  our proprietary product candidates also have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
historically  the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
we have not commercialized any of our product candidates to date and  since our inception we have primarily financed our operations through the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants in private and public financings 
since a number of significant budgeted items are discretionary and based on our capital resources as of the date of this report and including the proceeds of a million private placement of common stock with affiliates of sigma tau see note in the notes to the financial statements for more details  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations through the fourth quarter of  without considering the benefits of any potential future milestone payments that we may receive under our current collaborations  see material agreements in item business 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain such milestones and generate any such payments 
accordingly  we expect to continue to seek funding through public and private financings in the future 
however  as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects 
potential sources of outside capital include entering into strategic business relationships  public or private sales of shares of our capital stock  or debt  or other similar financial instruments 
while we recently closed a private placement of million in common stock and warrants to purchase common stock involving certain of our existing investors  we do not have any other committed sources of outside capital at this time 
consequently  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital in sufficient amounts  on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital through such a strategic business relationship  we may have to give up valuable short and or long term rights to intellectual property 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be significantly diluted 
in addition  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities  these securities are likely to have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock and may involve significant fees  interest expense  restrictive covenants and the granting of security interests in our assets 
our failure to successfully address ongoing liquidity requirements would have a materially negative impact on our business  including the possibility of surrendering our rights to some technologies or product opportunities  delaying our clinical trials  or ceasing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable securities  which are composed primarily of investment grade corporate bonds  us government agency debt securities and asset backed securities  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
due to the short term nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in fair value would not be material
