overview we were organized as a massachusetts corporation in and reincorporated under the laws of delaware in since our founding  we have established a year track record of innovation in rf  microwave and millimeterwave semiconductor technology 
from to  our principal activity was government sponsored research and development relating to advanced  application specific radio frequency integrated circuits  or rfics  and monolithic microwave integrated circuits  or mmics  primarily for military and other government related programs 
during this period  we developed many innovative technologies that we continue to incorporate in our products today 
in  we began to transition our focus from government sponsored research and development activities to the design  development and production of our own ics  modules and subsystems 
our early products were custom mmics designed for use in specific defense programs  such as radar applications 
in  we published our first catalog  which contained standard products  and began to expand our operations to support our growing commercial business 
we also established a dedicated direct technical sales force to promote our emerging standard product line 
in  we opened our first international sales office in the united kingdom  and began to focus on expanding our international business 
we have since opened sales and technical support offices in china  germany  korea and sweden  to complement our united states offices 
in february  we announced the opening of our first office in japan 
in  we derived of our revenue from customers outside the united states 
in  we established our first remote design center in istanbul  turkey 
in july  we sold  shares of common stock in an initial public offering at per share  for net proceeds  after the underwriting discount and offering costs  of  related to the initial public offering  in july   shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of our common stock 
in april  our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the aggregate amount of  which was paid to those persons who were holders of record of our common stock and of our series a preferred stock on june  in august  we acquired substantially all the assets and employees of q dot  inc  a research and development organization based in colorado springs  colorado 
in december  we opened a design center in ottawa  ontario  canada 
in  we introduced the th annual edition of our product catalog 
we currently offer more than standard products in our catalog and many more custom products  spanning product lines 
in october  we entered into a strategic agreement with northrop grumman space technology sector to market a specified list of existing velocium products worldwide  to license related technology and to assume the associated customer relationships  at a cost of million 
we employ a fabless business strategy  which means that we do not own a semiconductor fabrication facility  or fab  and purchase all of our semiconductor wafer requirements from third party wafer fabrication facilities  known as foundries 
we believe that our fabless business model enables us to access a broad range of technologies and quickly respond to new market opportunities  while significantly reducing our capital requirements 
description of our revenue  costs and expenses revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of standard and custom products 
we develop standard products from our own specifications  which we sell through our direct sales organization  our network of sales representatives  a distributor and our website 
we also develop custom products to meet the specialized requirements of individual customers  which are sold by our direct sales organization 
we sell our products to oems  that supply advanced electronic systems to commercial and military end users  and to these oems contract manufacturers 
in general  the decision to purchase our product is made by the oem  which has designed our product into its system 
in the event that we sell to an oem s contract manufacturer  the contract manufacturer typically does not have discretion to replace our product with one from a different supplier 
our sales cycle varies substantially  ranging from a period of a month or less when a customer selects a standard product from our catalog or website  to as long as two years or more for custom products 
in the sales process  our sales and application engineers work closely with the oem customer to analyze the customer s system requirements and select an appropriate standard product or establish a technical specification for a custom product 
in the case of a custom product  we also select a semiconductor process and foundry  and evaluate test wafers and finished components before manufacturing in commercial quantities can begin 
volume purchases of our products by an oem customer  or its contract manufacturer  generally do not occur until the oem customer has made the decision to begin production of the system incorporating our product 
our receipt of substantial revenue from sales of a product to an oem customer depends on that customer s commercial success in manufacturing and selling its system incorporating our product 
it may take several years for a newly introduced standard product to generate substantial revenue  if ever 
however  the life cycles of our standard products tend to be lengthy 
although most of our revenue is derived from sales of our products  we also receive a small percentage of our revenue from customer sponsored research and development activities 
these activities range from pure research  in which we investigate ic design techniques on new semiconductor technologies at the request of a government agency or commercial customer  to custom development projects in which we are paid to enhance or modify an existing product or develop a new product to meet a customer s specifications 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers that we purchase from our foundries and other materials such as packages  epoxies  connectors and production masks 
cost of revenue also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering operations  including occupancy and equipment costs  shipping costs  charges for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations and amortization of certain intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our research and development organization  costs of development wafers  license fees for computer aided design software  costs of development testing and evaluation  costs of developing automated test software  and related occupancy and equipment costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing organization  sales commissions paid to independent sales representatives  costs of advertising  trade shows  corporate marketing  promotion  travel  related occupancy and equipment costs  amortization of certain intangible assets and other marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our executive management  finance  and other administrative staff  outside professional fees  related occupancy and equipment costs and other corporate expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  warranty obligations  accrued expenses and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
the accounting policies described below are those which  in our opinion  involve the most significant application of judgment  or involve complex estimation  and which could  if different judgments or estimates were made  materially affect our reported results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon shipment  provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  we record revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue earned on these arrangements is allocated among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
we maintain a reserve for potential returns or allowances on these sales 
returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
a portion of our sales are made to a distributor under an agreement that provides for limited product return privileges 
as a result  we defer recognition of such revenue until the product is resold by the distributor 
revenue from contracts with the united states government or its subcontractors and some commercial customers is recorded under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
generally  revenue from these contracts is recorded on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed are reported as unbilled receivables 
contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule 
contract costs include material  subcontract costs  labor and an allocation of indirect costs 
the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract 
changes in contract performance and estimated profitability  including final contract settlements  are recognized in the period in which the changes are determined 
estimated losses on a contract are recognized in full in the period when they become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the inventory and compare product costs with current market value  and write down any with costs in excess of current market value to its net realizable value 
estimating demand is inherently difficult  particularly given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
although we did not record significant expense for excess or obsolete inventory in  or  the number of products we offer is increasing  which may expose us to increased inventory risk and may  in the future  require us to record higher expense for excess or obsolete inventory 
once we have written down inventory to its estimated net realizable value  we establish a new cost basis for that inventory and do not increase its carrying value due to subsequent changes in demand forecasts 
accordingly  if inventory previously written down is subsequently sold  we may realize improved gross profit margins on these transactions 
business combinations 
the purchase price of an acquisition accounted for as a purchase business combination is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
significant management judgment and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangibles 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangibles is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for potential impairment under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform these evaluations whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance 
indicators of potential impairment include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the business or industry in which the asset is used or sold  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset  and significant advances in our technologies that require changes in one or more of our manufacturing processes 
if we believe that an indicator of potential impairment exists  we test to determine whether the impairment recognition criteria in sfas no 
have been met 
to analyze a potential impairment  we project undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset or the primary asset in the asset group  using a probability weighted multiple scenario approach  reflecting a range of possible outcomes 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset or asset group less any costs of disposition 
evaluating the impairment requires judgment by our management to estimate future operating results and cash flows 
if different estimates were used  the amount and timing of asset impairments could be affected 
we charge impairments of the long lived assets to operations if our evaluations indicate that the carrying values of these assets are not fully recoverable 
warranty obligations 
we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we would increase our warranty accrual  which would adversely impact our gross margins 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee and director stock options  to be recognized as compensation cost in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
prior to january   no compensation cost was recognized in our consolidated financial statements for stock options issued under our stock based compensation plans 
under both sfas r and apb  compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements for grants of restricted stock to employees 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and the expected life of each equity instrument 
total stock based compensation cost was   and  for  and  respectively 
we have used the modified prospective method of transition 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial position for periods prior to january   have not been restated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related assets or liabilities are settled or the reported amount of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
effective january   we adopted interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
in particular  the interpretation requires that a tax benefit related to a given tax position be reflected in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that it would be sustained on its technical merits in the event of a tax audit 
the assessment of each tax position and the application of the measurement methodology of fin requires significant judgment 
all tax positions are periodically analyzed and adjusted as a result of events  such as the resolution of tax audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in charges or credits to the provision for income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further disclosure regarding fin factors and trends that affect our results of operations in reading our financial statements  you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance 
recent revenue growth 
our revenue has grown rapidly in recent years 
from to  our revenue grew from million to million  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
from to  our revenue increased to million 
over our year history  we have experienced periods of relatively flat year over year growth  as in and  as well as periods of rapid growth  as in the period from to the principal driver of our recent revenue growth has been increased sales of our standard products  which we believe are attributable primarily to the introduction of new products  which expanded the breadth and diversity of our standard product offerings  the growing market acceptance of the standard products we introduced in prior periods  and the expansion of our domestic and international sales efforts 
although we believe we have multiple opportunities for additional revenue growth and are planning our business accordingly  we do not expect our revenue will continue to grow at rates as high as those we have recently experienced 
we believe that in planning our growth  it is prudent to take into account the cyclical nature of some of the end markets that we serve  as well as the longer term historical patterns in the development of our business 
we also believe that to some extent a decline in the rate of growth of our revenue is inevitable  as  and if  our revenue continues to increase to higher levels 
accordingly  we do not expect that our revenue will continue to grow at rates as high as those we have experienced recently  and in establishing planned levels of operating expenses we have not assumed that they will do so 
gross margin 
one of our objectives is to maintain and improve our gross margin  which is our gross profit expressed as a percentage of our revenue 
in the last three years our gross margins were in  in and in in general  we seek to introduce high performance products that are valued by our customers for their ability to address technically challenging applications  rather than commodity ics for use in high volume applications where cost  rather than performance  is the highest priority 
we also seek continuously to reduce our costs and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
our gross margin in any period is significantly affected by industry demand and the intensity of competition in the markets into which we sell our products 
gross margins are also significantly affected by product mix  that is  the percentage of our revenue in that period that is attributable to higher or lower margin products 
additional factors affecting our gross margins include changes in the cost of wafers and materials  the timing of indirect costs for pre production masks and evaluation materials  changes in estimates for contracts recognized on a percentage of completion basis  variations in overhead absorption rates and other manufacturing efficiencies  and numerous other factors  some of which are not under our control 
our margins can be substantially affected by changes in our manufacturing yields 
our yields depend on many factors that we control  such as product design and the effectiveness of our own assembly and test operations  but they are also affected by the activities of third parties  such as the foundries and packaging subcontractors that supply us with critical materials and services  which are beyond our control 
as a result of these or other factors  we may be unable to maintain or increase our gross margin in future periods 
purchasing patterns of our standard products 
a majority of our revenue in each quarter is typically derived from sales of our standard products 
purchasers of our standard products generally do not enter into long term contracts with us 
customers that purchase large volumes of our standard products generally provide us with periodic forecasts of their requirements for those products  but these forecasts do not commit the customer to minimum purchases  and customers generally may revise these forecasts without penalty 
a significant portion of our revenue in each quarter is attributable to purchase orders for standard products that are received and fulfilled in that quarter  often including a large number of orders from diverse customers and end markets 
the price list for our standard products includes discounts based on purchase order volume  and  as a result  the revenue we receive from sales of a particular product in any period is influenced by the average order size for that product during that period 
our forecasting of sales of standard products takes into account a number of factors  including historical sales patterns for each individual product  our assessment of overall market conditions and our knowledge of the current requirements and purchasing practices of our larger customers 
however  the absence  in most cases  of long term purchase commitments for our standard products complicates the task of predicting the exact sources and amount of our revenue from standard products and thus  to some extent  the amount of our total revenue in any quarter 
relationships with major customers 
we have historically depended on a small number of customers for a large percentage of our annual revenue 
revenue derived from our largest customers as a percentage of our annual revenue was in  in and in no single customer exceed of our total revenue in or in  sales to boeing accounted for of our revenue 
we include in these calculations revenue from products sold to these customers directly by us or through sales representatives and our distributor  as well as from products sold to contract manufacturers for use in a system manufactured by the contract manufacturer for that customer 
our major customers often use our products in multiple systems or programs  sometimes developed by different business units within the customer s organization  each having differing product life cycles  end customers and market dynamics 
while the composition of our top customers varies from year to year  we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  we have noted consolidation among oems in some of our end markets  which could result in an increased concentration in our sources of revenue 
challenges 
in pursuing the market opportunities before us  we face a number of challenges 
among the challenges that we think are most significant are the following need for continued product and technology innovation 
we believe that the breadth of our product line with respect to functionality  performance and frequency coverage  and our ability to introduce new products rapidly  afford us significant competitive advantage and have contributed significantly to our recent revenue growth 
for example  the number of new standard catalog products we have introduced each year has increased from in to in and in  including velocium products 
our future competitive position will depend in large part on our ability to continue to innovate  to anticipate the rapid changes in semiconductor technology and rf  microwave and millimeterwave circuit design techniques that characterize our industry and to develop  introduce and successfully market new products that meet the evolving application requirements of our customers 
driving and supporting this process of continuous innovation and new product introduction is one of our key priorities  and one that will require continuing expenditures 
need to meet customer demand for on time delivery and high quality 
the success of our business also depends on our continued ability to supply our products on time and in quantities adequate to meet our customers requirements  while maintaining the high standards of quality and reliability that our customers require 
our senior management spends a significant amount of its time on these key operational issues  and we devote substantial resources to maintain our sources of supply and to improve our manufacturing and quality control processes 
need to continue to expand the diversity of our product lines  customer base  end markets and target applications 
the semiconductor industry in general  and specific segments of the markets that we serve  are highly cyclical and have historically experienced significant fluctuations in demand  including periods of rapid growth as well as periods of product overcapacity and weak demand 
for example  our revenue growth rate was largely flat in and as a result of a downturn in the telecommunications industry 
an important objective of our management is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in demand from any particular customer or industry segment by continuing to broaden our customer base and end markets and the range of applications that our products address 
management of growth 
we recognize that if our business plans are successful  we may be required to manage a larger and growing enterprise 
to support the growth  we will have to expand our organization and structure  including hiring more management and personnel  including engineering and other specialized functions  in the us and worldwide 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of operations data in dollar amount and expressed as a percentage of our revenue years ended december  in thousands revenue    cost of revenue    gross profit    operating expenses research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    in process research and development  total operating expenses    income from operations    interest income    interest expense other income  net income before income taxes    provision for income taxes    net income    years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the growth was primarily attributable to increased sales to the microwave and millimeterwave communications  cellular infrastructure and military markets  partially offset by a decrease in sales to the broadband market 
our sales growth was primarily due to the increased breadth of our product offerings and to increased market acceptance of the products we introduced in prior years 
additionally  we believe that the productivity and effectiveness of our worldwide sales organization  including our sales offices in china  germany  korea  sweden  the united kingdom and the united states  as well as our third party sales representatives  contributed to our revenue growth 
revenue from sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenue in compared with in cost of revenue and gross margin 
our cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as a result of the increase in sales volume 
our gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to an unfavorable change in product mix  including certain low margin government contracts  and an increase in higher volume orders  on which we offer higher discounts  partially offset by a decrease in direct production material costs 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in  and represented of our revenue in compared with in the increase in our research and development expense was attributable to a million increase in personnel costs  primarily associated with the growth of our engineering organization  a million increase in depreciation and other equipment expense and a million increase in other expenses 
costs associated with our ottawa  ontario  canada design center  which opened in late december  contributed to the increase in total expense 
we believe that a significant amount of research and development activity will be required for us to remain competitive in the future 
as a result  we expect our research and development expense to increase as we expand our research and development organization and continue to invest in the development of new products 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in  and represented of our revenue in compared with in the increase in our sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs  associated with the growth of our worldwide direct sales and marketing organization  a million increase in travel costs  a million increase in third party commissions and a million net increase in other costs 
in addition  includes million of intangible asset amortization related to the velocium strategic agreement 
we expect sales and marketing expense will increase as we hire additional personnel  continue to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities  include a full year of amortization for the velocium strategic agreement and  to the extent that our revenue increases  pay additional commissions 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in and represented of our revenue in compared with in the increase in our general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs associated with the growth of our organization and a million net increase in other costs  partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees 
we expect general and administrative expense will increase as a result of additional personnel and other costs necessary to support the growth of our business 
interest income 
interest income was million in compared to million in the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in our cash and investments balances 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased million  to million in  from million in  representing an effective tax rate of in and in the effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of the increase in our tax exempt interest income and the elected tax treatment for certain federal and state deductions and incentives provided for under the american jobs creation act of  partially offset by the expiration of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in this growth in revenue was attributable to increased sales to customers of both our standard and custom products  primarily to the microwave and millimeterwave communications  cellular infrastructure  broadband and military end markets  which we believe is attributable to the increased breadth of our product offering and the market acceptance of products which we introduced in prior years 
we believe that the increased productivity and effectiveness of our worldwide sales organization  including our sales offices in china  germany  korea  sweden and the united kingdom  as well as our third party sales representatives  also contributed to our revenue growth 
revenue from sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenue in compared with in cost of revenue and gross margin 
our cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as a result of the increase in sales volume 
our gross margin increased to in from in the increase in our gross margin is primarily attributable to an improved product mix  including increased unit sales of higher margin products  a decrease in direct production material costs  an increase in lower volume orders on which we offer lower discounts  favorable absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs as a result of increased volume  and lower spending for indirect manufacturing materials  including pre production masks and evaluation materials 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in  and represented of our revenue in compared with in the increase in our research and development expense was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and the cost of equity compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas r  a million increase in spending on depreciation and other equipment expense and a million increase in other expenses 
each component of the total increase in research and development expense was attributable in part to a full year of expenses associated with our acquisition of q dot  inc on august  sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in  and represented of our revenue in compared with in the increase in our sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a million increase in third party commissions  a million increase in personnel costs associated with the expansion of our worldwide direct sales and marketing organization and the cost of equity compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas r  and a million increase in other costs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in and represented of our revenue in compared with in the increase was primarily attributable to million increase in personnel costs associated with the expansion of our organization and the cost of equity compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas r  a million increase in professional fees associated with operating and compliance as a public company  and a million increase in other expenses 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in compared to million in the increase in interest income was attributable to both an increase in our cash and investments and an increase in interest rates earned 
interest expense was million and million in and respectively 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased million  to million in  from million in  representing an effective tax rate of in and in the higher effective tax rate for reflects the impact of tax incentives related to the extraterritorial income exclusion and an increase in state income taxes as well as changes in estimates for certain tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of our cash and cash equivalents of million  short term available for sale investments of million and a million bank credit facility  from which we had no borrowings outstanding as of december  for the year ended december   cash provided by our operations was million  of which the principal components were our net income of million and non cash charges of million  partially offset by a net increase in deferred taxes of million and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in net operating assets and liabilities includes increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million  due to the growth of our business  and an increase in other net operating assets of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  due to the growth of our business and the timing of disbursements 
we invested million in the purchase of capital equipment in  primarily for engineering and production equipment  as well as engineering design software 
we invested million in short term available for sale investments and received million in proceeds from the sales and maturities of such securities in the normal course of business 
in october  we entered into a strategic agreement with northrop grumman space technology sector to market a specified list of existing velocium products worldwide  to license related technology and to assume the associated customer relationships  at a cost of million 
during  we received million from the exercise of stock options and million from the tax benefit related to these exercises 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and introduction of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
there is no assurance that additional financing  if required or desired  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
backlog we typically do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and our revenue in any period is dependent to a significant extent on orders for standard products booked and shipped in that period 
additionally  despite the existence of contractual penalties  our customers from time to time cancel or delay scheduled purchases 
as a result  we use backlog for purposes of scheduling production but do not consider it to be an accurate indicator of sales for any future period 
generally  we include in our backlog all accepted purchase orders for which the customer has specified a delivery date within the next months  and long term production contracts that require longer than months to perform 
at december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fin fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns
