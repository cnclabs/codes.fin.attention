general we manufacture  market  distribute and sell natural  organic  specialty and snack food products and natural personal care products under brand names which are sold as better for you products 
we are a leader in many of the top natural food and personal care products categories 
our products are sold primarily to specialty and natural food distributors and are marketed to supermarkets  natural food stores  and other retail classes of trade including mass market retailers  drug store chains  food service channels and club stores 
we manufacture internationally and our products are sold in more than countries 
our brand names are well recognized in the various market categories they serve 
we have acquired numerous brands since our formation and we will seek future growth through internal expansion as well as the acquisition of complementary brands 
we consider the acquisition of natural and organic food and personal products companies and product lines as an integral part of our business strategy 
we believe that by integrating our various brands  we will achieve economies of scale and enhanced market penetration 
our business strategy is to integrate all of our brands under one management team and employ a uniform marketing  sales and distribution program 
we capitalize on our brand equity and the distribution achieved through each of our acquisitions with strategic introductions of new products that complement existing lines to enhance revenues and margins 
our consolidated net sales increased in fiscal compared to the year earlier period as a result of growth in our existing brands and the impact of acquisitions 
during the three fiscal years ended june   we made a number of acquisitions  which expanded our product offerings in fast growing categories and complemented our existing brands we acquired avalon natural products  inc  with its avalon organics and alba botanica brand of personal care products  nspired natural foods  inc  with its maranatha natural and organic nut butters and sunspire natural and organic chocolate products and spectrum organic products  inc  a leading manufacturer and marketer of natural and organic culinary oils  vinegars  condiments and butter substitutes under the spectrum naturals brand and nutritional supplements under the spectrum essentials brand 
we expanded the scope of our european operations with the acquisitions of the fresh prepared food business based in luton  england from the hj heinz company  hj  the linda mccartney brand under license frozen meat free business based in the united kingdom and daily bread  ltd  a london based producer of branded fresh prepared foods for the foodservice channel in the united kingdom 
we entered the specialty poultry business with the formation of hain pure protein corporation  a owned subsidiary 
hain pure protein has since acquired the natural  organic and antibiotic free chicken business of college hill poultry  the assets and business of plainville turkey farm  inc  a leading supplier of natural and antibiotic free whole turkeys and deli turkey products and a turkey production facility and distribution center in new oxford  pennsylvania 
all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases 
consequently  their operations are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
in august   we sold our interest in a joint venture in belgium that manufactured and sold rice cakes 
in september  we sold our minority interest in halo  purely for pets  inc  which we had acquired in fiscal in 
table of contents august   we sold our biomarch operations  a belgium based provider of fresh organic fruits and vegetables  which we acquired in fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have consistently applied 
our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized when the earnings process is complete  which occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements  title and risk of loss transfer to customers  collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable 
sales are reported net of sales incentives  which include trade discounts and promotions and certain coupon costs 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in reported sales 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years 
while one of our customers represented approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred during the most recent three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change in the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of actual cost or market  utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and provide for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within the ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment exists by analyzing underlying cash flow projections 
at this time  we believe no impairment exists on the carrying value of such assets 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 

table of contents accounting for acquisitions part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses 
the purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business  market research  strategic planning  and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies 
estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources 
our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment 
these estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  operating leases and deferred income taxes 
we complete these assessments as soon as practical 
we are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in fiscal would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with some of our acquisitions  we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings 
our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities  reductions in staffing levels  and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire 
the estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and  as such  affect the ultimate recording of goodwill consistent with the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
it is typical for us to rationalize the product lines of businesses acquired within the first year or two after an acquisition 
these rationalizations often include elimination of portions of the product lines acquired  the reformulation of recipes and formulas used to produce the products  and the elimination of customers that do not meet our credit standards 
in certain instances  it is necessary to change co packers used to produce the products 
each of these activities soon after an acquisition may have the effect of reducing sales to a level lower than that of the business acquired and operated prior to our acquisition 
as a result  pro forma information regarding sales cannot and should not be construed as representative of our growth rates 
stock based compensation we provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options and restricted stock to employees and non employee directors under several stock based plans 
we account for stock based awards in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that share based compensation be measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in the consolidated statement of income over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight line method 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the option  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight line method 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only that portion of stock based awards that are expected to vest 
we utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates 
if the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management  adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods 
segments sfas no 
defines an operating segment as that component of an enterprise i that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance  and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
sfas no 

table of contents defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that it operates in one segment  the sale of natural and organic products  including food  beverage and personal care products  and further that such single segment includes six reporting units in the annual test of goodwill for impairment 
characteristics of the company s operations which are relied on in making these determinations include the similarities apparent in the company s products in the natural and organic consumer markets  the commonality of the company s customers across brands  the company s unified marketing strategy  and the nature of the financial information used by the codm  described below  other than information on sales and direct product costs  by brand 
the company s six reporting units are grocery including snacks  tea  personal care  protein  canada  and europe 
the company has further determined that its chairman of the board and chief executive officer is the company s codm as defined in sfas no 
 and is also the manager of the company s single segment 
in making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment  the company s codm focuses on sales performance by brand using internally generated sales data as well as externally developed market consumption data acquired from independent sources  and further reviews certain data regarding standard costs and standard gross margins by brand 
in making these decisions  the codm receives and reviews certain company consolidated quarterly and year to date information  however  the codm does not receive or review any discrete financial information by geographic location  business unit  subsidiary  division or brand 
the codm reviews and approves capital spending on a company consolidated basis rather than at any lower unit level 
the company s board of directors receives the same quarterly and year to date information as the company s codm 
intangibles goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
the carrying value of goodwill  which is allocated to the company s six reporting units  and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  and include the use of management projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance and expected cash flows of the operations 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions  the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities and other factors

quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
impact of inflation inflation has caused increased ingredient  fuel  labor and benefits costs and in some cases has materially increased our operating expenses 
for more information regarding ingredient costs  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ingredient inputs price risk 
to the extent permitted by competition  we seek to recover increased costs through a combination of price increases  new product innovation and by implementing process efficiencies and cost reductions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses  and ingredient inputs 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents  considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
as of june   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
assuming current cash equivalents and variable rate borrowings  a hypothetical change in average interest rates of one percentage point would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows over the next fiscal year 

table of contents foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and of net sales in we expect sales from non us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  compliance with applicable foreign laws  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors 
ingredient inputs price risk the company purchases ingredient inputs such as wheat  corn  soybeans  canola oil and fruit as well as packaging materials to be used in its operations 
these inputs are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk 
we do not attempt to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the ingredients by using future  forward  option or other derivative instruments 
as a result  the majority of our future purchases of these items are subject to changes in price 
we may enter into fixed purchase commitments in an attempt to secure an adequate supply of specific ingredients 
these agreements are tied to specific market prices 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of our primary inputs as of june  based on our cost of goods sold during the twelve months ended june   such a change would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales of approximately million 
we attempt to offset the impact of input cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers
