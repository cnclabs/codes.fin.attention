the company s highest loan demand occurs generally from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand is generally lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
consequently  the company experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in its operating results and cash needs 
operating results from the company s third fiscal quarter are generally lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are generally higher than in other quarters 
lending and collection operations 
the company seeks to provide short term loans to the segment of the population that has limited access to other sources of credit 
in evaluating the creditworthiness of potential customers  the company primarily examines the individual s discretionary income  length of current employment  duration of residence and prior credit experience 
loans are made to individuals on the basis of the customer s discretionary income and other factors and are limited to amounts that the customer can reasonably be expected to repay from that income 
all of the company s new customers are required to complete standardized credit applications in person or by telephone at local company offices 
each of the company s local offices is equipped to perform immediate background  employment and credit checks and approve loan applications promptly  often while the customer waits 
the company s employees verify the applicant s employment and credit histories through telephone checks with employers  other employment references and a variety of credit services 
substantially all new customers are required to submit a listing of personal property that will be pledged as collateral to secure the loan  but the company does not rely on the value of such collateral in the loan approval process and generally does not perfect its security interest in that collateral 
accordingly  if the customer were to default in the repayment of the loan  the company may not be able to recover the outstanding loan balance by resorting to the sale of collateral 
the company generally approves less than of applications for loans to new customers 
the company believes that the development and continual reinforcement of personal relationships with customers improve the company s ability to monitor their creditworthiness  reduce credit risk and generate repeat loans 
it is not unusual for the company to have made a number of loans to the same customer over the course of several years  many of which were refinanced with a new loan after two or three payments 
in determining whether to refinance existing loans  the company typically requires loans to be current on a recency basis  and repeat customers are generally required to complete a new credit application if they have not completed one within the prior two years 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through refinancings of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a refinancing represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
the company actively markets the opportunity to refinance existing loans prior to maturity  thereby increasing the amount borrowed and increasing the fees and other income realized 
for fiscal  and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were refinancings of existing loans were  and  respectively 
the company allows refinancing of delinquent loans on a case by case basis for those customers who otherwise satisfy the company s credit standards 
each such refinancing is carefully examined before approval in an effort to avoid increasing credit risk 
a delinquent loan may generally be refinanced only if the customer has made payments which  together with any credits of insurance premiums or other charges to which the customer is entitled in connection with the refinancing  reduce the balance due on the loan to an amount equal to or less than the original cash advance made in connection with the loan 
the company does not allow the amount of the new loan to exceed the original amount of the existing loan 
the company believes that refinancing delinquent loans for certain customers who have made periodic payments allows the company to increase its average loans outstanding and its interest  fee and other income without experiencing a significant increase in loan losses 
these refinancings also provide a resolution to temporary financial setbacks for these borrowers and sustain their credit rating 
while allowed on a selective basis  refinancings of delinquent loans amounted to less than of the company s loan volume in fiscal to reduce late payment risk  local office staff encourage customers to inform the company in advance of expected payment problems 
local office staff also promptly contact delinquent customers following any payment due date and thereafter remain in close contact with such customers through phone calls  letters or personal visits to the customer s residence or place of employment until payment is received or some other resolution is reached 
when representatives of the company make personal visits to delinquent customers  the company s policy is to encourage the customers to return to the company s office to make payment 
company employees are instructed not to accept payment outside of the company s offices except in unusual circumstances 
in georgia  oklahoma  and illinois  the company is permitted under state laws to garnish customers wages for repayment of loans  but the company does not otherwise generally resort to litigation for collection purposes  and rarely attempts to foreclose on collateral 
insurance related operations 
in georgia  louisiana  south carolina  kentucky  and on a limited basis  alabama  new mexico  oklahoma  and tennessee  the company sells credit insurance to customers in connection with its loans as an agent for an unaffiliated insurance company 
these insurance policies provide for the payment of the outstanding balance of the company s loan upon the occurrence of an insured event 
the company earns a commission on the sale of such credit insurance  which is based in part on the claims experience of the insurance company on policies sold on its behalf by the company 
the company has a wholly owned  captive insurance subsidiary that reinsures a portion of the credit insurance sold in connection with loans made by the company 
certain coverages currently sold by the company on behalf of the unaffiliated insurance carrier are ceded by the carrier to the captive insurance subsidiary  providing the company with an additional source of income derived from the earned reinsurance premiums 
in fiscal  the captive insurance subsidiary reinsured approximately of the credit insurance sold by the company and contributed approximately  to the company s total revenues 
the company typically does not perfect its security interest in collateral securing its smaller loans by filing uniform commercial code ucc financing statements 
statutes in georgia  louisiana  south carolina  tennessee  missouri  kentucky and alabama permit the company to charge a non file or non recording insurance premium in connection with certain loans originated in these states 
these premiums are equal in aggregate amount to the premiums paid by the company to purchase non file insurance coverage from an unaffiliated insurance company 
under its non file insurance coverage  the company is reimbursed for losses on loans resulting from its policy not to perfect its security interest in collateral pledged to secure the loans 
the company generally perfects its security interest in collateral on larger loan transactions typically greater than  by filing ucc financing statements 
monitoring and supervision 
the company s loan operations are organized into southern  central  and western divisions  and mexico 
the southern division consists of south carolina  georgia  louisiana and alabama  the central division consists of tennessee  illinois  missouri  and kentucky  and the western division consists of texas  oklahoma  and new mexico 
several levels of management monitor and supervise the operations of each of the company s offices 
branch managers are directly responsible for the performance of their respective offices and must approve all credit applications 
district supervisors are responsible for the performance of to offices in their districts  typically communicate with the branch managers of each of their offices at least weekly and visit the offices at least monthly 
each of the state vice presidents of operations monitor the performance of all offices within their states or partial state in the case of texas  primarily through communication with district supervisors 
these vice presidents of operations typically communicate with the district supervisors of each of their districts weekly and visit each office in their states quarterly 
senior management receives daily delinquency  loan volume  charge off  and other statistical reports consolidated by state and has access to these daily reports for each branch office 
at least six times per fiscal year  district supervisors audit the operations of each office in their geographic area and submit standardized reports detailing their findings to the company s senior management 
at least once per year  each office undergoes an audit by the company s internal auditors 
these audits include an examination of cash balances and compliance with company loan approval  review and collection procedures and compliance with federal and state laws and regulations 
in fiscal the company converted all of its loan offices to a new computer system following its acquisition of paradata financial systems  a small software company located near st 
louis  missouri 
this system uses a proprietary data processing software package developed by paradata  and has enabled the company to fully automate all loan account processing and collection reporting 
the system also provides significantly enhanced management information and control capabilities 
the company also markets the system to other finance companies  but experiences significant fluctuations from year to year in the amount of revenues generated from sales of the system to third parties and does not expect such revenues to be material 
staff and training 
local offices are generally staffed with three to four employees 
the branch manager supervises operations of the office and is responsible for approving all loan applications 
each office generally has one or two assistant managers who contact delinquent customers  review loan applications and prepare operational reports 
each office also generally has one customer service representative who takes loan applications  processes loan applications  processes payments  assists in the preparation of operational reports  assists in collection efforts  and assists in marketing activities 
larger offices may employ additional assistant managers and customer service representatives 
new employees are required to review a detailed training manual that outlines the company s operating policies and procedures 
the company tests each employee on the training manual during the first year of employment 
in addition  each branch provides in office training sessions once every week and training sessions outside the office for one full day every six months 
compensation 
the company administers a performance based compensation program for all of its district supervisors and branch managers 
the company annually reviews the performance of branch managers and adjusts their base salaries based upon a number of factors  including office loan growth  delinquencies and profitability 
branch managers also receive incentive compensation based upon office profitability and delinquencies 
in addition  branch managers are paid a cash bonus for training personnel who are promoted to branch manager positions 
assistant managers and customer service representatives are paid a base salary and incentive compensation based primarily upon their office s loan volume and delinquency ratio 
advertising 
the company actively advertises through direct mail  targeting both its present and former customers and potential customers who have used other sources of consumer credit 
the company obtains or acquires mailing lists from third party sources 
in addition to the general promotion of its loans for vacations  back to school needs and other uses  the company advertises extensively during the october through december holiday season and in connection with new office openings 
the company believes its advertising contributes significantly to its ability to compete effectively with other providers of small loan consumer credit 
advertising expenses were approximately of total revenues in fiscal  in  and in competition 
the small loan consumer finance industry is highly fragmented  with numerous competitors 
the majority of the company s competitors are independent operators with generally less than offices 
competition from nationwide consumer finance businesses is limited because these companies typically do not make loans of less than  the company believes that competition between small loan consumer finance companies occurs primarily on the basis of the strength of customer relationships  customer service and reputation in the local community  rather than pricing  as participants in this industry generally charge comparable interest rates and fees 
the company believes that its relatively larger size affords it a competitive advantage over smaller companies by increasing its access to  and reducing its cost of  capital 
several of the states in which the company currently operates limit the size of loans made by small loan consumer finance companies and prohibit the extension of more than one loan to a customer by any one company 
as a result  many customers borrow from more than one finance company  enabling the company to obtain information on the credit history of specific customers from other consumer finance companies 
government regulation 
small loan consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under various federal and state statutes  ordinances and regulations 
in general  these statutes establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates and the types and maximum amounts of fees  insurance premiums and other fees that may be charged 
in addition  state laws regulate collection procedures  the keeping of books and records and other aspects of the operation of small loan consumer finance companies 
generally  state regulations also establish minimum capital requirements for each local office 
state agency approval is required to open new branch offices 
accordingly  the ability of the company to expand by acquiring existing offices and opening new offices will depend in part on obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
a texas regulation requires the approval of the texas consumer credit commissioner for the acquisition  directly or indirectly  of more than of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company 
a louisiana statute prohibits any person from acquiring control of or more of the shares of stock of a licensed consumer lender  such as the company  without first obtaining a license as a consumer lender 
the overall effect of these laws  and similar laws in other states  is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of a nonregulated corporation 
each of the company s branch offices is separately licensed under the laws of the state in which the office is located 
licenses granted by the regulatory agencies in these states are subject to renewal every year and may be revoked for failure to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations 
in the states in which the company currently operates  licenses may be revoked only after an administrative hearing 
the company and its operations are regulated by several state agencies  including the industrial loan division of the office of the georgia insurance commissioner  the consumer finance division of the south carolina board of financial institutions  the south carolina department of consumer affairs  the texas office of the consumer credit commission  the oklahoma department of consumer credit  the louisiana office of financial institutions  the tennessee department of financial institutions  the missouri division of finance  the consumer credit division of the illinois department of financial institutions  the consumer credit bureau of the new mexico financial institutions division  the kentucky department of financial institutions  and the alabama state banking department 
these state regulatory agencies audit the company s local offices from time to time  and each state agency performs an annual compliance audit of the company s operations in that state 
effective may   world acceptance corporation de mexico was converted to wac de mexico  sa de sa  sofom  sa the company is also subject to state regulations governing insurance agents in the states in which it sells credit insurance 
state insurance regulations require that insurance agents be licensed  govern the commissions that may be paid to agents in connection with the sale of credit insurance and limit the premium amount charged for such insurance 
the company s captive insurance subsidiary is regulated by the insurance authorities of the turks and caicos islands of the british west indies  where the subsidiary is organized and domiciled 
the company is subject to extensive federal regulation as well  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act and the regulations thereunder and the federal trade commission s credit practices rule 
these laws require the company to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to every prospective borrower  prohibit misleading advertising  protect against discriminatory lending practices and proscribe unfair credit practices 
among the principal disclosure items under the truth in lending act are the terms of repayment  the final maturity  the total finance charge and the annual percentage rate charged on each loan 
the equal credit opportunity act prohibits creditors from discriminating against loan applicants on the basis of race  color  sex  age or marital status 
pursuant to regulation b promulgated under the equal credit opportunity act  creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection 
the fair credit reporting act requires the company to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency 
the credit practices rule limits the types of property a creditor may accept as collateral to secure a consumer loan 
violations of the statutes and regulations described above may result in actions for damages  claims for refund of payments made  certain fines and penalties  injunctions against certain practices and the potential forfeiture of rights to repayment of loans 
consumer finance companies are affected by changes in state and federal statutes and regulations 
the company actively participates in trade associations and in lobbying efforts in the states in which it operates 
although the company is not aware of any pending or proposed legislation that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not adversely affect the company s lending practices  operations  profitability or prospects 
employees 
as of march   the company had  us employees  none of whom were represented by labor unions and employees in mexico  all of whom were represented by a labor union 
the company considers its relations with its personnel to be good 
the company seeks to hire people who will become long term employees 
the company experiences a high level of turnover among its entry level personnel  which the company believes is typical of the small loan consumer finance industry

investors should consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information presented in this annual report and the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec  in evaluating us  our business and an investment in our securities 
any of the following risks  as well as other risks  uncertainties  and possibly inaccurate assumptions underlying our plans and expectations  could result in harm to our business  results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline  which in turn could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment in our company 
these factors  among others  could also cause actual results to differ from those we have experienced in the past or those we may express or imply from time to time in any forward looking statements we make 
investors are advised that it is impossible to identify or predict all risks  and that risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also could affect us in the future 
we face liquidity risk resulting from market conditions or other events 
downturns  uncertainties or turmoil in the corporate credit markets or broader economy  political or social unrest or other events  most of which are beyond our control  could negatively affect the level or cost of our liquidity  which would adversely affect our ongoing ability to service debt  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
any substantial  unexpected and or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additional information regarding liquidity risk is included in the section captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we are subject to interest rate risk resulting from general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence the amount of interest we pay on our revolving credit facility and other note payable or any other floating interest rate obligations we may incur  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans 
if the interest we pay on our revolving credit facility increases  our earnings would be adversely affected because the company is generally charging the maximum fees allowed by the respective state s regulatory agency 
additional information regarding interest rate risk is included in the section captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and inflation 
our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk 
we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management and options to hedge foreign currency fluctuation risk 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to credit and market risk 
additional information regarding our exposure to credit and market risk is included in the section captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
our ability to collect on loans to individuals  our single largest asset group  depends on the willingness and repayment ability of our borrowers 
a material adverse change in the ability of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us  due to changes in economic conditions  the cost of consumer goods  interest rates  natural disasters  acts of war  or other causes over which we have no control  would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
controls and procedures are particularly important for small loan consumer finance companies 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the locations where we have offices may cease to be attractive as demographic patterns change 
the success of our offices is significantly influenced by location 
current locations may not continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change 
it is possible that the neighborhood or economic conditions where our offices are located could change in the future  potentially resulting in reduced revenues in those locations 
if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel 
our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers and key team members  particularly divisional senior vice presidents and regional vice presidents of operations 
competition for these employees is intense 
the loss of the services of members of our senior management or key team members or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business 
regular turnover among our managers and employees at our offices makes it more difficult for us to operate our offices and increases our costs of operations  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the annual turnover as of march  among our office employees was approximately 
this turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our offices 
if we are unable to keep our employee turnover rates consistent with historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the concentration of our revenues in certain states could adversely affect us 
our offices operated in states and mexico during the year ended march   and our largest states measured by total revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
while we believe we have a diverse geographic presence  for the near term we expect that significant revenues will continue to be generated by certain states  largely due to the currently prevailing economic  demographic  regulatory  competitive and other conditions in those states 
changes in these or any other conditions in the markets in which we operate could lead to a reduction in demand for loans  a decline in our revenues or an increase in our provision for loan losses  any of which could result in a deterioration of our results of operations or financial condition 
our ability to manage our growth may deteriorate  and our ability to execute our growth strategy may be adversely affected 
we have experienced substantial growth in recent years 
our growth strategy  which is based on rapidly opening and acquiring a large number of offices in existing and new markets  is subject to significant risks 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our market presence in our current markets or successfully enter new markets through the opening of new offices or acquisitions 
moreover  the start up costs and the losses from initial operations attributable to each newly opened office place demands upon our liquidity and cash flow  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy these demands 
in addition  our ability to execute our growth strategy will depend on a number of other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate  which are subject to change at any time  our ability to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals  government permits or licenses that may be required  the degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers  our ability to compete for expansion opportunities in suitable locations  our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  our ability to adapt our infrastructure and systems to accommodate our growth  and our ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
our growth has placed significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our administrative  technical and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
our future results of operations will substantially depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our business strategy profitably in geographic areas we do not currently serve 
interruption of  or a breach in security relating to  our information systems could adversely affect us 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
each office is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory  reconcile cash balances on a daily basis and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems  including any failure of our back up systems  could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  loan and other systems 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our centralized headquarters functions are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our headquarters building is located in greenville  south carolina 
our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our offices from this centralized location  and they could be disrupted if a catastrophic event  such as a tornado  power outage or act of terror  destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters 
any of these catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legislative or regulatory actions or changes with adverse results in litigation or regulatory proceedings or  failure to comply with existing laws and regulations could force us to cease  suspend or modify our operations in a state  potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to numerous laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans  lending forms and operations 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil  money or other penalties 
in addition  any adverse change in existing laws or regulations  or adverse interpretation or litigation relating to existing laws and regulations in any state in which we operate  could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or lower or eliminate the profitability of operations going forward by  among other things  reducing the amount of interest and fees we can charge in connection with our loans 
if these or other factors lead us to close our offices in a state  in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing  we would incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use 
if we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state  we may also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our offices and our employees in that state  with little or no revenues 
we depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our liquidity needs 
we have an existing revolving credit agreement committed through september that allows us to borrow up to million  assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions 
because we typically use substantially all of our available cash generated from our operations to repay borrowings on our revolving credit agreement on a current basis  we have limited cash balances and we expect that a significant portion of our liquidity needs will be funded primarily from borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
as of march   we had approximately million available for future borrowings under this agreement  excluding the seasonal line which expires each march due to the seasonal nature of our business  our borrowings are historically the highest during the third quarter and the lowest during the fourth quarter 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our financial needs  we may need to try to raise additional debt or equity in the future 
our revolving credit agreement contains restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business 
our revolving credit agreement contains a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our business 
these covenants impose limitations on the company with respect to declaring or paying dividends or making distributions on or acquiring common or preferred stock or warrants or options  redeeming or purchasing or prepaying principal or interest on subordinated debt incurring additional indebtedness  and entering into a merger  consolidation or sale of substantial assets or subsidiaries 
the breach of any covenants or obligation in our revolving credit agreement will result in a default 
if there is an event of default under our revolving credit agreement  the lenders under the revolving credit agreement could cause all amounts outstanding thereunder to become due and payable  subject to applicable grace periods 
this could trigger cross defaults under our other existing or future debt instruments 
as a result  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to secure additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might further our growth strategy 
if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement  the lenders under that agreement could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
our obligations under the revolving credit agreement are guaranteed by each of our existing and future subsidiaries 
the borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and the subsidiary guarantees are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors 
in addition  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock  or similar equity interests  of the subsidiary guarantors 
in the event of our insolvency  liquidation  dissolution or reorganization  the lenders under our revolving credit agreement and any other existing or future debt of ours would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions  if any  were made to our stockholders 
if our estimates of loan losses are not adequate to absorb losses  our provision for loan losses would increase 
this would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings  which also could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans we make directly to consumers 
to estimate the appropriate allowance for loan losses  we consider the amount of outstanding loan balances owed to us  historical delinquency and charge off trends  and other factors discussed in our consolidated financial statements 
as of march   our allowance for loan losses was million 
these amounts  however  are estimates 
if our actual loan losses are greater than our allowance for loan losses  our provision for loan losses would increase 
this would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings  which also could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
our business is seasonal in nature  which causes our revenues  collection rates and earnings to fluctuate 
these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price 
our business is seasonal because demand for small consumer loans is highest in the third quarter of each year  corresponding to the holiday seasons  and lowest in the fourth quarter of each year  corresponding to our customers receipt of income tax refunds 
our provision for loan losses is historically lowest as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of each year  corresponding to our customers receipt of income tax refunds  and increase as a percentage of revenues for the remainder of each year 
this seasonality requires us to manage our cash flows over the course of the year 
if our revenues or collections were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods  our ability to service our debt and meet our other liquidity requirements may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price 
in addition  our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future because of the seasonal nature of our business 
therefore  our quarterly revenues and results of operations are difficult to forecast  which  in turn could cause our future quarterly results to not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
our failure to meet such expectations could cause a material drop in the market price of our common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
since  we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and may not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of dividend paying companies 
various provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and south carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control that the holders of our common stock may favor or may impede the ability of our stockholders to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and south carolina law  among other things  authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval  and will require the affirmative vote of holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares of voting stock to approve our merger or consolidation with another corporation 
our continued expansion into mexico may increase the risks inherent in conducting international operations 
although our operations in mexico accounted for only of our revenues and of our gross loans receivable for the year ended march   we intend to continue opening offices and expanding our presence in mexico 
in doing so  we may expose an increasing portion of our business to risks inherent in conducting international operations  including currency fluctuations and devaluations  unsettled political conditions  communication and translation errors due to language barriers  compliance with differing legal and regulatory regimes and differing cultural attitudes toward regulation and compliance 
among the additional risks potentially affecting our mexican operations are changes in local economic conditions  disruption from political unrest and difficulty in enforcing agreements due to differences in the mexican legal and regulatory regimes compared to those of the us our success in conducting foreign operations will depend  in large part  on our ability to succeed in differing economic  social and political conditions 
among other things  we face potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  and we have to design local solutions to manage credit risks posed by local customers 
we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business

since march   gross loans receivable have increased at a annual compounded rate from million to million at march  the increase reflects both the higher volume of loans generated through the company s existing offices and the contribution of loans generated from new offices opened or acquired over the period

critical accounting policies the company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the finance company industry 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies involve significant judgment by the company s management  including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
as a result  changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and share based compensation  to be its most critical accounting policies due to the significant degree of management judgment involved 
allowance for loan losses the company has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that take into consideration various assumptions and estimates with respect to the loan portfolio 
the company s assumptions and estimates may be affected in the future by changes in economic conditions  among other factors 
for additional discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses  see credit quality below 
share based compensation the company measures compensation cost for share based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life  changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate 
in addition  the estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
the company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
credit quality the company s delinquency and net charge off ratios reflect  among other factors  changes in the mix of loans in the portfolio  the quality of receivables  the success of collection efforts  bankruptcy trends and general economic conditions 
delinquency is computed on the basis of the date of the last full contractual payment on a loan known as the recency method and on the basis of the amount past due in accordance with original payment terms of a loan known as the contractual method 
management closely monitors portfolio delinquency using both methods to measure the quality of the company s loan portfolio and the probability of credit losses 
the following table classifies the gross loans receivable of the company that were delinquent on a recency and contractual basis for at least days at march    and at march  dollars in thousands recency basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable contractual basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable loans are charged off at the earlier of when such loans are deemed to be uncollectible or when six months have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment 
the company s charge off policy has been consistently applied and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported 
management considers the charge off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
the company experienced an increase in contractual delinquency from at march  to at march  the delinquency rate on a recency basis also increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of the current fiscal year 
charge offs as a percent of average loans increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through renewals of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a renewal represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
for fiscal   and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were renewals of existing loans were  and  respectively 
the company s renewal policies  while limited by state regulations  in all cases consider our customer s payment history and require that our customer have made at least one payment on the loan being considered for renewal 
a renewal is considered a current renewal if the customer is no more than days delinquent on a contractual basis 
delinquent renewals may be extended to customers that are more than days past due on a contractual basis if the customer completes a new application and the manager believes that the customer s ability and intent to repay has improved 
it is the company s policy to not renew delinquent loans in amounts greater than the original amounts financed 
in all cases  a customer must complete a new application every two years 
during fiscal  delinquent renewals represented of the company s total loan volume compared to in fiscal charge offs  as a percentage of loans made by category  are greatest on loans made to new borrowers and less on loans made to former borrowers and renewals 
this is as expected due to the payment history experience available on repeat borrowers 
however  as a percentage of total loans charged off  renewals represent the greatest percentage due to the volume of loans made in this category 
the following table depicts the charge offs as a percent of loans made by category and as a percent of total charge offs during fiscal loan volume percent of percent of total by category total charge offs loans made by category renewals former borrowers new borrowers the company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount that  in management s opinion  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the company charges against current earnings  as a provision for loan losses  amounts added to the allowance to maintain it at levels expected to cover probable losses of principal 
when establishing the allowance for loan losses  the company takes into consideration the growth of the loan portfolio  the mix of the loan portfolio  current levels of charge offs  current levels of delinquencies  and current economic factors 
in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 the company accrues an estimated loss if it is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
it is probable that there are losses in the existing portfolio 
to estimate the losses  the company uses historical information for net charge offs and average loan life 
this method is based on the fact that many customers renew their loans prior to the contractual maturity 
average contractual loan terms are approximately nine months and the average loan life is approximately four months 
based on this method  the company had an allowance for loan losses that approximated six months of average net charge offs at march    and therefore  at each year end the company had an allowance for loan losses that covered estimated losses for its existing loans based on historical charge offs and average lives 
in addition  the entire loan portfolio turns over approximately times during a typical twelve month period 
therefore  a large percentage of loans that are charged off during any fiscal year are not on the company s books at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company believes that it is not appropriate to provide for losses on loans that have not been originated  that twelve months of net charge offs are not needed in the allowance  and that the method employed is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company records acquired loans at fair value based on current interest rates  less an allowance for uncollectibility and collection costs 
the company follows statement of position no 
sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  which prohibits carryover or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of the sop 
management believes that a loan has shown deterioration if it is over days delinquent 
the company believes that loans acquired have not shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  and therefore  are not within the scope of sop because there is no consideration paid for acquired loans over days delinquent 
for the years ended march   and  the company recorded adjustments of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to the allowance for loan losses in connection with acquisitions in accordance generally accepted accounting principles 
these adjustments represent the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans which are not within the scope of sop the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses in the existing portfolio at march  the following is a summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended march    and march  balance at the beginning of the year provision for loan losses loan losses recoveries allowance on acquired loans balance at the end of the year allowance as a percentage of loans receivable  net of unearned and deferred fees net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable average loans receivable have been determined by averaging month end gross loans receivable less unearned interest and deferred fees over the indicated period 
quarterly information and seasonality the company s loan volume and corresponding loans receivable follow seasonal trends 
the company s highest loan demand typically occurs from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand has generally been the lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
loan volume and average balances typically remain relatively level during the remainder of the year 
this seasonal trend affects quarterly operating performance through corresponding fluctuations in interest and fee income and insurance commissions earned and the provision for loan losses recorded  as well as fluctuations in the company s cash needs 
consequently  operating results for the company s third fiscal quarter generally are significantly lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are significantly higher than in other quarters

international revenues were less than of total revenues for the year ended march  and net loans denominated in mexican pesos were approximately million usd at march  the company s foreign currency exchange rate exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material effect on its financial results 
there have been  and there may continue to be  period to period fluctuations in the relative portions of mexican revenues

the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
while increases in operating costs would adversely affect the company s operations  the consumer lending laws of two of the eleven states in which the company operates allow indexing of maximum loan amounts to the consumer price index 
these provisions will allow the company to make larger loans at existing interest rates in those states  which could partially offset the potential increase in operating costs due to inflation
