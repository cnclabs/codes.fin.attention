goodwill accounts for approximately of our assets  or  we recorded an operating loss in of million compared to a operating loss of million in the million additional year over year loss was mainly a result of a decrease in revenue from a major customer 
revenue from otsuka research institute was of our total revenue in approximately million compared to of our total revenue in approximately million 
the million decrease was primarily a result of the successful early completion of several large trials 
the company continues to focus its efforts on marketing and selling its eclinical product to improve its operating performance 
in addition  throughout we made a series of cost reduction moves that will lower our cost structure by approximately million annually 
the company is continuing to enhance and commercialize its business and software  and anticipates that its operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of edc in general  as an alternative to the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  and acceptance of our software products specifically

approximately of the company s december  backlog is comprised of individual trial contracts and subject to being cancelled or delayed at anytime 
clickfind acquisition on february   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of clickfind  a company focused on the application of a unified technology platform for clinical trials  located in bryan  texas

the operating results of clickfind have been included in our consolidated results of operations for all periods subsequent to february  the cash portion of the purchase price  less cash acquired of  was approximately  the remainder of the purchase price consisted of  in notes payable and the issuance of approximately  in common shares  common shares  both of which are excluded from the company s consolidated statement of cash flows 
the notes payable bear interest at prime plus and as of march  have one remaining principal payment of  due february  in connection with the datasci claim  an arrangement was entered into with certain former clickfind shareholders for sharing of the expenses associated with that litigation

approximately of the company s december   backlog is individual contracts and subject to being cancelled or delayed at anytime 
the company s individual contract backlog  at any point in time  is not an accurate predictor of future levels of revenue 
as a result of datatrak s transactional and service based business model combined with the 
table of contents dynamic nature of the clinical trials market where changes in scope are common  backlog has historically not been an accurate predictor of short term revenue

the reduction in revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily the result of a significant decrease attributable to one client  otsuka research institute  which accounted for of our total revenue in compared to of total revenue in of the overall  decrease in revenue  the decrease in otsuka revenue accounted for approximately  of the reduction  or 
otsuka revenue decreased primarily as a result of the successful early completion of several large trials 
in otsuka accounted for of our total revenue 
we believe less than of our total revenue will come from otsuka 
to date  datatrak has been unable to generate sufficient new sales to offset the decline in revenue from the otsuka projects 
we continue our efforts to enhance our sales and marketing organization and have experienced significant turnover in our sales team 
five of the company s current nine person sales and marketing staff have been with datatrak a year or less 
the company replaced its vice president of marketing and sales in june of and added a director of marketing in the third quarter of to aggressively pursue sales growth in future periods 
we have previously disclosed that we have experienced significant trial delays from certain clients during the third quarter of approximately of our june  backlog produced no revenue during the three months ended september  compared to of our june  backlog not producing revenue in the third quarter of these delays are a result of internal decisions on the part of the client as to when to begin certain trials 
approximately of our september  backlog produced no revenue during the three months ended december  compared to of our september  backlog not producing revenue in the fourth quarter of subsequent to december   one client with two of the nine delayed trials canceled both trials 
as a result of these cancellations we reduced our backlog in early by approximately  we will be required to refund approximately  of unearned start up fees in related to these cancellations 

table of contents direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net decrease of  or  was mainly a result of lower software license costs 
datatrak s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue 
the net decrease was partially offset by a  increase in overall direct cost as a result of the higher exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro

during the year ended december   datatrak recorded a charge of  for severance benefits due to terminated employees 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of  of additional amortization expense related to a change in estimate for one of our intangible assets and a  impairment charge for another intangible asset 
the  of additional amortization was related to the shift in timing of actual revenue recognition  as compared to our original estimate at the time of the clickfind acquisition  from our contract and customer relationship intangible asset 
the impairment charge of  was against the non compete agreements related to the clickfind acquisition 
as a result of consecutive quarterly operating losses since the first quarter of and forecasted continuing operating losses based on current sales trends  the company determined that impairment indicators existed as of june   september  and also as of december  the company conducted impairment testing of its goodwill and finite lived tangible and intangible assets as of all three dates

to date  we have not established a trend of multi year large dollar subscriptions license agreements similar to the million deal with ntt data corporation 
the million receipt is included in our december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments total of million 
contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received monthly as work on the contract progresses 
we record all amounts received as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts and our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
our contracting and collection practices are designed to encourage customer payment of accounts receivable balances between one to three months from invoice date 
any increase in our days sales outstanding is an indicator that our cash flow from operations and our working capital has been negatively impacted 
at december   our days sales outstanding was days which was consistent with days calculated at december  accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  short term deferred revenue was  at december  compared to  at december  long term deferred revenue was  at december  compared to zero as of december  the significant increase in overall deferred revenue was due primarily to the  advance payment received in december upon the signing of a five year enterprise subscription license agreement with ntt data corporation

as of december    was available to be borrowed 
the line of credit bears interest at rates based on the prime rate  and is payable on demand 
we had no amounts outstanding against the line of credit at december  at december   we had a note payable of  due to westfield bank 
the final payment on this note of  including accrued interest  was made in january at december   we had a note payable in the amount of  to oracle credit corporation  payable in monthly payments of  including accrued interest through june additionally  at december   we had various capital lease agreements in the amount of  with dell financial services  payable in monthly installments currently totaling approximately  including accrued interest 
the terms of our acquisition of clickfind required us to pay approximately  of cash to the former shareholders of clickfind in february we also issued notes payable to the former shareholders of clickfind the clickfind notes in the amount of  the notes payable had an outstanding balance of  as of december  in february  we paid the next installment totaling  bringing the current outstanding balance to  which is due and payable february

of the remaining  of clickfind notes   is held by other current employees of the company 
the company is continuing our efforts to renegotiate the payment terms for the remaining clickfind notes 
if the company is not successful in renegotiating the payment terms with the note holders  datatrak believes that it will not have available funds to meet the  obligation on february  in connection with the datasci claim  an arrangement was entered into with certain former clickfind shareholders for sharing of the expenses associated with that litigation 
under that arrangement  a certain portion of principal payments due under the notes would be used to offset a certain portion of the expenses related to the litigation 
of the  payment due on february    was held by the company to satisfy these expenses 
of the  payment due on february    was held by the company to satisfy such expenses 
in july  datatrak settled its litigation related to datasci s patent infringement claim with no liability against the company 
a total of  of the clickfind notes were used to offset expenses associated with the litigation 
we intend to continue to fund the maintenance and testing of the datatrak edc software  as well as invest in the development  enhancement and testing of datatrak eclinical tm 
in  revenue from one major customer had significantly decreased from the prior year 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations during as we continue transition from dependence on a major customer to a broader customer base with the expansion of our eclinical product offering 
we also expect to record a net loss in we anticipate expenditures for property and equipment of approximately  for  for the continued commercialization  enhancement and maintenance of our two clinical trial product offerings as well as improvements to our internal operating systems 
we anticipate financing approximately half of the  total property and equipment expenditures 
we record our research and development expenditures as part of sg a expenses 
our research and development expenditures will be for the maintenance and testing of our datatrak edc software and the development  enhancement and testing of our datatrak eclinical tm software products 
for the year ended december   we expensed approximately  for research and development 
if existing sales trends from the past six months september february continue for the rest of  and we experience no significant unforeseen trial cancellations or delays  we believe we will have available funds in order to meet our short term working capital requirements through december  even if existing sales trends from the past six months continue for the rest of  and we experience no significant unforeseen trial cancellations or delays  we do not believe we will have sufficient available funds in order to meet our longer term working capital requirements for  including the  balloon payment on the clickfind notes due february  at december   we had working capital of  in an effort to partially address these working capital needs  we made significant cost reductions during the fourth quarter of which we expect will yield an annual cost savings of approximately million 
on an ongoing basis in  we will implement additional cost cutting measures if revenue and sales trend performance falls below our minimum 
table of contents expectations and we are unable to obtain additional funding 
in addition to the fourth quarter cost savings moves  we are continuing our efforts to restructure the clickfind notes 
any increase in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  as compared to the average rate  will have an adverse impact on our available cash 
we may also need to raise additional funds to offset delays or cancellations of existing contracts 
we may raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through short term investments and have business transactions in euros 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk datatrak has fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  and short and long term notes payable which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and has established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and 
table of contents liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a percentage point change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in datatrak s interest income during the year 
the company s notes payable to certain former shareholders of clickfind bear interest at prime plus  and interest is paid quarterly 
a percentage point change in the prime rate during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in datatrak s interest expense during the year 
foreign currency risk datatrak s foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company manages its risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
datatrak does not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
datatrak s financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro at december   would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on the company s balance sheet 
a fluctuation in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro for the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in the company s net loss for the year ended december  due to foreign currency transactions 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar increased by approximately compared to the year ended december  the conversion of the company s foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in a net loss that was approximately  more than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained consistent with rates
