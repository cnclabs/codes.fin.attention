with operations in approximately locations across six continents  we design  manufacture and service a comprehensive line of drilling and well servicing equipment  sell and rent drilling motors  specialized downhole tools  and rig instrumentation  perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products  provide drill cuttings separation  management and disposal systems and services  provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment  and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network 
we also manufacture coiled tubing  provide in service pipeline inspections  manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing  and sell and rent advanced in line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods 
we have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost effectiveness  efficiency  safety  and environmental impact of oil and gas operations 
our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile 
see risk factors 
we conduct our operations through three business segments rig technology  petroleum services supplies and distribution services 
see item business for a discussion of each of these business segments 
operating environment overview our results are dependent on  among other things  the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling  well remediation activity  the price of crude oil and natural gas  capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  pipeline maintenance activity  and the worldwide oil and gas inventory levels

natural gas prices increased slightly in in comparison to  and oil prices generally increased throughout the average price per barrel of west texas intermediate crude reached historic heights in  peaking at just over in november 
the average price for the year was the highest ever annual average oil price at per barrel  an increase of over the average price for natural gas prices were per mmbtu  an increase of compared to the average 
higher oil prices led to stronger rig activity worldwide  increasing for the full year in compared to at february   there were  rigs actively drilling in the us  compared to  rigs at december  the company believes that most current industry projections are forecasting commodity prices to remain strong  and  as a result  us and international drilling rig activity is expected to continue at a high level 
however  numerous events could significantly alter these projections including political tensions in the middle east  the acceleration or deceleration of the recovery of the us and world economies  a build up in the world inventory levels  or numerous other events or circumstances 

table of contents executive summary national oilwell varco generated earnings of  million or per fully diluted share in its fiscal year ended december   on revenues of  million 
earnings per share increased percent and revenue increased percent from the company s earnings and revenues  respectively  as we experienced rising demand for our products and services through the year 
our backlog for capital equipment increased percent throughout the year  despite steadily rising shipments out of backlog  due principally to growing numbers of new offshore drilling rig construction projects initiated during which placed orders with the company 
oil gas equipment and services market oil and gas prices have increased significantly over the past five years and remain near historic highs  which have led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe 
the count of rigs actively drilling during as measured by baker hughes a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending increased percent from  representing the fifth straight year of increasing average annual rig count 
year to year growth in domestic  latin american and eastern hemisphere drilling activity was partly offset by canadian activity declines 
activity in the us and the eastern hemisphere grew modestly throughout the year  while canada declined sharply during the second quarter  as it typically does  and remained weak throughout the second half of latin american drilling activity was essentially flat throughout the year 
the level of drilling activity underway is the highest seen since the early s  which is fueling high demand for oilfield services 
much of the new incremental drilling activity is occurring in harsh environments  and employs increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves 
higher utilization of drilling rigs has tested the capability of the world s fleet of rigs  much of which is old and of limited capability 
technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built 
the industry invested little during the late s and s on new drilling equipment  but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless  as the company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling 
as a consequence  the safety  reliability  and efficiency of new  modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today 
the rise in demand for drilling rigs has driven rig dayrates higher over the past few years  which has increased cash flows and available financing to drilling contractors 
many have invested in new rigs or placed older rigs back into service 
the company has played an important role in providing both new rigs as well as the equipment  consumables and services needed to reactivate many older rigs 
oil and gas producers demand top performance from drilling rigs  particularly at the premium dayrates that are being paid today 
as a result of this trend  the company has benefited from incremental demand for new products such as our small iron roughnecks for land rigs  our lxt bop s  our safe t lite pump liner systems  among others to upgrade certain rig functions to make them safer and more efficient 
drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells  more complex wells  highly deviated wells and horizontal wells  tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities 
higher dayrates magnify the opportunity cost of rig downtime  and rigs are being pushed to maximize revenue days for their drilling contractor owners 
the drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig  which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement 
this process has been accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity 
drilling consumes rigs  more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster 
changing methods of drilling have further benefited the company s business 
increasingly  hydraulic power in addition to conventional mechanical rotary power is being used to apply torque to the drill bit 
this is done using downhole drilling motors powered by drilling fluids 
we are a major provider of downhole drilling motors  and we have seen demand for this application of our drilling motors increase over the last few years 
this trend has also increased demand for our high pressure mud pumps  which create the hydraulic power in the drilling fluid which drive the drilling motors 
while the increasingly efficient equipment provided by us has mitigated the effect  high activity levels have increased demand for personnel in the oilfield 
consequently  the company  its customers and its suppliers have experienced wage inflation in certain markets 
hiring experienced drilling crews has been challenging for the drilling industry  however  we believe crews generally prefer working on newer  more modern rigs 
our products which save labor and increase efficiency such as its automatic slips and pipe handling equipment also make the rig crew s jobs safer and easier  and make the rig a more desirable place to work 
the world is actively building nearly new offshore rigs  and schedules call for new drillships  new semisubmersibles  and new jackup rigs to be delivered into the fleet by the end of the offshore rig fleet they will join is old  the average age is approximately years 
the existing fleet was engineered and constructed prior to many technical advancements  
table of contents and we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency  safety  and capability  and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet 
additionally  the large number of floating rig construction projects will add new capacity required to press exploration into new deepwater frontiers 
land rig construction is strong  and new orders brisk  with most interest directed towards international markets where customers are adopting newer rig technologies 
our domestic land rig backlog has fallen by about half from peak levels due to lower dayrates in the us as compared to early  however  newer  better rigs are consistently posting meaningfully higher dayrates and utilization than older rigs in the domestic market 
we believe the retooling of the us land rig market will continue as favorable operator experience with higher technology rigs will continue to pull more of these into the marketplace 
overall we expect to continue to sell into three important trends in the rig fleet worldwide the secular buildout of additional deepwater capabilities  the retooling of the jackup fleet with newer  more capable rigs  and the replacement of older land rigs with improved technology 
segment performance revenues for the rig technology group in were  million  up percent from group revenues of  million 
operating profit was  million or percent of revenue in  compared to million or percent of sales in operating profit flow through or leverage the period to period increase in operating profit divided by the increase in revenue was percent from to the results benefited from higher new rig construction volumes  higher sales of aftermarket goods and services  rising manufacturing efficiencies and improving pricing  partly offset by higher employee and material costs 
the company s rig technology group reported a backlog of capital equipment orders totaling  million at december   up percent from december  the group was awarded  million in new capital equipment orders in  an increase of percent over orders won in fourth quarter orders of  million were the largest quarterly order level ever achieved by the group  and year ending backlog achieved record levels as well 
the company has the capability to supply up to million of equipment for a jackup rig  more than million of equipment for a new floating rig  and effectively all of a new land rig which can range in price from less than million for a well service rig to over million for a large harsh environment rig 
backlog for drilling equipment at december  was approximately percent offshore and percent land rig equipment 
the delivery of this equipment is typically tied to the construction schedule of the rig  which can take as long as four years to complete 
while substantially all of the current backlog will be delivered by the end of  a portion extends out as far as approximately percent of the drilling equipment in backlog is destined for international markets 
the company s rig technology group manufacturing base relies on a combination of internal and external capabilities  and we have significantly increased the output of our manufacturing plants in response to the high demand 
this has been accomplished by optimizing the manufacturing infrastructure between varco and national oilwell to enhance efficiency following the march merger  the rollout of quick response manufacturing qrm and lean manufacturing techniques across a number of facilities  and a percent increase in capital expenditures in the group as compared to we are also providing our vendors with longer range forecasts to assist their planning  placing longer term orders to match our backlog  and qualifying new suppliers throughout north america  europe and asia 
the company s petroleum services supplies generated  million in revenue in  an increase of percent from revenues of  million  due to rising demand for oilfield goods and services the group provides  the impact of acquisitions  and several international expansion initiatives launched by the group including new facilities opened in the middle east and far east 
additionally the group benefited from investments made in its coiled tubing and composite pipe manufacturing infrastructure last year 
the group s operating profit for the year was million or percent of sales  an increase from operating profit of million or percent of sales 
the group generated percent operating profit flow through from to margins for the petroleum services supplies group improved in as a result of the higher volumes and better pricing  offset by higher personnel and materials costs 
the strong results were broad based  with all major product and service lines up year over year 
domestic and international revenues continued to grow throughout the year  however  results in canada softened on a seasonally adjusted basis as many of our customers in canada reduced activity in response to lower gas prices  a stronger canadian dollar  and higher royalty expenses in alberta 
the group s mix of non north american revenue rose steadily throughout the year  from percent in the first quarter to percent in the fourth quarter  as overseas business grew 
the flattening of the rig count in the us  and the declining level of activity in canada compared to the prior year  reduced overall pricing leverage in north america  however  pricing trends remain very regional and product line specific  with pricing of certain products continuing to increase 

table of contents the company s distribution services group generated revenues of  million in  a four percent increase from revenues of  million 
operating profit was million  unchanged from the prior year 
operating margins were percent  down slightly from operating margins of percent 
the group generated no incremental operating profit flow through in  due mostly to a sharp decline in business in its canadian operations 
revenue growth in overseas markets fully offset lower canadian sales  but startup costs in several new international locations led to lower flow throughs from these areas 
domestic operations posted good year over year growth at strong flow throughs  but the business began to experience increasing domestic price pressure through the second half of strategic alliance agreements with new customers fueled much of the distribution services group s international growth 
once in place the strategic alliances provide the group a stable platform of business around which it can open new locations at lower risk and cost 
the group has expanded around the world by following our customers rigs into new regions 
the group is also selling more mro supplies internally to legacy varco organizations  which increased our leverage through greater purchase volumes 
outlook we believe that the outlook for the company for remains positive  as historically high commodity prices are expected to keep overall oil and gas activity high  and as the company enters with a record level of backlog for capital equipment for its rig technology group 
oil prices and supply remain subject to significant political risk in many international regions 
the growth of china and other emerging economies has added significant demand to the oil markets  and new sources of supply continue to prove challenging to find and produce economically 
the company expects the high oil prices that have resulted to sustain high levels of oilfield activity in  provided the world s major economies remain strong  and opec discipline keeps oil prices high 
high commodity prices  drilling activity levels  and drilling rig dayrates are expected to continue to fuel demand for the company s rig technology group 
the supply of offshore rigs remains tight in many markets  and quotation activity for the rig technology group remains brisk 
in particular  the company expects recent deepwater lease awards and announcements of discoveries in brazil to continue to fuel a high level of interest in floating drilling rig construction projects 
additionally  interest in new international land rigs remains very high  while domestic rig demand has stabilized 
our outlook for the company s petroleum services supplies segment remains good  given continuation of high levels of drilling across the us  middle east  north africa  the far east  latin america and the north sea 
while canadian activity remains slow  we believe the long term outlook there is good given the difficulties the industry has faced in meaningfully growing gas production across north america 
gas production from resource plays coal bed methane  tight sands and shales has increased to about percent of total us gas production  and is believed to exhibit higher decline rates than conventional reservoirs 
the company s distribution services segment operates in very competitive markets  but we are targeting further international expansion underpinned by new strategic alliances in to fuel additional growth 
the business also continues to be challenged by weak demand in canada

operating profit dollar increases ranging from to were achieved from downhole tool sales and rentals  drill pipe coating services and pipeline inspections 
distribution services revenue from distribution services totaled  million  an increase of million from the prior period 
the number of drilling rigs actively searching for oil and gas is a key metric for this business segment 
worldwide rig count increased in compared to  with increases of and in the us and international rig activity  offset almost entirely by a decline in canada rig activity 
the company s distribution services segment efforts to expand in international markets along with the increasing international market activity resulted in a increase in international revenue 
the international revenue growth over the prior period reflects additional large contract awards  the extension of us based contracts into the international arena  increased volume from our global alliance customers and increased export activity 
operating income remained the same in at million while margins decreased slightly to of revenue in compared to of revenue in the decrease in margin was primarily due to weak demand in canada and resulting lower operating profit in canada 
unallocated expenses and eliminations unallocated expenses and eliminations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase in operations costs was primarily due to greater inter segment profit eliminations  an increase in employee compensation expense and greater stock based compensation expense 
the stock based compensation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results also included million of integration costs related to the merger with varco 
interest and financial costs interest and financial costs were million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to unfavorable interest rate movements on the company s outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was an expense of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in expense was primarily due to a net foreign exchange loss which was million for the year ended december   as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december  the foreign exchange losses were primarily due to the strengthening in norwegian kroner  british pound sterling  and euro currencies compared to the us dollar 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the lower tax rate was due primarily to a higher percentage of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates  favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions associated with prior years and increased tax benefits in the us from manufacturing activities 
these benefits were partially offset by increased state income tax in the us from the new texas margins tax  incremental us tax on repatriated foreign earnings and the loss of tax benefits in the us associated with export sales in that was fully terminated for the us laws granting this export tax benefit were modified as part of the american jobs creation act of and this benefit is no longer available 
a new tax benefit associated with us manufacturing operations passed into law under the same act will be phased in over a five year period beginning in whereas the timing of the phase out of the export tax benefit and the phase in of the manufacturing tax benefit may differ  we expect the tax reduction associated with the new manufacturing deduction  when fully implemented  to be similar in amount to the export benefit 
we anticipate our tax rate for to be in the range of approximately to for continuing operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  million  and total debt of million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were million and total debt was million 
the increase in cash holdings was primarily a result of increased operating activities and securing project orders that require large down payments and early payment terms 
the company s outstanding debt at december  consisted of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  and other debt of million 
cash provided by operating activities in was  million compared to cash provided by operating activities of  million in cash was used by operations primarily through increases in inventories of million  receivables of million  cost in excess of billings of million and prepaid and other current assets of million 
these negative cash flows were offset by net income of  million  billings in excess of costs of million and non cash charges of million 
receivables increased due to greater revenue  pricing and activity in compared to  while inventory increased due to continued higher costs  activity  growing backlog orders  and customer prepayments 
billings in excess of costs increased due to early payment terms in relation to construction projects 
for the year ended december   cash used by investing activities was million compared to million used for we used million to complete eight acquisitions during and the final payment for nql energy services  inc capital spending of million was primarily related to rental assets associated with the company s petroleum services supplies operations and capital expansion related to increased capacity for manufacturing operations 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million in cash was provided by financing activities through proceeds from stock options exercised of million  excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million and net borrowings of million 
we believe cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations 
we also believe increases in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through debt financing 
in addition  the company is negotiating to replace the existing million unsecured credit facility with billion of unsecured credit facilities 
we expect the facilities to consist of a billion five year revolving credit facility  and a billion  day revolving credit facility 
a portion of the proceeds will be used to finance the grant prideco transaction  with the credit facility closing concurrent with the grant prideco transaction closing 
a summary of the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in millions payment due by period less than after total year years years years total debt operating leases total contractual obligations standby letters of credit as of december   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note  income tax  to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
the company expects to increase its capital spending approximately in to exceed million 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions and capital spending primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us 

table of contents inflation has had an impact on certain of our operations in recent years 
we believe that the higher costs for energy  steel and other commodities experienced in have largely been mitigated by increased prices and component surcharges for the products we sell 
however  higher steel  labor  energy or other commodity prices may adversely impact future periods 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairments of long lived assets excluding goodwill  goodwill impairment and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue recognition under long term construction contracts the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the rig technology group 
these long term construction contracts include the following characteristics the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications  the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts  and construction projects often have progress payments 
this method requires the company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project  progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date  all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the company recognizes in each reporting period 
the company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project  taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin 
significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access  weather  production efficiencies  availability and costs of labor  materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in risk factors 
these factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the company s estimates and materially impact the company s future reported earnings 
historically  the company s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts  excluding million of losses recorded in resulting from changes in cost estimates relating to two rigs delivered to kazakhstan as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
excluding these losses  and based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at december  and  adjustments representing the differences between the estimated and actual results to all outstanding contracts resulted in changes to gross profit margins of million on billion of outstanding contracts and million on billion of outstanding contracts  respectively 
while the company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at december  and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting  the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods 
the company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts on a contract to date basis of billion at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from customer accounts requires the company to make judgments regarding future events and trends 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the company s portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis 
this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience  current aging status of the customer accounts  and financial condition of the company s customers 
based on a review of these factors  the company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable portfolio as a whole 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international shipyards  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  the creditworthiness of the company s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
at december  and  allowance for bad debts totaled million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 

table of contents historically  the company s charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the risk factors mentioned above  changes in our estimates could become material in future periods 
inventory reserves inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand  assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and estimates about potential alternative uses  which are usually limited 
the company s inventory consists of specialized spare parts  work in process  and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the company s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield 
customers rely on the company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner 
the company s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity  which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled and of gross inventory  respectively 
recent high demand and a strong outlook for oilfield equipment sales provide the basis for the company s december  and estimates regarding the future usage and realizable value of inventory 
while inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the company s financial results for the periods covered in this report  changes in worldwide oil and gas activity  or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete  could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory 
such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
the forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the intended use of these assets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
there have been no impairment charges of long lived assets for the years ended december   and goodwill impairment the company has approximately billion of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment of goodwill could include but are not limited to a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling  a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors  a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity  a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies  or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas 
the timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge  which could be material  would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment 
the company performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the annual impairment tests are performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
if it is determined that goodwill is impaired  that impairment is measured based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill and identified intangibles is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company encounters events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the carrying amount of goodwill and identified intangibles has been impaired 
fair value of the reporting units is determined based on 
table of contents internal management estimates  using a combination of three methods discounted cash flow  comparable companies  and representative transactions 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  the company also tests for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company had no impairment of goodwill for the years ended december   and income taxes the company is a us registered company and is subject to income taxes in the us the company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the company operates and income is earned 
the company s annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year 
the company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation  which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries 
the company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
the annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the company considers appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain tax credits which may not ultimately be sustained 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means 
the company is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments 
the company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is an interpretation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year  the effect will be recognized in the period of the event 
the company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
other than valuation allowances associated with tax attributes acquired through acquisitions  income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the company s valuation allowances 
the realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income 
any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
if a change in a valuation allowance occurs  which was established in connection with an acquisition  such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  the company may be required to record additional taxes 
unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company makes an annual determination whether to permanently reinvest these earnings 
if  as a result of these reassessments  the company distributes these earnings in the future  additional tax liability would result  offset by any available foreign tax credits 
the company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information concerning each of these matters follows foreign currency exchange rates we have extensive operations in foreign countries 
the net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency 
these operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency  which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that do impact income 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
the gains losses were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the foreign exchange loss is primarily the result in the strengthening of the following major currencies against the us dollar british pound  canadian dollar  euro and the norwegian kroner 
further strengthening of these currencies against the us dollar may continue to create similar losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the above currencies as their functional currency 
certain revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
similarly  some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  but have associated us dollar costs  which also gives rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
in order to mitigate that risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating  million to hedge cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies 
these exposures arise when local currency operating expenses are not in balance with local currency revenue collections 
based on quoted market prices as of december  and for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  we have recorded a gain of million and million  respectively  to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value 
this gain is included in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
it is expected that million of the gain will be reclassified into earnings within the next months 
at december   the company has cash flow hedges in place through the first quarter of a gain from ineffectiveness of million is included in earnings related to these foreign currency contracts as of december  ineffectiveness for and was not material 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating  million designated and qualifying as fair value hedges to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies 
based on quoted market prices as of december  and for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  we recorded a gain of million and million  respectively  to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value 
this gain is offset by designated losses on the firm commitments 
a loss from ineffectiveness of million is included in earnings related to these foreign currency contracts as of december  ineffectiveness for and was not material 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating million to offset exposures to the currency fluctuation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet accounts  primarily consisting of account receivables and account payables  and are not designated as hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded each period in current earnings 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating  million designated and qualifying as net investment hedges of our norwegian operations 
based on market prices as of december  for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  we have recorded a gain of million  net of tax of million to adjust these foreign contracts to their fair market value 
this gain is included in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the maturity of the above forward contracts by currency is in millions hedge classification currency total cash flow dkk eur gbp sek sgd usd fair value eur gbp krw sgd usd   balance sheet eur gbp sdg usd net investment cad nok total the company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies totaling million as of december  excluding trade receivables and payables  which approximate fair value 
these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by million 
the counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
we assess the functional currencies of our operating units to ensure that the appropriate currencies are utilized in accordance with the guidance of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
effective january   we changed the functional currency of our rig technology unit in norway from the norwegian kroner to the us dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which they operate 
this change was precipitated by significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances  including the increased order rate for large drilling platforms and components technology  the use of our norway unit as our preferred project manager of these projects  increasing revenue and cost base in us dollars  and the implementation of an international cash pool 
as a norwegian kroner functional unit  norway was subject to increasing foreign currency exchange risk as a result of these changes in its economic environment and was dependent upon significant hedging transactions to offset its non functional currency positions 
at december   our norway operations had derivatives with  million in notional value with a fair value of million as compared to  million and million at december   respectively  to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk against the us dollar  our reporting currency 
effective with the change in the functional currency  the company terminated these hedges 
the related net position of million associated with the terminated hedges will be recognized into earnings in the future periods the forecasted transactions affect earnings 
the company has subsequent to january   entered into new hedges to cover the exposures as a result of the changes to us dollar functional 

table of contents interest rate risk at december   our long term borrowings consisted of million in senior notes  million in senior notes  million in senior notes  million in senior notes and million in senior notes 
we had million of other borrowings at december  we occasionally have borrowings under our other credit facilities  and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either libor  nibor or euribor  or at the prime interest rate 
under our credit facilities  we may  at our option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor  nibor or euribor for days to months 
our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million associated with our senior notes 
under this agreement  we receive interest at a fixed rate of and pay interest at a floating rate of six month libor plus a weighted average spread of approximately 
the swap agreements will settle semi annually and will terminate in february the swap agreements originally entered into by varco were recorded at their fair market value at the date of the merger and no longer qualify as effective hedges under fas the swaps have been marked to market for periods subsequent to the merger and any change in their value has been reported as an adjustment to interest expense 
the change in the fair market value of the interest swap agreements resulted in a million decrease in interest expense for the period ended december
