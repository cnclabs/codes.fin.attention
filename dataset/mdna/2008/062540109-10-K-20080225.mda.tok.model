critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions or judgments to be made based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates 
those policies have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than reported if there is a change to any of the estimates  assumptions  or judgments made by us 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions  and judgments used  we identified the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of leased asset residual values  the valuation of pension and postretirement benefit obligations  and the determination of income tax expense and liability to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective or judgmental 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur losses 
the amount of such losses will vary  depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  including rising interest rates  and the financial performance of borrowers 
the reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the reserve for credit losses provides for credit losses inherent in lending or committing to lend and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
on a quarterly basis  an evaluation of specific individual commercial borrowers is performed to identify impaired loans and leases 
also  on a quarterly basis  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the reserve for credit losses prior to final affirmation by the board of directors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the reserve for credit losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights when mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
an estimated fair value is used because there is no quoted or established market for valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service  and interest rates that reflect the risk involved 
our estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions 
had we assumed lower long term interest rates and higher loan repayment rates  the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower than recorded in our consolidated statements of condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on mortgage servicing rights 
valuation of leased asset residual values lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
our determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until lease termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
we update our valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
when we determine that the fair value is lower than the expected residual value at lease expiration  the difference is recognized as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis is completed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the residual value of leased assets 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on the following key assumptions discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and return on plan assets 
changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate used to value the future benefit obligation as of each year end is the rate used to determine the periodic benefit cost in the following year 
the estimated pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost for is million  based on an assumed discount rate of 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis of a basis point change in discount rates to the net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligation discount rate sensitivity analysis table impact of dollars in thousands discount rate basis point increase discount rate basis point decrease net periodic benefit cost  pension benefits net periodic benefit cost  postretirement benefits pension benefit obligation as of december    postretirement benefit obligation as of december  estimated net periodic benefit cost  pension benefits estimated net periodic benefit cost  postretirement benefits see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
currently  we file tax returns in nine federal  state and local domestic jurisdictions  and four foreign jurisdictions 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  affect accrued income taxes and can be significant to our operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes

our main operating subsidiary  the bank  was organized on december  and is chartered by the state of hawaii 
our vision exceptional people building exceptional value for our customers  our island communities  our shareholders  and each other 
our governing objective maximize shareholder value over time 
in striving to fulfill our vision and governing objective  in january we introduced our plan plan to our shareholders  customers  and employees 
our plan consists of five strategic themes growth integration people brand discipline growth our strategy for growth is to focus on the hawaii market 
specific initiatives include introducing new products  services and delivery processes  enhanced services  and our improved sales culture 
we implemented customer retention initiatives  and built our deposit and loan strategies on integration and brand strengths 
a stronger brand identity and full integration will help achieve success beyond that which is possible by independent business units 
near term growth opportunities are seen to be particularly attractive within the area of investment services 
in addition  shareholder value will be further enhanced through growth in our core deposit base 
integration in order to continue our integration of products and services  we strive to find a proper balance between incentive initiatives that reward success at the company level as well as the business unit levels but always approaching the customer as one bank 
integration will involve products and services  financial expertise  and delivery channels that will make organizational boundaries transparent to customers 
our integration strategy involves identifying inter segment operating efficiencies and developing new customer centric products designed for easy use and efficiency  replicating high growth products  services and processes across the company and evolving a simpler structure to meet customers needs and maximize the benefits of integration 
specifically  we intend to measure cross sell success while reducing redundant products and services that exist in multiple business units 
people hiring  developing  retaining  and rewarding talented people is important to fulfilling our vision 
areas of focus for the coming years will include leadership excellence  talent acquisition  enhancing our positive work environment  and recognizing and rewarding talent 
our strategy involves ongoing efforts to strengthen leadership excellence 
pathways to leadership excellence is the primary developmental program to build leadership talent for the future 
an incentive system designed to encourage cooperation and integration among our business units helps to align goals with successful customer outcomes 
brand a special emphasis is placed on the element of brand since our brand serves to differentiate us from our competitors 
consistently living up to our brand promise is essential for attracting clients  building relationships  and growing our business 
our brand promise states at bank of hawaii  we understand who you are and help you achieve what you aspire to be 
this promise to our customers is supported by key principles safety and soundness  service  personal relationships  community  and stature 
our ability to deliver on our brand promise directly impacts customer satisfaction  depth of relationship  and retention

personal relationships  community  and stature are what we consider business winning attributes that can distinguish us in the marketplace 
managing the brand is a continuous long term business practice  not a short term tactic 
we believe our brand can lead to our customers trust  loyalty  and advocacy as well as enhance shareholder value 
discipline discipline entails not only a balanced approach to managing risk and comparing actual performance to forecasts  but also emphasizing our performance to deliver stable long term results to our shareholders 
meeting the financial goals of our plan will require balanced management with growth in the near term coming from in market initiatives 
discipline is integral to maintaining our earnings stream and asset quality 
discipline creates a low risk profile and results in low earnings volatility while maintaining our prudent investment perception 
we believe discipline entails emphasizing company performance over individual business unit results and aligning individual incentives with company goals 
it also entails avoiding short term initiatives with tangible gains if they involve risks that sacrifice long term growth or expose us to unnecessary risk 
activities include providing sufficient resources in the areas of finance  risk  compliance  legal  and governance and making these resources available to business unit managers 
we are continuing to develop and strengthen our compliance culture as well as develop new reporting methods designed to assess business unit performance quickly and effectively

net interest income we earn net interest income when interest income on earning assets  primarily loans  leases  and investment securities  exceeds interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and other funding sources 
the amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in interest rates rate and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities volume 
net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  decreased by million or in from  primarily due to increased funding costs 
rates paid on savings and time deposit accounts increased in  reflecting the full effects of a rising interest rate environment during the increase in our funding costs in was also affected by an increase in average time deposit balances as some customers shifted their balances from noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand accounts into higher yielding time deposit accounts 
partially offsetting the increase in funding costs was an increase in yields on investment securities and loans and leases  as well as higher average loan balances in substantially all categories 
net interest margin decreased by basis points in from  primarily due to the prolonged effects of the inverted or flat yield curve 
average loans and leases increased by million or in from  with growth in substantially all loan categories

average interest bearing liabilities increased by million or in from  primarily due to growth in time deposits 
average time deposit balances increased by million as customers sought higher rate deposit products 
also contributing to the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was a million increase in average balances in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these financial instruments provide us with a relatively inexpensive and readily available source of short term financing 
average long term debt  the costliest of our interest bearing liabilities  remained relatively unchanged in from net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  decreased by million or in from  primarily due to increased funding costs 
rates paid on demand and savings accounts increased  as some customers shifted deposits from demand and savings accounts into higher rate time deposits and into off balance sheet managed cash accounts 
also contributing to the higher funding costs were increased levels of securities sold under agreements to repurchase which served as one source of funding the growth in loans and leases in partially offsetting the increase in the funding costs was an increase in yields on loans and investment securities and an increase in average loans and leases 
net interest margin decreased by basis points in from  primarily due to the impact that the flat or inverted yield curve had on the mix of our funding sources and related rates paid during average loans and leases increased by million or in from  and yields on total loans and leases increased by basis points in from average balances in investment securities remained relatively unchanged during this period  however  yields increased by basis points in the available for sale portfolio and by basis points in held to maturity portfolio  reflecting a general rise in interest rates 
growth in average loans and leases required the utilization of deposits and short term borrowings as a funding mechanism 
average interest bearing liabilities increased by million or in from  primarily due to an increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  time deposits  and short term borrowings 
although average deposits remained relatively unchanged during this period  there was significant movement in balances within deposit products 
average noninterest bearing demand  interest bearing demand  and savings balances collectively decreased by million or in from over this same period  average time deposits increased by million or as customers sought higher rate deposit products and customers also used their off balance sheet managed cash accounts as a means of obtaining higher rates 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses the provision reflects our judgment of the expense or benefit necessary to establish the appropriate amount of the allowance 
we maintain the allowance at levels adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period 
the provision is determined through detailed quarterly analyses of the loan and lease portfolio 
the provision is based on our loss experience  changes in the economic environment  as well as an ongoing assessment of our credit quality

realized investment trading gains and losses were not material in mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates and the strength of the housing market 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
we also reclassified investment securities with a carrying value of million the designated securities from the available for sale portfolio to the trading portfolio 
the change in fair value of the designated securities is intended to offset changes in valuation assumptions affecting the recorded value of our mortgage servicing rights

analysis of business segments our business segments are retail banking  commercial banking  investment services  and treasury 
our management accounting process measures the performance of the business segments based on the management structure of the company 
this process  which is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution  uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments  including allocations of income  expense  the provision  and capital 
this process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and other subjective factors 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles 
we evaluate several performance measures of the business segments  the most important of which are net income after capital charge niacc and risk adjusted return on capital raroc 
niacc is economic net income less a charge for the cost of allocated capital 
the cost of allocated capital is determined by multiplying our estimate of a shareholder s minimum required rate of return on the cost of capital invested for by the segment s allocated equity 
we assume a cost of capital that is equal to a risk free rate plus a risk premium 
raroc is the ratio of economic net income to risk adjusted equity 
equity is allocated to each business segment based on an assessment of its inherent risk 
the net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to our overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis 
the basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of our assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rates and market conditions 
funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to treasury 
however  the other business segments have some latitude to retain certain interest rate exposures related to customer pricing decisions within guidelines 
allocated net income for each segment includes a provision amount equal to net charge offs for the period 
the provision is reversed in the niacc calculation and replaced by an economic provision 
the economic provision is a statistically derived estimate of annual expected credit losses over an economic cycle 
we consider niacc to be a measure of shareholder value creation 
our niacc was million in  million in  and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our business segments

the million increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and other operating expenses 
investment services economic provision and capital charge remained relatively unchanged in financial measures improved in from primarily due to an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in noninterest expense  partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes 
the million increase in noninterest income was primarily due to an increase in the average market value of assets under management and an increase in investment advisory fees on money market accounts 
the million decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to charges for legal fees and other expenses which were incurred in the million increase in the provision for income taxes was due to higher pretax income for the investment services segment in investment services economic provision remained relatively unchanged in reductions in operating risk and the further refinement of credit risk factors resulted in a lower capital charge for the segment in treasury treasury consists of corporate asset and liability management activities  including interest rate risk management and a foreign exchange business 
this segment s assets and liabilities and related interest income and expense consist of interest bearing deposits  investment securities  federal funds sold and purchased  government deposits  and short and long term borrowings 
the primary sources of noninterest income are from bank owned life insurance and foreign exchange income related to customer driven currency requests from merchants and island visitors 
the net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in treasury  along with eliminations of inter company transactions 
financial measures decreased in from primarily due to lower net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense  partially offset by an increase in noninterest income 
the million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs associated with our deposit portfolio and an increase in the average balance of deposits funded by treasury 
the million increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to the previously mentioned million charge  which represented our share of estimated legal costs  recognized as a member bank of visa 
the million increase in noninterest income was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of real estate  a million increase in investment securities gains  and a million increase in income from bank owned life insurance 
treasury s financial results were also negatively impacted by a million increase in the capital charge 
this increase was due to higher excess equity as a result of a decrease in the unrealized loss position on our investment securities available for sale  net of tax  of million 
financial measures decreased in from primarily due to lower net interest income  partially offset by lower noninterest expense and capital charges 
the million decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs associated with our deposit portfolio and increases in both rate and volume of short term borrowings 
the million decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a reduction in share based compensation expense 
also  treasury s capital charge was favorably impacted by a reduction in our excess capital  a result of the parent s ongoing share repurchase program

market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
our market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and managing risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
our trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers 
our other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose our balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb influence  to a significant extent  the overall growth of loans  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  we  through the asset liability management committee alco  measure short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include adjusting balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 
the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has generally been limited 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans  investment securities with deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by alco 
natural and offsetting hedges reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model 
the model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  we believe that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet 
we utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  for the next twelve months subsequent to december    and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual change in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario 
the base case scenario assumes the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   our consolidated statement of condition is approximately neutral to parallel changes in interest rates 
net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  was less sensitive to changes in interest rates as compared to the sensitivity profile as of december  and to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should steepen further from its mostly normal profile  net interest income may increase 
net interest income sensitivity profile table change in net interest income december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points we also use market value of portfolio equity mvpe sensitivity to estimate the net present value change in our net assets ie  assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments from changes in interest rates 
the mvpe was approximately billion as of december  and  and approximately billion as of december  table presents  as of december    and  an estimate of the change in the mvpe that would occur from an instantaneous and basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve 
the mvpe sensitivity increased as of december  compared to december  as a result of the relative shift in the funding source for asset growth and the flat or inverted yield curve during further enhancing the mvpe sensitivity analysis are value at risk  key rate analysis  duration of equity  and exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures  however  used along with the mvpe sensitivity analysis  we obtain better overall insight for managing our exposures to changes in interest rates 
based on the additional analyses  we estimate that our greatest exposure is in scenarios where medium term rates rise on a relative basis more than short term and long term rates 
market value of equity sensitivity profile table change in market value of equity december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that we have continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funds 
funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings  liability issuances and settlements  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
we consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  we may alter our asset  liability  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to ensure that our liquidity needs are met  we actively manage our assets and liabilities 
the potential sources of short term liquidity include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including investment securities available for sale 
assets generate long term liquidity through cash flows from investment securities and loans 
with respect to liabilities  short term liquidity is generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term funding sources such as federal funds while long term liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and long term debt 
capital management the parent and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the parent and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
as of december  and  the parent and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed either the parent s or the bank s capital classifications 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
as of december   we had subordinated debt of million  of which million qualified as total capital for regulatory capital purposes 
also  as of december   we had million in capital securities outstanding  all of which qualified as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
however  the capital securities were classified as long term debt in the consolidated statements of condition 
as of december   our shareholders equity was million  an increase of million or from december  the increase in shareholders equity resulted primarily from current year earnings  which was partially offset by million in common stock repurchases  million in cash dividends paid  and million in reductions to retained earnings as a result of our adoption of several new accounting pronouncements on january  the increase in our shareholders equity was also due to a decrease in the unrealized loss position on our investment securities available for sale  net of tax  of million  which was attributable to a lower interest rate environment as of december  compared to december  we also recorded gains related to defined benefit plans  net of tax  of million 
our strategy is to maintain a capital leverage ratio of 
we achieve this by returning the majority of the annual capital generated to shareholders either through dividend payments or share repurchases 
on october   the parent s board of directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional million 
this new authorization  combined with the previously announced authorization of billion  brings the total share repurchase authority to billion
