provision for income taxes the following table shows the provision for income taxes  in dollars and the effective income tax rate in thousands  except percentages change change fiscal fiscal fiscal vs vs income tax provision effective income tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal the variance from the federal statutory rate in all periods was due primarily to the increase in our valuation allowance with respect to certain deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  the increase in the valuation allowance was largely offset by a fourth quarter benefit of the enactment of a massachusetts state tax law 
the change in law effects certain deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets and results in these liabilities being taxed at a lower effective tax rate 
as a result  a tax benefit in the amount of million was recorded 
this benefit includes an million tax benefit related to the escription acquisition which is currently treated as a stock purchase 
we can elect  if we pay approximately million in additional purchase price  to treat this acquisition as an asset purchase 
in the event we elect to treat this as an asset purchase  we will be required to reverse the million benefit as a tax provision during the quarter in which the asset election is made 
the election is required to be made no later than february  in addition to the above effect of the state tax law  it is anticipated that regulations will be issued which will impact our ability to use certain state net operating losses 
because the regulations have not been issued  we are unable to calculate the effect of these regulations 
the regulations are expected to be issued during the first calendar quarter of the tax provision expense to be recorded by us when regulations are issued could be up to approximately million 
our utilization of deferred tax assets that were acquired in a business combination primarily net operating loss carryforwards will require the reversal of the deferred tax asset in accordance with the manner in which the deferred tax asset was originally recorded and will vary based upon the business combination whose deferred tax assets are being utilized 
our establishment of new deferred tax assets as a result of operating activities requires the establishment of valuation allowances based upon the sfas more likely than not realization criteria 
the establishment of a valuation allowance relating to operating activities is recorded as an increase to tax expense 
our tax provision also includes state and foreign tax expense  which is determined on either a legal entity or separate tax jurisdiction basis

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  accounting for patent legal defense costs  the costs to complete the development of custom software 
table of contents applications  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and tangible long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  share based payments  interest rate swaps which are characterized as derivative instruments  accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances  and loss contingencies 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require its most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product and licensing revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and related authoritative literature 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for those elements 
our software arrangements generally include software and post contract support which includes telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  typically for one to three years 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable 
non software revenue is recognized in accordance with  the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab   revenue recognition in financial statements 
under sab  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fees are fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from products offered on a subscription and or hosting basis is recognized in the period the services are provided  based on a fixed minimum fee and or variable fees based on the volume of activity 
we recognize variable subscription and hosting revenue when we are notified by the customer or through management reports that such revenue is due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
set up fees from arrangements containing hosting services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual lives  or the expected lives of the customer relationships 
professional services revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain performance type contracts  on the percentage of completion method 
we generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours required to complete the project 
we consider labor hours to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  such loss is recorded in the period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
we make estimates of sales returns based on historical experience 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
we also make estimates and reduce revenue recognized for price protection and rebates  and certain marketing allowances at the time the related revenue is recorded 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual results become known 
our revenue recognition policies require management to make significant estimates 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized and thus affects our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents business combinations 
in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop in process research and development projects into commercially viable products and the estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair market value of legal performance commitments to customers  which are classified as deferred revenue 
the estimated fair market value of these obligations is determined and classified in accordance with the provisions of eitf  accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of acquiree 
other significant estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations include restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are typically comprised of severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management  but are generally subject to refinement during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date 
to estimate restructuring expenses  management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
if  as of the end of the purchase price allocation period  we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
with the exception of unresolved income tax matters  after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
in fiscal  we will adopt sfas revised  business combinations 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment assessments 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  licensed technology  patents and core technology  completed technology  customer relationships and trademarks 
all finite lived intangible assets are amortized based upon patterns in which the economic benefits are expected to be utilized 
the values of intangible assets determined in connection with a business combination  with the exception of goodwill  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  
table of contents discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for nuance s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of july  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of sfas with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review  we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are required to be evaluated periodically to ensure that their current fair value exceeds the stated book value 
based on our assessments  we have not had any impairment charges during its history as a result of our impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in fiscal  based on its review of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows  we recorded impairment charges of million  of which million was included in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets  and million was included in amortization of intangible assets 
there were no charges recorded in fiscal or relating to assessment of historic carrying amount of intangible assets 
additionally  during fiscal  and  we recorded charges of million  and million  respectively  relating to the historic portion of settlement and license agreements that we entered into with vendors licensing technology to us 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances  increased competition and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and or c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and or impairment charges 
capitalized patent defense costs 
we monitor the anticipated outcome of legal actions  and if we determine that the success of the defense of a patent is probable  and so long as we believe that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased  we then capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of these patents  up to the level of the expected increased future economic benefit 
if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  we write off any capitalized costs in the period the change is determined 
as of september  and  capitalized patent defense costs recorded in other assets totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents research and development costs 
we account for the internal costs relating to research and development activities in accordance with sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
research and development costs incurred for new software products and enhancements to existing products  other than certain software development costs that qualify for capitalization  are expensed as incurred 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility  but prior to the general release of the product  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated useful life of the related products 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility is reached shortly before the general release of our software products 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material  and accordingly  we have expensed the internal costs relating to research and development when incurred 
accounting for share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  share price volatility and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we do not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
we make judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets is based on the belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets after consideration of all available evidence 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances have been established for us deferred tax assets  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas if we are subsequently able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to its results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined  excluding the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination or created as a result of share based payments 
the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets resulting from share based payments will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination will reduce goodwill  intangible assets  and to the extent remaining  the provision for income taxes 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims relating to labor  service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business  as discussed in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposure has related to transactions denominated in the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  japanese yen  israeli new shekel  indian rupee and hungarian forint 
a hypothetical change of in appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at september  would not have a material impact on our revenue  operating results or cash flows 
occasionally  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into as economic hedges  but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes as defined under sfas the notional contract amount of these outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was not material at september  and a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial results 
during the fiscal year and  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million and gains of million  respectively 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our significant cash and cash equivalents  and the outstanding debt under the expanded credit facility 
at september   we held approximately million of cash and cash equivalents primarily consisting of cash and money market funds and million of short term marketable securities 
due to the low current market yields and the short term nature of our investments  a hypothetical change in market rates of one percentage point would not have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio or results of operations 
at september   our total outstanding debt balance exposed to variable interest rates was million 
to partially offset this variable interest rate exposure  we entered into a three year interest rate swap with a notional value of million in march the interest rate swap is structured to offset period changes in the variable interest rate without changing the characteristics of the underlying debt instrument 
a hypothetical change in market rates would have a significant impact on the interest expense and amounts payable relating to the million of debt that is not offset by the interest rate swap  assuming a one percentage point change in interest rates  the interest expense would increase million per annum 
subsequent to september   we entered into two additional two year interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million
