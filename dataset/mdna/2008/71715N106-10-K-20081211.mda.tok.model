overview we are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections 
our primary focus is on the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of hepatitis b virus  or hbv  hepatitis c virus  or hcv  and human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv 
our research and development efforts focus on a class of compounds known as nucleoside analogs  which act to inhibit the natural enzymes required for viral replication 
we currently have three clinical stage product candidates  two of which we are developing ourselves and one of which we are developing with a strategic partner clevudine  for the treatment of chronic hbv infection  is enrolling phase clinical trials for registration in north  central  and south america the americas and europe  r  a pro drug of psi for the treatment of hcv  has completed phase clinical trials in combination with pegasys plus copegus through a strategic collaboration with f 
hoffmann laroche ltd 
and hoffmann la roche inc collectively  roche  and racivir  for the treatment of hiv  which has completed a phase clinical trial 
we have also identified proprietary  next generation hcv development candidates that are being evaluated for advancement into clinical development 
one of these compounds  psi  was recently nominated as a lead candidate and is being advanced into good laboratory practice glp toxicity studies required for submission of an ind application with the fda or an equivalent foreign regulatory filing 
clevudine clevudine is an oral  once daily pyrimidine nucleoside analog that we are developing for the treatment of hbv 
we licensed clevudine from bukwang  a korean pharmaceutical company 
bukwang received final product approval from korean regulators in december and commercially launched clevudine in the korean market in february under the brand name levovir 
in two completed korean phase clinical trials in patients  studies and  clevudine demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce hbv viral load in patients to undetectable levels and normalized liver enzyme levels 
furthermore  in study  of the e antigen negative patients who had received clevudine demonstrated a sustained virologic response svr weeks after stopping therapy  versus of the patients who had received the placebo 
in march  bukwang completed study  a korean open label follow on study of clevudine in hbv patients  including e antigen negative patients and who were treatment na ve patients 
the results of study are consistent with the results of studies and in terms of significantly reducing hbv viral load in patients to undetectable levels and normalizing liver enzyme levels 
additionally  in study  of e antigen negative patients sustained a viral load that was undetectable weeks after completing the week course of therapy 
we initiated two phase clinical trials of clevudine for registration in the americas and europe during the third calendar quarter of the clevudine registration studies include two week phase clinical trials 
table of contents designed to test the superiority of once daily doses of clevudine mg over hepsera mg adefovir on predetermined primary and secondary endpoints 
study will be conducted in approximately e antigen positive patients  and study will be conducted in approximately e antigen negative patients 
the primary endpoint of these registration studies is expected to be a composite endpoint measuring the percentage of patients with undetectable hbv dna less than copies ml and the normalization of liver enzyme levels at weeks on therapy 
we plan to continue the clevudine phase studies from week to week to gather additional safety and efficacy data  as well as assess clevudine s svr rate for hbv 
r during september  we completed the clinical activities in part of a phase clinical trial with r that was initiated by roche and us in october under an ind filing 
this expanded phase trial was a multiple center  observer blinded  randomized and placebo controlled study designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  safety  tolerability and food effect of r in healthy volunteers and in patients chronically infected with hcv genotype  or this phase trial also provided antiviral potency data over and days in patients chronically infected with hcv genotype and following days of treatment in patients chronically infected with hcv genotypes or this adaptive phase study was comprised of three parts part was a single ascending dose study conducted in healthy volunteers 
the primary objective of part was to assess the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of r following single ascending doses under fasting conditions 
the secondary objective of part was to explore the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of r single oral doses of r were administered to healthy volunteers in five sequential dose groups mg  mg  mg  mg and mg and one food effect group mg 
results from the single ascending dose portion of the study indicated all doses of r studied mg to mg were generally safe and well tolerated 
all patients completed the study  and none experienced gastrointestinal adverse events or serious adverse events during the study 
no hematologic or other safety laboratory abnormalities of clinical significance were noted 
no maximum tolerated dose was identified 
part was a multiple ascending dose study conducted in patients chronically infected with hcv genotype who had previously failed interferon therapy 
the primary objective of part was to assess the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of r after once daily qd or twice daily bid dosing for days 
the secondary objective was to assess antiviral efficacy by measuring the change in hcv rna 
results from the multiple ascending dose portion of the study indicated r demonstrated potent  dose dependent antiviral activity in four patient cohorts active  placebo per cohort receiving mg or mg administered either qd or bid for days as monotherapy 
the maximum decrease in hcv rna from baseline was demonstrated in the patient cohort that received mg bid 
r demonstrated mean hcv rna decreases from baseline of log reduction  log reduction  log reduction and log reduction in patients receiving mg qd  mg qd  mg bid and mg bid  respectively 
based on the mean data  all four dose groups reached nadir values at day a maximum log reduction hcv rna decrease was demonstrated in a patient following days of monotherapy with mg bid of r  a value also below the level of detection  which was less than international units per milliliter iu ml 
there was no evidence of viral rebound in any dose cohort during the days of dosing 
r was generally safe and well tolerated over days of treatment of patients chronically infected with hcv genotype who had previously failed interferon therapy 
there were no serious adverse events  no adverse events requiring dose modification  and no dose related gastrointestinal adverse events 

table of contents part was a week study of r in combination with the current standard of care for chronic hcv infection  pegasys pegylated interferon plus copegus ribavirin in treatment na ve patients chronically infected with hcv genotype  and additionally  in prior treatment non responders  or patients who did not achieve an svr with previous interferon based therapy  who were chronically infected with hcv genotypes or the primary objective of this study was to assess the safety  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics of r in the clinically relevant setting of combination therapy with the current standard of care for chronic hcv infection 
the secondary objective of part was to evaluate the short term change in hcv rna 
the study included three oral dose regimens of r mg  mg and mg cohorts  and  respectively in patients chronically infected with hcv genotype and one oral dose regimen of r mg cohort in patients chronically infected with hcv genotypes or all four dose regimens were administered twice daily with pegasys plus copegus for weeks 
dose cohorts  and enrolled patients  with patients randomized to receive r and five patients randomized to receive placebo  and cohort enrolled patients  with patients randomized to receive r and six patients randomized to receive placebo  all administered in combination with standard of care 
after completing four weeks of the triple combination regimen and a follow up of four weeks of pegasys plus copegus  all patients are scheduled to receive up to weeks of open label standard of care dosing under a separate protocol 
results from cohorts  and in treatment na ve patients chronically infected with hcv genotype indicated following weeks of treatment with r mg bid with pegasys plus copegus cohort  patients achieved a mean log iu ml decrease in hcv rna and of achieved undetectable levels of hcv rna iu ml  or rapid virologic response rvr 
following weeks of treatment with r mg bid with pegasys plus copegus cohort  patients achieved a mean log iu ml decrease in hcv rna and of achieved rvr 
following weeks of treatment with r mg bid with pegasys plus copegus cohort  preliminary results indicated patients achieved a mean log iu ml decrease in hcv rna and of patients achieved rvr 
following weeks of treatment with placebo with pegasys plus copegus  patients achieved a mean log iu ml decrease in hcv rna and of achieved rvr 
for cohorts  and in treatment na ve genotype patients  safety and tolerability for the week treatment period were similar for r with pegasys plus copegus compared to placebo with pegasys plus copegus 
there were no serious adverse events reported during the week treatment periods of triple therapy  and most of the adverse events reported were of mild to moderate intensity 
headache and fatigue were the most frequently reported adverse events in patients who received active r plus pegasys plus copegus  with an overall frequency of and reporting at least one of these events  respectively 
these events were also the most frequently reported adverse events in patients who received placebo with pegasys and copegus 
in general  the adverse events reported were consistent with the clinical safety profile for pegasys and copegus  including the frequency and severity of these adverse events  as well as any general body system observations 
grade neutropenia was observed in of the placebo patients and in to of the r patients in each active dosing cohort 
grade changes in hemoglobin were observed in of the placebo patients and in of the r patients 
there were no clinically significant changes in hepatic  renal  or other safety laboratory parameters  vital signs  or electrocardiograms 
overall  there was no clinical evidence of any major organ toxicities related to r one patient in the active treatment group discontinued the study during the week treatment period due to lower gastrointestinal adverse events 
at the time of study discontinuation  this patient had undetectable hcv rna 
r was generally safe and well tolerated when administered for weeks in combinations with pegasus plus copegus in patients with hcv genotype 
table of contents results from the mg dose cohort cohort in prior treatment non responders  or patients who did not achieve an svr with previous interferon based therapy  and who were chronically infected with hcv genotypes or indicated following weeks of treatment with r mg bid with pegasys plus copegus cohort  preliminary results indicated patients achieved a mean log 
iu ml decrease in hcv rna and of patients achieved rvr 
following weeks of treatment with placebo with pegasys plus copegus  patients achieved a mean log 
iu ml decrease in hcv rna and of achieved rvr 
for cohort  safety and tolerability during the week treatment period were similar for r with pegasys plus copegus compared to placebo with pegasys plus copegus 
there were no serious adverse events reported during the week treatment period  and most of the adverse events reported were of mild to moderate intensity 
one subject discontinued r  pegasys and copegus due to protocol specified stopping criteria not treatment emergent  and ecg changes 
adverse events reported in cohort were similar to those reported in cohorts grade neutropenia was observed in of the placebo patients and in of the r patients in the active dosing cohort 
grade changes in hemoglobin were observed in of the placebo patients and in of the r patients 
there were no clinically significant changes in hepatic  renal  or other safety laboratory parameters  vital signs  or electrocardiograms 
as seen in the patients infected with hcv genotype  there was no clinical evidence of any major organ toxicities related to r r was generally safe and well tolerated when administered for weeks in combination with pegasus plus copegus in patients with hcv genotypes and we cannot guarantee that the final results of this study or any future study of r will corroborate earlier results  and further testing will be required to provide sufficient evidence regarding safety and efficacy to support an nda filing with the fda in the future 
we and roche expect to meet with the fda during january to discuss a phase b study plan  as well as additional studies to support desired product label claims 
on october   we were informed by the fda that r received fast track designation 
mechanism of action 
in a study evaluating the mechanism of action of psi  the compound was found to be active against the hcv rna polymerase by terminating hcv rna synthesis 
preclinical development 
we and roche have performed and will continue to perform in vitro and animal studies to determine the preclinical pharmacokinetics and safety of psi administered as its pro drug  r psi did not cause genetic mutations or cellular damage in preclinical models 
the goal of longer term animal studies is to identify the potential target organs and to determine the reversibility and monitorability of changes to their function and physical structure 
in general  following single and repeated doses  r was well tolerated in mice up to weeks  rats up to months  and dogs up to weeks up to the highest doses tested mg kg day for repeat dose studies 
manifestations of toxicity in monkeys  the most sensitive species tested  appeared to be time and dose dependent  causing significant changes in the kidney 
oral administration of r at doses of  and mg kg day in monkeys  in a study designed to be six months but stopped at weeks  did not establish a no observed adverse effect level noael dose 
a thorough examination of the monkeys tissues in every organ system determined that the only significant treatment related pathology changes were confined to the glomeruli of the kidney 
we believe these changes were dose related  appearing in all animals in the high and middle dose groups and one animal in the low dose group  in which the glomerulopathy appeared in a much milder form 
no scarring was observed  so changes were considered likely to be reversible 
a second long term r safety study in monkeys began in april at doses of    and mg kg day  administered for weeks in preparation for the start of a phase b study in which humans are 
table of contents expected to receive r for up to weeks 
histopathology data confirmed the glomerulopathy findings in the previous study 
in addition  in animals that had been followed for an additional weeks after treatment was stopped  renal function had returned to normal as measured by standard tests of kidney function 
therefore  we believe the changes in kidney function observed in monkeys are both reversible and monitorable 
in this study  we established a noael dose in monkeys over weeks 
in january  roche completed the dosing portion of a six month safety study of r in rats 
the results of this study revealed no toxicities at any dose level tested  which were  and mg kg day 
in  roche completed a week safety study of r in mice 
the results of this study showed that the drug was well tolerated with no observable toxicities at any dose level tested  which were  and mg kg day 
species specific differences in drug metabolism and excretion that may render the monkey more susceptible to the pathology changes observed with r than the rat or humans continue to be under review 
psi we are developing psi for the treatment of hcv 
psi was nominated as a lead candidate and has advanced into preclinical safety studies required for submission of an ind application with the fda or an equivalent foreign regulatory filing 
this pyrimidine nucleotide analog is being investigated as part of our research and development efforts to identify another compound that might be used in a proprietary combination treatment for hcv 
in vitro antiviral testing has shown that this compound is approximately fold more potent than psi in animal studies following oral dosing  psi preferentially localizes in liver cells where it is efficiently converted to the active triphosphate form 
the rapid and efficient delivery to liver cells and the improved in vitro potency observed in our early preclinical studies may allow for lower and less frequent dosing in the clinic 
we anticipate filing an ind with the fda during the first calendar quarter of purine research we are researching a third generation of nucleosides and nucleotides utilizing a purine base with the goal of generating a product candidate that has comparable activity to psi and a resistance profile that is complementary to psi to enable a proprietary fixed dose combination that has the potential to eliminate or reduce the use of interferon for the treatment of hcv 
racivir racivir is an oral  once daily deoxycytidine nucleoside analog that we are developing as an hiv therapy for use in combination with other approved hiv drugs 
in a recently completed phase clinical trial  for the subset of patients carrying the mv mutation and less than three thymidine analog mutations  replacing lamivudine with racivir in their existing combination therapies caused a mean decrease in plasma hiv rna of log reduction in the second week of treatment 
twenty eight percent of these patients achieved an undetectable level of virus less than copies per milliliter and of these patients achieved at least a log decrease reduction in plasma hiv rna 
dfc dfc is an oral  once daily cytidine nucleoside analog 
we had been developing dfc in collaboration with incyte corporation incyte until april when incyte terminated our collaborative and license agreements and returned its rights related to dfc to us 
we have analyzed the preclinical and clinical data on dfc generated by incyte 
a path for further development of dfc has not yet been identified 

table of contents results of all prior clinical trials do not provide enough evidence to support an nda filing with the fda and additional trials will be needed 
results of all of our ongoing trials and any future trials we may conduct may not corroborate earlier results 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception because we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development activities and have not generated any revenue from the sale of approved drugs 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our operating losses to increase for at least the next several years as we continue to pursue the clinical development of clevudine  racivir and our other product candidates  and as we expand our discovery and development pipeline 
we expect our compensation expense to increase in the future as well  as we implement our planned increase in the number of our employees 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments received under collaboration agreements  borrowings under our loan agreement  government grants and interest earned on investments 
we expect to continue to fund our operations over the next several years through the net proceeds of our completed public offerings  our existing cash resources  borrowings under our loan agreement  potential future milestone payments that we expect to receive from roche if certain conditions are satisfied  interest earned on our investments and additional capital to be raised through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as of september   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of short term investments 
revenues all of our product candidates are currently in development  and  therefore  we do not expect to generate any direct revenues from drug product sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated primarily from milestone payments under our collaboration agreements  license fees  research funding and grants 
we currently have one collaboration agreement with roche for the development of psi  its pro drugs 
we entered into our collaboration agreement with roche in october roche subsequently paid us an up front payment of million 
pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement with roche  we did not receive any milestone payments during the year ended september  as of september   we had received an aggregate of million in payments under the roche collaboration agreement  including research funding and related fees as well as up front and milestone payments 
under the current terms of the roche collaboration agreement  if we succeed in obtaining all of the regulatory approvals specified in the agreement for psi or a pro drug of psi  including r  as of september  the maximum future development and commercialization milestone payments payable to us are million 
receipt of any additional milestone payments depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will receive any of these future payments 
additional milestone funding may be payable to us if molecules in addition to psi or its pro drugs are developed under the roche agreement 
we expect our revenues for the next several years to be derived primarily from payments under our current collaboration agreement with roche and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future 
in addition to the payments described above  we may receive future royalties on product sales  if any  under our collaboration agreement with roche 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to external service providers  up front and milestone payments under our license agreements  patent related legal fees  costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials  drug and laboratory supplies and costs for facilities and 
table of contents equipment 
we use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials and for the majority of our preclinical and clinical development work 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our development activities are primarily focused on the development of clevudine  racivir and r  and our research activities are primarily focused on discovering and developing novel drugs such as psi  to treat viral infections 
we are responsible for all costs incurred in the future in the clinical development of clevudine for registration in the americas  europe and certain other territories  where we have the rights to develop and commercialize clevudine  which we in licensed from bukwang 
we are responsible for all costs incurred in the clinical development of racivir  as well as the research costs associated with our other internal research programs 
under our collaboration with roche  roche will fund the clinical development and commercialization of psi and its pro drugs  including r under this collaboration  roche reimbursed us for all of the external expenses associated with  and we were responsible for  certain preclinical work  the ind filing  and the proof of concept clinical trial 
going forward  roche will fund all of the expenses of  and be responsible for  other preclinical studies and future clinical development 
we will continue to develop and retain worldwide rights to ongoing and future hcv programs unrelated to the psi series of nucleoside polymerase inhibitors licensed to roche 
incyte had been funding the clinical development and commercialization of dfc  but since its return to us by incyte in april  we are responsible for any additional expenses 
we are currently focused on advancing the clinical development of clevudine  racivir and r in collaboration with roche  as well as advancing the preclinical development of psi we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis 
these determinations will be made in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
clevudine is in phase registration clinical trials which commenced dosing during the third calendar quarter of we currently estimate it will cost approximately million  excluding internal personnel costs associated with conducting these two registration trials  to progress clevudine s clinical program from september  to the point of enabling the filing of an nda with the fda 
we do not believe  however  that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization for clevudine or any of our other product candidates  as there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates  including future trial design and various regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our product development efforts 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates  or the ultimate product development cost or whether we will obtain any approval required by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay preliminary studies or clinical trials for a product candidate or development program in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially as we continue the clinical development of clevudine and racivir and as we continue our research and development activities 
the maximum aggregate future milestone payments related to clevudine that we will have to pay to bukwang if we succeed in obtaining all of the regulatory approvals and reach all marketing milestones specified in our agreement with bukwang are million 
additionally  we may pay up to an aggregate of million in future milestone payments related to development and regulatory events under our license agreement for dioxolane thymine dot with rfs pharma llc

on september   we entered into a loan agreement that allowed us to borrow up to million in million increments 
we borrowed the first and second million increments by signing two secured promissory notes notes on october  and march   respectively 
the notes bear interest at and are to be repaid over a month period with the first monthly payments representing interest only followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest 
the principal monthly repayments on the first million begin on march  and end on august  the principal monthly repayments on the second million begin on august  and end on january  total principal repayments of the two notes amount to million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we are currently in the process of amending the loan agreement to extend the commitment beyond its original expiration date of november  and to draw down million  and no more  of the remaining facility 
prepayment of the loans made pursuant to the loan agreement is subject to penalty and substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets except for intellectual property are collateral for the loan agreement 
under the loan agreement  we agreed that in the event our market capitalization is below million for consecutive days in which the principal market for our common stock is open for trading to the public  we will repay of the then outstanding principal balance of the loans 
we further agreed that in the event our market capitalization is below million for consecutive days in which the principal market for our common stock is open for trading to the public  we will repay all of the then outstanding principal balance of the loans 
the loan agreement also contains covenants that  among other things  require us to obtain consent from the lender prior to paying dividends  making certain investments  changing the nature of our business  assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual  selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets  or merging or consolidating with another entity 
developing drugs  conducting clinical trials and commercializing products is expensive and we will need to raise substantial additional funds to achieve our strategic objectives 
although we believe our existing cash resources  together with anticipated payments under our existing collaboration agreements  will be sufficient to fund our projected cash requirements for the next months  we will require significant additional financing in the future to complete our clinical trials for clevudine and fund our other operations 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of our clinical trials and other research and development programs  the amount of revenues we receive under our collaboration agreements  the costs of the development and expansion of our operational infrastructure  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates  the ability of our collaborators to achieve development milestones  marketing approval and other events or developments under our collaboration agreements  the costs of filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
table of contents the costs and timing of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production  the costs of establishing sales and marketing capabilities or contracting with third parties to provide these capabilities for us  the costs of acquiring or undertaking development and commercialization efforts for any future product candidates  the magnitude of our general and administrative expenses  and any costs that we may incur under current and future licensing arrangements relating to our product candidates 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through payments received under our collaborations  debt or equity financings  or by out licensing other product candidates 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
contractual obligations and commitments in may  we entered into an operating lease for office and laboratory space through may   in princeton  new jersey 
in april  we entered into a lease for office space in durham  north carolina through april  in december  we entered into a capital lease for lab equipment with monthly payments beginning in january through december in october and march  we executed two secured promissory notes totaling million 
pursuant to the terms of the secured promissory notes  we are required to make payments of interest only for the first months followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest 
as of september   future payments under the loan agreement  capital leases and minimum future payments under non cancellable operating leases are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital lease obligations debt maturities contractual interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations the above contractual obligations table does not include amounts for milestone payments related to development  regulatory or commercialization events to licensors or collaboration partners  as the payments are contingent on the achievement of these milestones  which we have not achieved 
dot  which we licensed from rfs pharma  is in the early stage of research and therefore it is not possible to predict when we would need to make a milestone payment 
we may pay up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments and certain cost reimbursements if we reach milestones related to development and regulatory events under our license agreement with rfs pharma llc 
we also agreed to pay emory university up to an aggregate of million in future marketing milestone payments under our license agreement for dfc 
under our collaboration and license agreement with bukwang  in the future we may pay up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments related to development  regulatory and commercialization events

table of contents off balance sheet transactions to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ substantially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  however  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets  we follow the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with sab no 
and eitf no 
 the elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborator and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units either on the basis of each unit s fair value or using the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
our revenues are primarily related to our collaboration agreements  and these agreements provide for various types of payments to us  including non refundable upfront license fees  research and development payments  and milestone payments 
where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaboration agreement  non refundable upfront license payments received upon contract signing are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as the related activities are performed 
the period over which these activities are to be performed is based upon our estimate of the development period 
changes in our estimate could change the period over which revenue is recognized 
payments for research funding are recognized as revenues as the related research activities are performed 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments when earned  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii we do not have ongoing performance obligations 
milestone payments are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payment is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
any amounts received under the agreements in advance of performance  if deemed substantive  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 

table of contents where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record nonrefundable license fee revenues when we have the contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  and records milestones upon appropriate notification to us of achievement of the milestones by the collaborative partner 
deferred revenues associated with a non refundable payment received under a collaborative agreement that is terminated prior to its completion result in an immediate recognition of the deferred revenues 
accrued expenses we are required to estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed on our behalf and the associated cost incurred in instances where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we account for expenses associated with these external services by determining the total cost of a given study based on the terms of the related contract 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  the estimated cost normally relates to the projected costs of treating the patients in our trials  which we recognize over the estimated term of the trial according to the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  the number of clinical trials and related research service agreements has been relatively limited and our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
we expect  however  as clinical trials for clevudine  racivir and r advance  that our estimated accruals for clinical and research services will be more material to our operations in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments based on grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which results in recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards granted or modified after october  as well as all unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
the cost is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the instruments  based upon the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
prior to october   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and had adopted the pro forma disclosure option for stock based employee compensation under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  equity instruments granted to consultants are periodically valued and recorded as stock compensation expense as the equity instrument vests 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on us 
on february   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and 
table of contents certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on us 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed  or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided 
this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and earlier application is not permitted 
this consensus is to be applied prospectively for new contracts entered into on or after the effective date 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on us 
in december  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the eitf concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf and other accounting literature 
based on the nature of the arrangement  payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and the terms  the nature of the entity s business  and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented 
companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf  however we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r which changes the accounting for business acquisitions 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this standard will  among other things  impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration  exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets  and tax benefits 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on us 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 sfas which establishes new standards governing the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests ncis in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
certain provisions of this standard indicate  among other things  that ncis previously referred to as minority interests be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability  that increases and decrease in the parent s ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions  rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses  and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the nci even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance 
this standard also requires changes to certain presentation and disclosure requirements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of the standard are to be applied to all ncis prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which are to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our excess cash in high quality  interest bearing securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid mutual and money market funds  and high quality marketable debt instruments of corporations  government agencies and financial institutions with maturities of less than two years 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on september   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
in addition  the million we borrowed during the twelve months ended has a fixed interest rate of 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have entered into some agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in foreign currencies  and  in the future  we may enter into additional  agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
if the values of these currencies increase against the united states dollar  our costs would increase 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results
